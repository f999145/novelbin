It all started fifty years ago.
In a region that was a good distance away from the Shaufell Valley, a colony of Blaze Coned Termites thrived.
This particular colony was fairly young and only numbered tens of thousands.
It was also the place where I was born.
The moment I hatched from the egg, my destiny had already been laid out for me. Unlike the Worker Termites, my role was to guard and protect our colony from any kind of threat.
Our territory was near a volcano, so our bodies had evolved to adapt to it, making us very resistant to fire.
As our numbers grew, my comrades expanded our area of influence. Because of this, we encountered our fair share of powerful Beasts who mercilessly killed our kind.

Of course, I'm not saying that we were free from fault because Blaze Coned Termites were very aggressive and very territorial. Every single encounter we faced automatically led to a confrontation.
When Worker Termites died in the field, if their bodies were not consumed by the one that killed them, it would release a scent, informing us that one of our comrades had died.
This in turn would signal soldiers, like me, to investigate what happened, and we would deal with whatever Creature dared to kill one of our brethren.
Back then, I was only a newly born Rank 3 Monster, but since I was a Soldier Termite, I joined a scouting party to investigate the cause of death of one of our members that had traveled outside our borders.
This was a very common thing since our nest was expanding, and the Worker Termites were always looking for food and other resources to provide for the entire colony.
Back then, I thought we were going to face some Fire Beetles, whom we usually found in our territory. These creatures were stronger than us, but we had the advantage when it came to numbers, so a battle between Quality and Quantity was a daily occurrence.
Unfortunately, what we found weren't beetles…
They were Ants…
Fire Ants to be exact.
Just like my comrade who perished under their hands, they were also expanding their territories, and our workers just happened to meet each other, which led to a confrontation.
I could still remember that day very clearly, for it was the day that everything that I cared for in the world… perished.
The moment our two sides met, war was inevitable.
Ants and Termites simply couldn't co-exist under the same sun. Unfortunately, our Nest was fairly young. The Ant Colony that took the initiative to attack us numbered in the Hundreds of Thousands, which put us at a great disadvantage.
Our race heavily relied on Fire Attacks to incinerate our foes to ashes, but our opponents were resistant to fire just like us.
The Fire Ants were too similar to us—they could also use Fire Attacks. However, they didn't fight with that. Instead, they used brute force and numbers to overwhelm our Colony.
Back then, our Sole Deimos-Ranked comrade fought against three Deimos-Ranked Ants to death.
I could still remember how he fought with everything he had, with his entire body burning like molten lava, illuminating that dark and nightmarish night.
All of us fought bravely. Soldiers and Workers fought with everything we had to protect our Colony and our Queen.
However, no matter how many of my brethren sacrificed their lives, we couldn't change the inevitable.
The moment our Deimos-Ranked Fighter fell, everything went downhill.
My comrades died right before my eyes, and I was among those that fell, or at least that was what I thought at that time.
I didn't know what happened after I lost consciousness, but when I opened my eyes, our nest was already destroyed.
Countless bodies of Ants and Termites were scattered across the ground. It was a scene of complete and utter carnage.
A scene that I will never forget till I draw my last breath.
 Originally, our bodies should have been collected by the victors and used as food to nourish their colonies. However, for some reason, it didn't happen.
It was then that I saw it…
A fifteen-meter-tall Monster, whose mere presence was enough to make my body uncontrollably shudder.
Back then, I didn't know what it was. Later, my friend Drystan told me the name of the monster that was considered to be the Bane of the Ants' and Termites' existence.
It was none other than an Adamantium-Scaled Anteater.
Its powerful aura was said to reduce the strength of all Ants and Termites to only a tenth of their original strength, making them unable to launch an effective counterattack against it.
Even the Ants, who emerged victorious in the war against us, were all slain by it, making it the true winner of the war that we had fought against each other.
Perhaps it was a sick joke from Fate, but I woke up at the moment when the monster was about to eat our Queen.
The Spiritual Leader of our Colony whom we tried to protect with everything we had. As if sensing my gaze, the Anteater glanced in my direction and looked at me with a teasing glint in its eyes.
It then ate my helpless Queen in front of me, watching my anguished expression as it ate with relish.
I had no choice but to watch it from beginning to end because I couldn't move any part of my body. I was paralyzed by both fear and grief. Even if the Anteater had decided to kill me back then, I would have thought of it as a form of release.
A release from the nightmare that I just witnessed.
However, after eating my Queen, it didn't eat me. It only laughed.
A sickening and maddening laugh that made me wish that it had killed me instead. But, it didn't do that.
Perhaps, in its eyes, a mere Rank 3 Monster like me wasn't worthy of being eaten by an Argonaut Ranked Creature like him.
After seeing my agony and pain, it finally left and headed in the direction of the Fire Ant Colony.
Perhaps, it would feast on their Queen as well, just like it did to mine. But, I was beyond caring at that point.
I didn't know how long I stayed frozen in that spot. But since I was seriously injured, I couldn't move even if I wanted to.
That was when he appeared.
A Human, and my one and only friend in the world. Drystan.
"Fate has allowed you to live, so you must live."
That was how the two of us met, and that was how I was given a second chance at life.
"Fate has allowed you to live, so you must live."
Those were the words that he said to me back then, and without even caring that I was a Monster, he treated my injury.
There were many times when I wished that he had just killed me and taken my Beast Core. The war that happened that night haunted me to the present day, always making me wonder why I lived when my entire colony perished.
The first thing I did the day after I recovered was to scavenge the battlefield, looking for Beast Cores to eat.
My Natural Instinct urged me to rummage through the countless dead, looking for the cores that would allow me to become stronger. Although tens of thousands of corpses were all over the place, I was only able to get over a hundred cores in total.
Whenever we killed a monster, the first thing we target is our opponent's Beast Core, so we can eat it.
Perhaps, the appearance of the Anteater forced the Ants to stop their feeding frenzy and make a hasty retreat back to their nest, to warn their Queen that their mortal enemy had arrived.
So, I ate what cores were left and increased my Rank from Rank 3 to Rank 4.
Drystan didn't say anything back then and simply observed me from a distance. Since he was my savior, I didn't attack him--was what I'd like to say.
I knew that if I did attack him, the one who would end up dying was me.
The man who saved me was an Initiate, and if he wished, he could have killed me anytime he wanted.
But he wanted me to live, and so I did.
"Your Colony is gone," Drystan said after I finished eating all the cores that I could find on the battlefield. "How about you come with me and follow me on my adventures?"
As a Soldier Termite, the only thing I knew how to do was to fight, so I agreed to his proposal.
He made me his Beast Companion, and he gave me a new purpose in life. Everything was fine and we both increased our Ranks exponentially during our travels.
I became a Deimos-Ranked Monster, while he became a Ranker. Unfortunately, during one of our adventures, Drystan was heavily poisoned by a Poisonous Tree Frog. This poison didn't have a cure, and he had only been able to suppress it for a short time because he was a Ranker.
Even so, as the years passed, the poison's effects gradually spread inside his body, making his Rank Degrade from Ranker, to Initiate, to Apostle.
His once powerful body slowly weakened, but even in that state, he didn't feel down.
Drystan returned to his town and became a Mayor, using the remaining years of his life to make Abingdon Town the center of commerce.
For my part, I did my best to protect the town he had built from the shadows and eliminated anything that could pose a threat to it.
I also made Isoptera Mountain my home.
It was far enough from Abingdon Town so that people wouldn't be threatened by my existence, but near enough to lend my aid if my dear friend needed it.
Drystan would visit me from time to time every time he wasn't busy with work and would stay with me for a few days to make sure that I was doing well.
He was the only man I truly cared for, and perhaps, I even treated him as a member of my own Colony.
 n0/v//el/bin[./]net'
The Humans call this term Family, and I'm sure that deep in his heart, Drystan also thought of me that way.
But, just like how our nest was destroyed, the inevitable happened. My friend succumbed to the poison's effect and died, leaving me and his beloved town behind.
Perhaps, knowing that his time was near, he visited me one last time.
Back then, I didn't know how he was feeling because he was laughing and smiling despite the pain, and called me the Unsung Hero of Abingdon Town.
The term Hero was new to me, so I asked him what a Hero was.
"Heroes are ordinary people who make themselves extraordinary," Drystan answered. "A Hero is someone who has given his or her life to something bigger than oneself."
 "But I'm a termite," I replied back then. "I'm not Human like you."
"Termite, Ants, Monsters, Humans, Dwarves, Elves? What's the difference? Anyone can be a Hero."
"Can I really be a Hero too?"
"Yes. You can be a Hero too."
That was the last time I saw my friend, and I only knew he died because his contract with me disappeared on the day of his death.
Since then, I stayed on Isoptera Mountain, waiting for the day when I would be reunited with him in the afterlife.
On the day Drystan died, I didn't only lose my one and only friend and family member, but also my reason for living.
He was the one that saved me and gave meaning to my life. Without him, the hole that had been covered up in my heart opened once again, making me feel that life was no longer worth living.
The days were long, and the nights were cold. There were times when I contemplated whether I should just kill myself to end my suffering.
But whenever this thought passed through my head, the words he told me when we first met would resonate inside my heart, forcing me to cancel my thoughts of self-harm.
"Fate has allowed you to live, so you must live."
I sighed as I looked at the setting sun in the distance.
"It seems like Fate must really hate me then," I said softly. "How long do I have to wait until the end of my suffering?"
After the Half-Elf and the Dragon Born left, I reminisced on the happy days of my life, just as I always did every day.
My recollection would always end with the last time my friend visited me. The fleeting warmth and happiness that I would feel after that kept the thoughts of killing myself at bay, at least until the sun rose the next day.
"Since you are no longer here, I stopped repelling the monsters that have started to thrive in the Shaufell Plains," I said as I looked at the burning sun in the distance, which reminded me of the happy days that would no longer return.
"An Abingdon Town without you will never be the same. I might be vain, selfish, and ungrateful, but since you left me all alone, I decided to abandon the town that you have built as well.
"I'm sorry, Drystan. I guess not anyone can be a Hero like you said. I am no Hero. I am just the last survivor of a Colony that has long been buried by the sands of time, never to return again and will only linger as faint traces in my memory."
I survived alone, and I will die alone. That was what I had already decided.
Although this ending was not the one I envisioned when I became your Beast Companion, the years that I spent with you  were still the happiest years of my life.

Lux covered his body with the Favonius Legacy Armor and flew in the air. He would handle the Field Boss Monster, while his subordinates handled the rest.
Summoning his Doppelgangers, he immediately unleashed a Dragon's Breath with the intention of pushing the Giant Ground Beetle backwards.
His priority was the safety of the people. For that to happen, he needed to prevent the Field Boss Monster from nearing the procession of evacuees, who had all stopped in their tracks with grim expressions on their faces.
Eiko, who was sitting on top of Asmodeus' head, wanted to head off into battle, but Lux had asked her to protect Grandma Annie, Laura, and Livia alongside Asmodeus.
The Baby Slime might be a battle junkie, but she cared for the kind grandma, and the two little girls who were taking good care of their own baby slimes, Cora and Nora.
Eiko would not allow them to get hurt, so she simply cheered her Papa on from a distance.
"Pa!"
"Fight!"
"Pa!"
"Fight!"
Asmodeus chuckled as the Baby Slime on top of his head jumped up and down, while calling out to his Master, who was taking on the Field Boss Monster by himself.
With two Doppelgangers by his side, although the enemy was stronger, and more sturdy than he was, the Half-Elf was confident that he would be able to chip away its life little by little.
Magical arrows rained down upon the Giant Ground Beetles, as Lux's newly evolved, Skeleton Arcane Hunters, joined the fray.
Upon clearing the Gate of Conquest, the Skeleton Grand Archers had gotten a free profession upgrade, which made Lux very happy.
The unique abilities of the Skeleton Arcane Hunters was a welcome addition to the Half-Elf's growing Army.
These ranged attackers had the power to imbue their arrows with elemental magic, which allowed them to increase their damage significantly. Not only that, they had the skill, Wild Focus, allowing them to imitate the abilities of certain creatures.
For example, they could imitate the sharp sightedness of Eagles and Hawks, allowing them to see farther and clearer. They could also imitate the agility and dexterity of monkeys, giving them the ability to climb trees and mountains faster.
Of course, these boosts in abilities weren't permanent, and only lasted for half an hour. Even so, it was a great skill that allowed them to be more flexible on the battlefield.
Also, the Skeleton Arcane Hunters could summon Skeleton Beast Companions to assist them in battle.
Currently, they could only summon Skeleton Forest Wolves that served as Bodyguards, as well as Mounts, if necessary, making them very flexible fighters.
With the Mythical Gauntlet in his hand, Orion smashed his fists against the Ground Beetle's head, making it shriek in pain.
Diablo was doing hit and run attacks, wielding his weapon with great mastery. Since his sword strikes were imbued with the Ethereal Element, it bypassed the sturdy defenses of the Ground Beetles, making them feel a world of pain.
Pazuzu smashed his spiked mace on the head of one of the Ground Beetles who managed to break away from their defensive formation, making a sprint towards the residents of Abingdon Town with blood-shot eyes.
After repeated attempts, the Fortress Defender's passive ability activated, which paralyzed the Beetle for a short period of time. Naturally, the Town's Guards, as well as the Skeleton Gang Bangers didn't miss this opportunity and unleashed a concentrated attack on the Beetle's head, targeting its eyes.
Their efforts were not wasted as the Beetle uttered a pain-filled screech as it lost its vision in both eyes.
Zagan, and Lazarus teamed up to devastate their foes with magical bombardments. The Strategist of Lux's Necromancer Covenants called upon Black Lightning Bolts, imbued with the Power of the Abyss, against the Ground Beetles.
Similar to Diablo's ability, Abyss Touch bypassed defenses and dealt direct damage to the Soul. no matter how tough the Ground Beetles were, they weren't able to endure the intense pain that coursed through every fiber of their being.
Lazarus, on the other hand, had the Unique Ability Cold Flames. All of his attacks lowered his enemies' resistances to cold and fire attacks, making them feel the chilling cold of ice, and the burning sensation of blazing flames.
Long exposures to such attacks was enough to drive someone crazy, making the Great Flame Skull a menacing Magical Turret that could unleash deadly spells in quick intervals.
Ishtar was also making things difficult for the Giant Ground Beetles by shooting arrows imbued by Ice Magic, decreasing their mobility and attack speed.
Pietro, who was observing the battle from afar breathed a sigh of relief.
"Fortunately they decided to help us," Pietro muttered. "If not, I don't know how we would be able to live through this."
The battle between the Field Boss Monster and Lux was getting more intense.
Loud explosions reverberated in the surroundings as the Half-Elf unleashed his Draco Meteor Skill, giving the Viscous Carabus Ground Beetle no opportunity to mount an effective counter-offensive against him.

Out of desperation, the Field Boss Monster erected walls of Earth in order to protect itself from Lux's merciless bombardment.
Layers upon Layers of Earth crumbled as Lux, and his clones, continued to unleash their strongest attacks in order to exterminate the Giant Ground Beetle as soon as possible.
Because he was too focused on dealing with the monster in front of him, he didn't notice the scouts of the various Insect-Type Beasts that were watching the battle from afar.
All of them were paying close attention to the battle, as well as the thousands of Humans, who were valuable food resources in their eyes.
