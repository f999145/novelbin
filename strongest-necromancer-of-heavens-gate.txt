 
 When Lux and Cethus returned to Abingdon Town, the townspeople were preparing for the upcoming evacuation. 
 Naturally, some of them didn't want to leave because the town was their birthplace. However, the Guards said that if they didn't want to leave, they would need to fend for themselves when the Monsters attacked. 
 This argument easily convinced them to reconsider their decision to stay. In the end, those who didn't want to leave reluctantly started packing their belongings. 
 They knew that if they stayed in Abingdon Town, all of them would die without the protection of the Town's Guards, whose numbers had decreased to less than half their original size before the Beast Attacks started. 
 "Did the Deimos-Ranked Beast agree to help us?" Pietro asked as soon as Lux landed inside his residence. 
 "No," Lux replied. "He said his ties with Humans died when the former Mayor died. We won't be getting any assistance from him." 
 Pietro was noticeably disappointed after hearing Lux's reply. However, since the Beast refused to help them, there was nothing they could do about it. A Deimos-Ranked Monster wasn't something that they dared to annoy. 
 "Master, we will only be able to leave on the third day" Asmodeus reported. "The chances of us getting attacked during that time is very high." 
 Lux nodded in understanding. 
 Since Asmodeus was the one that took the initiative to talk to him, the Half-Elf was sure that his trusted strategist had already formulated a plan that would allow them to survive the attacks of the Insects that lived in the Shaufell Plains. 
 "It will be difficult, Master," Asmodeus said through telepathy. "Regardless of who we face, casualties are inevitable. I just want you to understand that you can't save everyone." 
 "I understand," Lux replied. "Tell me the plan you have in mind for the evacuation." 
 "Very well. But, it will be best if we add Pietro and the Captain of the Guards in the discussion, so we can coordinate our strategy effectively." 
 "Good idea. Let's make that happen." 
 That night, Lux, Asmodeus, Pietro, and the Captain of the Guards, Marco, discussed the countermeasures that they will take when facing the Insect-Type Beasts. 
 Only when they fully grasped the strategy in their mind did they end their meeting, and retired for the night. 
 —----------- 
 The Next Day… 
 Lux, and the others had a simple breakfast with Pietro. After it ended, the Half-Elf discussed with his group the battle plan for the evacuation. 
 Randolph, Grandma Annie, Laura, and Livia would stay in one group, and they would travel alongside the residents of Abingdon Town to evacuate. 
 Lux and the others would position themselves at the front, the rear, and the middle of the formation, so that they could react right away if any threats were to target the residents during their evacuation. 
 Randolph, and Grandma Annie both understood that the danger they were facing was greater than the one they had faced in Leaf Village. They didn't want to make things difficult for Lux and the others, so they didn't have any objections to the plan. 
 "Regardless of who we face, Ithaqua's role is indispensable," Gerhart commented. "So we need to protect it at all times." 
 Cethus stated "I"ll play that role. Although I am not confident in fighting groups of monsters on my own, I will do my best to prevent any of the Monsters from killing Ithaqua." 
 Lux gave Cethus a brief nod. They were simply stretched too thin to protect everyone. Asmodeus would be guarding the center of procession where Randolph, Grandma Annie, Laura, and Livia would be stationed. 
 Gerhart would be guarding the rear of the formation, while Lux would be at the front. The Town Guards would move in groups, and position themselves accordingly to assist the defense of the Those who weren't riding the wagons, marched alongside them, creating a long line of evacuees. 
 16:43 
 Regardless if they were ordinary people, Apostles, or Initiates, All the men and women who were people when the Monsters attacked. 
 The rest of the third day passed smoothly, and the evacuation procedures were nearly completed. That night, the residents all prayed to the Spirits of the Wanid Kingdom to give them a safe journey to their next destination. 
 They knew that when morning came, all of them would leave Abingdon Town behind. Even though they were reluctant to part, there was nothing they could do about it. 
 Either stay and die, or leave and have a chance of survival. 
 For most people, the choice was easy. As for the rest, they had no choice but to do it. 
 Just as the sun was rising the following morning, the gates of Abingdon Town opened wide. 
 "Forward!" Marco ordered. 
 A dozen Guards accompanied him at the lead of the formation to act as the Vanguard of the evacuation. 
 Half a minute later, wooden wagons, and carriages passed through the gates. The residents had spent the entirety of the second day creating as many wagons as possible for their evacuation. 
 Of course, it was never enough for everyone, so only the women, children, those with disabilities, and the old people were allowed to ride them. 
 Those who weren't riding the wagons, marched alongside them, creating a long line of evacuees. 
 Regardless if they were ordinary people, Apostles, or Initiates, All the men and women who were able to fight carried weapons, and prepared themselves for the battle that they would be fighting soon. 
 None of them were delusional enough to think that they wouldn't get attacked by the Monsters of the Shaufell Plains, so they had already made peace with themselves that they had no choice but to fight. 
 The first few hours of traveling put people on edge. The tension was at an all time high as they traveled the plains at a steady pace. 
 Pietro had estimated that the journey would take ten days due to the sheer numbers of evacuees. 
 Although he may look like an ordinary person in the eyes of others, the newly elected Mayor was actually a Battle Mage at the peak of the Initiate Rank. 
 Battle Mages were proficient in wielding magic, as well as using Magic Staffs, Canes, and Quarterstaff as melee weapons. 
 The Captain of the Guards, Marco, was a Magic Swordsman. Just like Pietro, he was a Peak Initiate. 
 He mostly used his magical powers to enhance his strength, speed, stamina, and vitality, boosting his fighting abilities to the limits. 
 Marco could also coat his sword with the magic of the different elements, allowing him to deal attacks that take advantage of his opponent's elemental weakness. 
 Finally, when the sun was at its peak, the first signs of trouble appeared on the horizon. 
 "Giant Ground Beetles!" Pietro gasped after seeing over twenty ground beetles, who were all Rank 5 Monsters, headed in their direction. "Marco, intercept them!" 
 Among the group of beetles, Lux noticed that one of them was slightly bigger than the rest, and had faint red stripes on its legs. 
 "Field Boss Monster," Lux muttered as he raised his hand to summon his Named Creatures, and his Undead Army to fight alongside the Towns Guards, who had already prepared themselves for the worst case scenario.
Lux knew that this was only the beginning of their journey, and if they couldn't even survive these Giant Ground Beetles then they had no hope of surviving the rest of the Insect-Type Beasts they would encounter along the way.

Lux covered his body with the Favonius Legacy Armor and flew in the air. He would handle the Field Boss Monster, while his subordinates handled the rest.
Summoning his Doppelgangers, he immediately unleashed a Dragon's Breath with the intention of pushing the Giant Ground Beetle backwards.
His priority was the safety of the people. For that to happen, he needed to prevent the Field Boss Monster from nearing the procession of evacuees, who had all stopped in their tracks with grim expressions on their faces.
Eiko, who was sitting on top of Asmodeus' head, wanted to head off into battle, but Lux had asked her to protect Grandma Annie, Laura, and Livia alongside Asmodeus.
The Baby Slime might be a battle junkie, but she cared for the kind grandma, and the two little girls who were taking good care of their own baby slimes, Cora and Nora.
Eiko would not allow them to get hurt, so she simply cheered her Papa on from a distance.
"Pa!"
"Fight!"
"Pa!"
"Fight!"
Asmodeus chuckled as the Baby Slime on top of his head jumped up and down, while calling out to his Master, who was taking on the Field Boss Monster by himself.
With two Doppelgangers by his side, although the enemy was stronger, and more sturdy than he was, the Half-Elf was confident that he would be able to chip away its life little by little.
Magical arrows rained down upon the Giant Ground Beetles, as Lux's newly evolved, Skeleton Arcane Hunters, joined the fray.
Upon clearing the Gate of Conquest, the Skeleton Grand Archers had gotten a free profession upgrade, which made Lux very happy.
The unique abilities of the Skeleton Arcane Hunters was a welcome addition to the Half-Elf's growing Army.
These ranged attackers had the power to imbue their arrows with elemental magic, which allowed them to increase their damage significantly. Not only that, they had the skill, Wild Focus, allowing them to imitate the abilities of certain creatures.
For example, they could imitate the sharp sightedness of Eagles and Hawks, allowing them to see farther and clearer. They could also imitate the agility and dexterity of monkeys, giving them the ability to climb trees and mountains faster.
Of course, these boosts in abilities weren't permanent, and only lasted for half an hour. Even so, it was a great skill that allowed them to be more flexible on the battlefield.
Also, the Skeleton Arcane Hunters could summon Skeleton Beast Companions to assist them in battle.
Currently, they could only summon Skeleton Forest Wolves that served as Bodyguards, as well as Mounts, if necessary, making them very flexible fighters.
With the Mythical Gauntlet in his hand, Orion smashed his fists against the Ground Beetle's head, making it shriek in pain.
Diablo was doing hit and run attacks, wielding his weapon with great mastery. Since his sword strikes were imbued with the Ethereal Element, it bypassed the sturdy defenses of the Ground Beetles, making them feel a world of pain.
Pazuzu smashed his spiked mace on the head of one of the Ground Beetles who managed to break away from their defensive formation, making a sprint towards the residents of Abingdon Town with blood-shot eyes.
After repeated attempts, the Fortress Defender's passive ability activated, which paralyzed the Beetle for a short period of time. Naturally, the Town's Guards, as well as the Skeleton Gang Bangers didn't miss this opportunity and unleashed a concentrated attack on the Beetle's head, targeting its eyes.
Their efforts were not wasted as the Beetle uttered a pain-filled screech as it lost its vision in both eyes.
Zagan, and Lazarus teamed up to devastate their foes with magical bombardments. The Strategist of Lux's Necromancer Covenants called upon Black Lightning Bolts, imbued with the Power of the Abyss, against the Ground Beetles.
Similar to Diablo's ability, Abyss Touch bypassed defenses and dealt direct damage to the Soul. no matter how tough the Ground Beetles were, they weren't able to endure the intense pain that coursed through every fiber of their being.
Lazarus, on the other hand, had the Unique Ability Cold Flames. All of his attacks lowered his enemies' resistances to cold and fire attacks, making them feel the chilling cold of ice, and the burning sensation of blazing flames.
Long exposures to such attacks was enough to drive someone crazy, making the Great Flame Skull a menacing Magical Turret that could unleash deadly spells in quick intervals.
Ishtar was also making things difficult for the Giant Ground Beetles by shooting arrows imbued by Ice Magic, decreasing their mobility and attack speed.
Pietro, who was observing the battle from afar breathed a sigh of relief.
"Fortunately they decided to help us," Pietro muttered. "If not, I don't know how we would be able to live through this."
The battle between the Field Boss Monster and Lux was getting more intense.
Loud explosions reverberated in the surroundings as the Half-Elf unleashed his Draco Meteor Skill, giving the Viscous Carabus Ground Beetle no opportunity to mount an effective counter-offensive against him.
Out of desperation, the Field Boss Monster erected walls of Earth in order to protect itself from Lux's merciless bombardment.
Layers upon Layers of Earth crumbled as Lux, and his clones, continued to unleash their strongest attacks in order to exterminate the Giant Ground Beetle as soon as possible.
Because he was too focused on dealing with the monster in front of him, he didn't notice the scouts of the various Insect-Type Beasts that were watching the battle from afar.
All of them were paying close attention to the battle, as well as the thousands of Humans, who were valuable food resources in their eyes.
Gerhart and Cethus observed the ongoing battles in the distance and were quite surprised by how Lux, his Summons, and the Town's Guards were keeping the Monsters at bay.
Unlike the Half-Elf who was too focused on his battles, the two had sensed the presence of other creatures in the surroundings.
Asmodeus had sensed them as well, but he didn't tell Lux about his discovery right away because his Master was fighting against a dangerous opponent.
Although the Field Boss was unable to effectively mount a counterattack, all of that would change once the Half-Elf concerned himself with the Monsters that were gathering near the evacuees.
"Eiko, summon Boomer and your Slimes," Asmodeus said. "We got company."
The Baby Slime nodded and summoned her subordinates in order to protect the people that they were escorting. Eiko would do everything in her power that was important to her and her Papa.
Even though the scouts of the Ants, Giant Hornets, Mosquitoes, and other Insect-Type Beasts were simply observing from afar, that didn't mean that they were idle. Everything that was happening was reported to their comrades who were back in their respective colonies.
Because of this, Asmodeus, Gerhart, Cethus, Marco, and Pietro prepared themselves for the worst-case scenario. They knew that things could go wrong at any given moment, but the only option left for them was to face these challenges with everything they had.
The residents who were also capable of fighting were holding their weapons in their hands and were also preparing to engage any enemies that would dare to attack them.
Randolph and Grandma Annie also took out their weapons in preparation for the inevitable.
Behind the two little Dwarves, a black coffin hovered above their heads. Lux had set it to automatically summon Sid and Scarlet if the Dwarves' lives were being threatened as a safety precaution.
As if waiting for that cue, a loud buzzing sound came from the North, which momentarily made Lux look away.
The Field Boss didn't miss this opportunity and executed a well-aimed Earth Spike, which sent the Half-Elf spiraling toward the ground after getting a direct hit.
The Half-Elf clutched his chest with his right hand, enduring the pain as his vision locked on a dark swarm in the distance, which was all too familiar to him.
"Asmodeus!" Lux roared as Asmodeus summoned Ithaqua, who immediately conjured a blizzard, coating the surroundings in snow and ice.
Countless mosquitoes blotted the sky with their numbers, making the Half-Elf's skin crawl.
Regardless of Rank, all Mosquito Type Monsters had a passive ability to inflict poison, weakness, and paralysis on the people that they had bitten.
However, if one were to come across a mosquito swarm, suffering status conditions was the least of their problems. It was highly possible that it would only take a few seconds for them to become a dried husk when the Mosquitoes were done sucking up all of their blood.
Countless Obsidian Spite Mosquitoes (Rank 1), Iron-Scaled Torment Mosquitoes (Rank 2), Ruthless Venom Mosquitoes (Rank 3), and Horned Harlequin Mosquitoes (Rank 4) covered the sky like a thick blanket, casting a shadow upon them.
The scariest part about this formation was that three Diabolical Doom Mosquitos (Rank 5 Field Monster) were commanding this deadly army.
Even after Ithaqua summoned a blizzard to cover everyone and to decrease the enemies' field of vision, the Mosquitoes simply hovered outside the blizzard, looking for any gaps that they could break through.
Although they liked to suck blood, Mosquitoes were cold-blooded creatures that didn't like the cold because it made them lethargic. Their body functions slow down and, if they were to be exposed to extreme cold, they could die in a matter of minutes.
Lux, who saw this, managed to breathe a sigh of relief. However, his expression immediately changed when he saw the three Diabolical Doom Mosquito's eyes turned bright red, making the Half-Elf feel as if something bad was going to happen.
 Suddenly, the three Rank 5 Field Boss Monsters, unleashed a barrage of crimson crescent blades, piercing through the cloak of snow and ice, and fly toward Ithaqua's location.
"Not on my watch!" Cethus shouted and immediately unleashed a Dragon Breath, which collided with the Crescent Blades that threatened their Trump Card's life.
The Dragon Breath managed to disperse a few of the Crescent Blades, but not all of them.
"""Breath!"""
Eiko and her clones shouted, and unleashed three Dragon Breaths blocking the Field Boss Monster's attack. However, the four Dragon Breath's attacks combined, managed to temporarily disperse a portion of the blizzard, giving the Mosquito Swarm a path to worm their way in.
"Sh*t!" Cethus cursed loudly as he prepared to unleash another Dragon's Breath. However, firing consecutive Dragon Breaths wasn't an easy matter. At most, he would still need a full minute to recover before he could unleash another wave of attacks.
Just as the Dragon Born was thinking of ways to stop the Mosquito Swarm that had taken a gamble to take down the Creature of Cold White Silence, Ithaqua, a bombardment of Magical Spells and Elemental Imbued Arrows flew towards the incoming Mosquitoes, decimating them at a rapid pace.
The majority of the mosquitoes were Rank 1 and Rank 2 Monsters, so they easily died under the cover fire of the Skeleton Arcane Hunters and the Skeleton Mages which numbered in the hundreds.
All of Lux's and Asmodeus' Skeleton Summons, as well as Rock Golems, were all Rank 4 Monsters, making them superior to the lower-ranking mosquitoes.
However, there was one thing that the mosquitoes had that the Skeleton Army didn't—that was their numbers.
They were simply too many of them!
The Mosquito swarm numbered in the millions, which made things difficult for the defenders.
One of the Diabolical Doom Mosquitoes had also entered the gap in the blizzard and flew straight towards Ithaqua, using his comrades as shields to block all the incoming attacks in front of it.
Left with no other choice, Cethus gritted his teeth as he flew into the air in order to intercept the Rank 5 Field Boss Monster.
"I will support you," Asmodeus stated as he conjured spinning blades that flew around Cethus' body, annihilating all the lower-ranked Mosquitoes who tried to attack him.
With one mighty roar, the Dragon Born opened his mouth and unleashed an acid spray, aiming at the Field Monster's eyes in an attempt to blind it. However, his opponent had very high agility and dexterity, allowing it to dodge Cethus' attack with relative ease.
Before the Dragon Born could even follow up with his attack, the Diabolical Doom Mosquito made a U-Turn and attempted to pierce the Dragon Born's back with its needle-like mouth, aiming for its heart.
However, before it could succeed in its attempt, a crystallized monkey fist smashed the side of its face.
A second later, a loud explosion followed as the Diabolical Doom Mosquito's attack narrowly missed Cethus' body due to Boomer's Dynamite Punch.
"I owe you one, Monkey!" Cethus shouted as he kicked the air, using it as a stepping stone to unleash a dropkick on the Giant Mosquito's head.
His attack connected, but it didn't deal as much damage as he intended. The difference in Ranks allowed the Diabolical Doom Mosquito to survive one of Cethus' full-powered strikes with ease.
As the battle between the Mosquitoes and Lux's allies intensified, another round of collective buzzing sounded, and this time, it came from the West.
Dozens of Red Giant Hornets flew in a formation and were about to join the fray. They only came to the battlefield for one reason and one reason only and that was to capture as many Humans as possible.
Their Queen had tasked them to collect as much food as they could so that she could birth more Red Giant Hornets to further increase their numbers.
Gerhart, who was at the rear of the formation, clicked his tongue as he unsheathed the dagger on his waist.
The Giant Hornets had decided to try their luck at the rear of the procession of evacuees, hoping that they would get less resistance if they did that.
"Here goes nothing…," Gerhart muttered as he summoned a tornado to rotate around his body. The Snow and Ice fused with his attack, creating a tornado of extreme cold and sharpness that could easily shred any Monster that was unlucky enough to get trapped within one of his strongest special attacks.
"Freezing Tempest!" Gerhart roared as he unleashed a tornado imbued with ice in the direction of the Red Giant Hornets that had entered his strike range.
Immediately, the hornets dispersed, but one of them was unlucky enough to get sucked by the spinning tornado of death, which shredded its entire body, leaving deep wounds on the insect's body.
Its wings were also damaged by Gerhart's attack, making it unable to escape the cage of death that trapped it completely.
The green-haired Half-Elf clicked his tongue. He expected to deal greater casualties with his attack, but his opponents' maneuverability exceeded his expectations.
"Everyone, brace yourselves!" one of the Town's Guards shouted as he positioned himself in front of the residents of Abingdon Town.
The other Guards did the same and immediately engaged the Red Giant Wasps that forced themselves inside the blizzard in order to complete their mission of gathering food for their nest.
These Giant Hornets ignored the guards and simply grabbed as many people as they could before flying out of the blizzard as fast as their wings could take them.
Just like the Mosquitoes, they were weak against the cold. However, their bodies were sturdier than the former, so they could withstand the blizzard for a short period of time.
Screams of pain and fear emerged from the residents as their loved ones were taken away from them by force.
Out of desperation, Gerhart unleashed countless Wind Blades at the Giant Hornets, targeting their wings.
He managed to hit some of them, which forced the hateful insects to crash to the ground and get mobbed by the Town's Guards and the residents who had the ability to fight.
Unfortunately, he couldn't save all of them, and dozens of Hornets managed to escape, carrying their prize with them.
Just like the Mosquitoes, the Red Giant Hornets were also accompanied by two Rank 5 Field Boss Monsters, which were called Supreme Dread Hornets.
These Hornets were slightly bigger than the Red Giant Hornets, and their bodies had purple metallic streaks on them, making them look extremely poisonous.
Unlike the other hornets, these two Field Boss Monsters were quite vicious and unleashed dozens of Needle-like spikes, which were coated with poison, at Gerhart, whom they found extremely annoying.
The green-haired Half-Elf had no choice but to defend himself from the combined attack of two Field Bosses, making him unable to help the residents that were being kidnapped right in front of his eyes.
Although all of them had already prepared for the possibility that they would get attacked by several Insects at the same time, they still felt bitter about it when it actually happened.
They were simply stretched too thin!
'This is impossible!' Gerhart cursed internally as he created a tornado in front of him to suck up the poisonous needle strikes that were being aimed at him by the Field Boss Monsters. He then sent them out of the blizzard, attacking the Red Giant Hornets, which caused minimal damage to them.
For some reason, these hornets were immune to the poison of their own kind, so Gerhart's plan to use the enemy's poison against them was rendered useless.
 Lux also understood the hardships that his allies were experiencing at the moment, but there was nothing he could do about it.
After getting injured by the Field Boss Monster's attack, the red-haired Half-Elf no longer worried about the other battlefields and placed all his focus on the enemy in front of him.
He had already decided that even if the mission were to fail, he would make sure that his entire party would survive at all costs.
Although he felt bad for the residents, that was just how things were.
Lux could have summoned Keoza to turn the tide of battle in his favor, but he could only summon the Crystal Dragon one last time.
Because of this, he decided to just use his abilities and save his Trump Card for when his life was truly in danger.
Just as the Half-Elf had successfully incinerated the Viscous Carabus Ground Beetle's tough armor, making it screech in pain, something unexpected happened.
The Blizzard that had covered the surroundings stopped completely, making the Half-Elf pause for a brief moment in the attack that he was about to unleash.
The giant, Wendigo-like creature, who ensured that everyone would be protected from the Mosquito Warms, uttered a pained scream as it fell to the ground.
Asmodeus, who was caught by surprise by the unexpected sneak attack that came from the East, immediately summoned several Bone Walls in order to protect his Summon from being finished off by the monsters that they had dreaded the most.
Lux's face immediately became grim as countless Tetramorium Ants made their appearance.
To make matters worse, it seems that all the Insects had formed an unwritten rule that none of them would be hostile with each other and first target the Humans, whom all of them had labeled as their food supply.
When sardines grouped together, forming a school, they automatically became the greatest fish buffet in the sea.
Several marine creatures such as sharks, seals, penguins, dolphins, and even birds worked together in order to contain these delectable creatures, giving everyone their fair share of food.
That was the current situation in the Shaufell Plains.
Although all of the Insect-Type Monsters didn't get along with each other, they were able to set aside their differences in order to devastate the defenders and further thin out their ranks.
The monsters knew that this was the best way to enjoy the feast of thousands of people, who had left their town in order to escape from the same creatures that were now attacking them from all directions.
The moment Ithaqua fell, the first line of defense against the Mosquito Swarm and the Giant Hornets also crumbled.
Laura and Livia screamed as countless Mosquitoes descended from the sky, heading in their direction.
Grandma Annie immediately stood in front of her two Disciples and unleashed a Fireball, which instantly blew up the Mosquitoes that it hit.
Unfortunately, the number she killed was not even worth mentioning as countless Mosquitoes dived down to drink the blood of the pitiful Humans and Dwarves, who had nowhere to run.
Randolph and Grandma Annie hugged the two little girls and used their bodies in order to shield them from the Insects that were out for their blood.
At that exact moment, a blazing Fire Wall rose up to intercept the mosquitoes, making them all combust like moths attracted to the flame.
A giant shadow passed over the heads of the residents of Abingdon Town, which made all of them gasp in shock.
A giant Termite then landed beside the wooden wagons where the women, children, and old people were. At first, the Guard was planning to attack the Giant Termite. However, Pietro immediately blocked their path and explained to them who the new arrival was.
"Do not attack him!" Pietro shouted. "He is the former mayor's Beast Companion!"
After hearing his explanation, the Town's Guards looked up at the Malevolent Blaze Coned Termite, who ignored them completely.
The Giant Termite had no time to worry about the residents because it was busy sizing up the three Deimos-Ranked Adamantine Tetramorium Ants that were accompanied by lower-ranked Soldier and Worker Ants to feast on the Humans.
Originally, it didn't plan on aiding the Humans because it knew that even if it helped, it would not be able to defeat the Ants, who were its kind's mortal enemy.
Even so, it still came despite knowing that it was a hopeless battle.
Why? Because every time it tried to close its eyes, its friend's final moments appeared inside its mind. Because of this, it was no longer able to sit still and decided to throw caution into the wind and fight the last battle of its life.
"Watch me, Drystan," the Giant Termite said as it coated its entire body with blazing flames. "I'll show you that I can be a Hero, too!"
The Giant Termite didn't want to die, but why did it matter when it no longer had any reason for living? Because of this, he decided to honor his one and only friend's final wish and risk its life in a battle that it had no chance of winning.
"Come!" The Giant Termite emitted a resounding screech as it faced the countless Iron, Steel, and Adamantite Bullets that were as large as cannonballs, to shield the residents of Abingdon Town, whom his friend, Drystan, had protected over the last few years that remained of his life.
Searing hot flames spewed out from the Giant Termite's mouth, melting the attacks of the Ant Army that were aimed in his direction, as well as the residents of Abingdon Town.
For the Ants, it didn't really matter if the humans were dead, or alive when they took them back to their nest. This was why the Deimos-Ranked Adamantine Ants attacked Ithaqua first, dispelling the Blizzard that would slow their advance.
Fortunately, Ithaqua didn't die. However, it still received serious injuries that incapacitated it.
Although the Iron, and Steel balls melted due to the Giant Termite's attack, the three Adamantine Bullets didn't melt completely.
Left with no choice, the Giant Termite used its body to block these three projectiles, protecting the Humans from further harm.
The Giant Termite was more of a Spell Caster, compared to the Ants who were warriors. Although it's health was high because of its rank, its defenses weren't that strong.
The three half-melted Adamantium Bullets collided with its body, creating loud thudding sounds, pushing the Giant Termite back a few meters before it came to a complete stop.
Although it was hurt, it didn't make any sound, and pretended to brush off the damage it received, making the Deimos-Ranked Ants think that their attacks did minimal damage to their nemesis.
The Malevolent Blaze Coned Termite then raised its head to the sky, summoning a Fire Storm, which rained fireballs to the Ant Army.
Due to the Ants' numbers, the Giant Termite didn't need to aim. It was sure that wherever a fireball landed, it would hit something!
Just as it expected, all the Ants below the Deimos Rank were incinerated the moment the fireballs landed on their bodies. Only the Adamantium Ants resisted its attacks.
While the Giant Termite brought down Hell on Earth, the three Deimos-Ranked Ants charged forward. They knew that they had to take out the greatest threat in the battlefield as soon as possible, or else their brethren would all be set on fire.
Seeing his opponents approach it, the Giant Termite gave the Humans behind it a brief glance before opening its wings to fly in the sky.
It couldn't allow the Adamantium Ants to get near the residents of Abingdon Town, or else they would be caught up in the battle between Deimos-Ranked monsters.
The Giant Termite knew that if it engaged the Ants in close combat, it would be the one to suffer. But at this point in time, it had no choice but to do it.
The reason was simple. If the Ants couldn't get to it, they would just target the Humans instead.
The Giant Termite once again unleashed a Fire Breath on the Adamantine Ants before it dove to slam its flaming body against its opponents, just like a Phoenix in flight.
As a Soldier Termite, it was also capable in close combat. However, it still specialized in firing Fire Spells at its opponents.
Unlike the Fire Ants that its colony had faced in the past, the Tetramorium Ants, weren't that resistant to fire. Even the Adamantium Ants, whose entire bodies were covered in Adamantine, weren't too keen on being bathed in the Giant Termite's searing flames.
Shrieks of pain reverberated throughout the battlefield as the lower-ranked Ants blew up one by one.
Left with no choice, they once again bombarded the Giant Termite with their powerful cannonball-like attacks, which created sparks the moment they hit the Giant Termite's body.
After suffering significant damage, the Giant Termite was forced to land on the ground.
But, before that, it made sure to set the ground ablaze with another Fire Breath, creating a space and depriving the hateful Ants that outnumbered it a hundred thousand to one of more of their members.
The Giant Termite created five-meter tall Fire Walls in every direction, blocking the path of the Tetramorium Ants, forcing them to face it head-on.
"Come!" the Giant Termite screeched. "I'll burn you all to a crisp!"
Angered by its taunts, the Ants ignored the Humans and made a beeline towards their mortal enemy, who had already killed thousands of their companions.
Lux and the others understood what the Giant Termite was trying to do, so they intensified their attacks on the opponents they were facing.
Ithaqua, who was still lying on the ground, gave a hoarse, but defiant roar.
A few seconds later, a stronger, and more powerful blizzard buffeted the Mosquitoes who had momentarily lost their momentum after the Giant Termite appeared.
"Ithaqua... you," Asmodeus said as he looked at the Creature of the Cold White Silence. "Very well, I will not waste your sacrifice. I will take one of the enemies' Deimos-Ranked Cores to revive you later."
Ithaqua gave a low chuckle before its body turned into particles of light.
It had sacrificed its life in order to conjure a more powerful Blizzard that covered the battlefield, which shielded its allies from the flying insects, who had tried to take advantage of its injuries.
Just as it had done earlier, a dome of air surrounded the residents, preventing them from getting affected by the abnormal weather change, which had reduced their visibility to zero.
Although those who were riding on the wooden wagons felt anxious, and afraid, the blizzard that was blowing fiercely around them, gave them a sense of security.
It also gave them a feeling of warmth, despite the chilling temperature that prevented the Red Giant Hornets, and the Mosquito Swarm from taking their loved ones away from them.
"Morpheus, make them pay," Asmodeus ordered as he, and his Doppelgangers summoned their Undead Army.
The Death Tyrant's dozen eyes glowed crimson as it released Death Rays, Petrifying Rays, as well as other ray attacks that caused crippling status effects to its enemies.
 In the face of a Death Tyrant, all kinds of healing magic and regeneration magic didn't work. Although it had been with Ithaqua for only a short time, Morpheus got along well with the Giant Skeleton Wendigo, whom it considered as its first friend.
While the Death Tyrant was bombarding the mosquitoes that were hovering outside of the blizzard, Asmodeus' Undead Army made their move in order to take revenge for their fallen comrade, who had passed the torch to their hands.
"The greatest blessing in this world is to live a great life, and die a great death."
These were the words that Drystan once told the Giant Termite when they were adventuring together in the world of Elysium.
 "Not many people are able to do that," Drystan said with a smile. "Most people live mediocre lives, and die mediocre deaths. I pray that I will be able to do something significant in this world, so when I die, there will be people who will remember me."
"I am not a Human, but I will never forget about you, Drystan."
"And I will always remember you. Are you sure you don't want me to give you a name? Termite isn't really a name, you know? It's just what we call your kind."
"Just call me Termite. I don't need a name. I just need a purpose to continue living this life."
"Don't worry, Termite. One day, you will find what you are looking for. When that happens, make sure to hold on to it with everything you have."

One of the Deimos-Ranked Adamantium Ants screeched as the Giant Termite's burning mandibles bit its neck.
The other Deimos-Ranked Ants weren't being idle, and also bit their enemy with great ferocity.
One of them bit the Giant Termite's burning body, while the other bit one of its legs, trying to pull it off completely.
The Giant Termite felt great pain, but it used this pain to fuel the flames that burned fiercely on its body.
'This is the same thing that happened to my comrade back then,' the Giant Termite thought.
Back then, the one, and only Deimos-Ranked Soldier Termite was ganged up on by three Deimos-Ranked Fire Ants, tearing him apart.
'It will not be so easy this time!' The Giant Termite's flames burned brighter than ever before, shooting blazing flames inside the mouths of the two Adamantium Ants that were biting its body.
Their exterior might be hard and resistant to physical and magical attacks, but the insides of their body was a different thing.
The Ant biting the Giant Termite's body immediately let go as the flames dealt serious damage inside its mouth.
Magma-like blood flowed from the bite marks that it had left on the Giant Termite's body.
The other Adamantine Ant, didn't immediately let go of the Giant Termite's leg, and pulled as hard as it could.
A few seconds later, one of the Giant Termite's blazing legs was torn off from its body, making magma-like blood spew from the severed part.
The Ant that the Giant Termite was biting on used all of its strength, and used its head to smash the Ant Termite's underside, making the termite lose its hold on its body.
The next thing that the Ant did was to summon Adamantium Spikes from its body, piercing the Giant Termite's chest, making it scream in pain.
The two other Ants did the same, and gouged the Giant Termite's body, with the Adamantium Spikes that they could use as freely as spears.
They had received significant damage, and suffered internal injuries due to the Giant Termite's flames, so they no longer wanted to bite its body, which made them feel a world of pain.
"""Skeleton Make Bazooka!"""
Three Giant Skeleton Cannonballs descended upon the Adamantine Ants' faces, which made them all screeched in anger.
The Skeleton Cannonballs' damage wasn't what made the Ants stagger and screech in anger.
It was the Abyss Touch that was imbued in Lux's attacks that directly damaged their soul, which made them pull back the spikes that had embedded themselves in the Giant Termite's body.
The Giant Termite, who had just been freed, immediately summoned walls of flames to separate itself from his attackers. It had been enduring all this time, despite the serious injuries it received from fighting three Deimos-Ranked Monsters.
Lux knew that the Giant Termite couldn't fall at this point in time because if it did, no one would be able to fight the three Deimos-Ranked Adamantium Ants. They were already at their limit, and were trying desperately to protect everyone.
Losing the strongest fighter on their side would definitely make them fail their mission, so the Half-Elf prioritized saving the Giant Termite, despite the hardships he was facing at the moment.
Since they couldn't see the people inside the blizzard, the other lower-ranked Ants started to shoot Iron Bullets and Steel Bullets inside the Blizzard. They really couldn't see anything, so they decided to just shoot randomly out of frustration.
Eiko, Asmodeus, and their clones, had erected Bone Walls to protect everyone from the bombardment. They kept on creating more, but they couldn't protect everyone.
Several of the Iron and Steel Bullets managed to hit people, and the wooden wagons, causing casualties and serious injuries to others.
—---------------
< Remaining Number of Residents of Abingdon Town: 2,198 >
—---------------
Lux's frown deepened as the notification sounded inside his head. If the number of residents fell below 1,000, they would immediately fail their mission.
They already had suffered many casualties already, and he knew that the number would only increase the longer the battles went on.
Fortunately, although the Viscous Carabus Ground Beetle's health was halfway gone, it's movements had become incredibly sluggish due to the damage it soul had received from the power of the Abyss.
This was why Abyssal Creatures were very hard to deal with because they didn't need to kill anyone or anything in order to incapacitate them. All they needed to do was damage their target's soul until they no longer had the ability to move their body.
In short, most of the Abyssal Creature's opponents entered a comatose state due to the Soul Damage they received.
The Vicious Carabus Ground Beetle was suffering the same Fate and, right now, it was nearly at its limit.
Even so, Lux didn't want to take any chances, so he and his clones continued to attack the Field Boss Monster until it completely stopped moving.
After making sure that the enemy was no longer a threat to him, and his allies, the Half-Elf didn't bat an eye to leave it behind and attack the Ants, who were mercilessly killing the residents of the town that he wanted to save.
"Everyone, rally to me!" Pietro shouted within the blizzard.
Right now, the Town's Guards, and Lux's allies were trying to protect everyone. However, since the monsters were randomly firing a barrage of attacks at the blizzard, it was very hard for them to protect everyone.
Because of this, Pietro decided to gather everyone into one spot, so that the defenders could effectively protect them. They had already suffered several losses and the cries of pain, sadness, and anger within the blizzard made his heart ache.
The remaining residents were now less than two thousand people, and more died with every passing minute.
All the residents gathered together after hearing their Mayor's shout. Families huddled with each other, while others prayed to the Gods to save them from the Monsters that were out to kill them all.
When all the remaining residents had merged together in one place, Asmodeus, Eiko, and their clones synchronized their Skeleton Make Skill to create a Skeleton Dome to protect the people from further harm.
 For a brief moment, the people sighed in relief after they were enclosed by the protective dome made of bones. However, this relief disappeared when loud cracking sounds were heard as the Ants' Iron and Steel Bullets collided with their shelter.
The Mosquitoes also shot Wind Blades into the Blizzard, hitting the Skeleton Dome relentlessly. Little by little, parts of the dome shattered. But, these places were immediately repaired as Asmodeus, and Eiko, continued to channel their mana to the skeletal structure that was keeping everyone safe.
Outside the raging blizzard, Lux and his clones unleashed countless spinning blades that shredded everything they came in contact with.
His Skeleton Gang Bangers, and Rock Golems were dealing with the remaining Giant Ground Beetles, while his Skeleton Arcane Hunters and Skeleton Mages were helping their Master attack the Tetramorium Ants
Just as everyone was being pushed to their limits, all of them heard a loud buzzing sound coming from the South.
"You have got to be kidding me…," Lux almost cursed out loud after seeing the new threat that was approaching them from behind.
Hundreds of monsters that Lux was all too familiar with were approaching them at a rapid pace.
They were none other than Red-Eyed Terror Mantises, which was one of the low-ranked Alpha Bosses of the Figaro Garden of Leaf Village.
Standing out among them were dozens of Golden-Eyed Crimson Mantises that had given Lux a scare of his life back then.
But, these monsters were nothing compared to the lone, seven-meter tall, Red Mantis that reminded the Half-Elf of how the Red-Eyed Terror Mantis and the Golden-Eyed Crimson Mantis looked when they activated their Berserk Ability.
Lux immediately summoned his Soul Book to identify the new arrivals, and this time, he didn't hold back and cursed out loud.
"F*ck!" The Half-Elf knew then and there that their chances of clearing their mission was now next to impossible.
Just dealing with the current monsters around them already made things extremely difficult for them. Now that a new threat had arrived, he was very tempted to raise his middle finger to the world.

A World Boss Monster was on a different level compared to an Alpha and a Field Boss Monster.
These Monsters' strength was at the peak of their respective Rankings, and it would take at least several Low-Rankers to defeat a Deimos-Ranked World Boss.
Lux had the impression that the Ant Queen of the Tetramorium Ants, as well as the Queen of the Red Giant Hornets might be World Bosses as well. But, these monsters weren't really proficient in fighting.
Their main purpose was to give birth to workers and soldiers, whose role was to provide her with food and protect her from harm.
Although they were hard to kill, their fighting power wasn't that great. They couldn't be compared to the Crimson Berserker Mantis, who was an Apex Predator in the insect world.
With an ear-piercing screech, the Crimson Mantis announced its presence, making all the Monsters shift their attention to it.
Just as Lux was thinking about what to do next, something unexpected happened. The Mosquito Swarm and the Red Giant Hornets immediately retreated.
The Ants, on the other hand, didn't back away and shifted their attention to the approaching Mantises and unleashed a barrage of Iron and Steel Bullets in their direction.
The three Deimos-Ranked Adamantium Ants also stopped attacking the seriously injured Giant Termite, whose flames had grown significantly smaller and weaker after fighting against three Deimos-Ranked opponents at the same time.
Two of the Giant Termite's six legs, and its wings had been torn off from its body. Puddles of magma-like blood pooled under its body. Despite how seriously injured it was, its will to fight didn't decrease, in fact it burned even brighter.
However, its opponents' attention had turned elsewhere, allowing it to catch its breath.
Although the Deimos-Ranked Adamantium Ants managed to give the Giant Termite serious injuries, they weren't unscathed and their bodies were filled with burn marks, despite how hard, and strong their defenses were.
Two of the Adamantium Ants even had black blood flowing out of their body from the bite marks of the Giant Termite, who fought them tooth and nail, despite being outnumbered.
Although the Mosquito Swarm and the Red Giant Hornets had left, and the Ants seemed to be keen on fighting the Mantises, something was telling Lux that they weren't out of danger.
In fact, his gut instincts were telling him that they were in more danger compared to what they faced earlier.
Just as the Half-Elf was thinking of ordering Asmodeus to tell the Mayor, Pietro, that they should use this opportunity to escape, the Crimson Berserker Mantis uttered another screech and slashed its razor sharp claws in front of it, creating a Crimson Wind Blade that annihilated anything it hit.
The Adamantium Ants immediately attacked it with Steel Bullets, but the Giant Crimson Mantis easily avoided it due to its high agility and dexterity.
Its movement was so fast that it managed to close the gap between it, and the three Deimos-Ranked Ants within seconds, catching the three by surprise.
The Crimson Mantis flew past them before soaring towards the sky, flying towards the Red Giant Hornets who had decided to escape from the battlefield.
Suddenly, one of the Adamantium Ants, who were five-meters-tall, collapsed on the ground.
Two of its Adamantium-Coated legs were cut off from its body, spraying black blood in the surroundings.
Lux couldn't believe what he saw because even his full powered strike wouldn't be able to accomplish such a thing.
While the Half-Elf was still trying to understand what just happened, the Crimson Berserker Mantis had already caught up with the Red Giant Hornets and started to cut them all in half.
In just a span of a minute, all of the Red Giant Wasps were dead, including the people that they had carried away to bring back to their nest.
After dealing with the Hornets, the Giant Crimson Mantis made a U-Turn before unleashing dozens of Crimson Blades, which annihilated the Giant Ground Beetles, Skeleton Gang Bangers, as well as the Rock Golems that had been fighting against each other since the battle started.
While this was happening, the Red-Eyed Terror Mantises, and the Golden-Eyed Crimson Mantises, engaged the Mosquito swarm and started a one-sided massacre.
They were led by three Savage Hunter Mantises, which were Rank 5 Field Boss Monsters.
Since the Crimson Berserk Mantis' could bestow its Special Ability, Berserker Fervor, to its allies, all the Mantises' attack power was boosted by 300%. This allowed them to slice through the mosquito swarm like a hot knife cutting through butter, decimating them without mercy.
It was at that moment when Lux realized why his Sixth Sense was screaming for him to escape from the place as far as he could.
Clearly, the Mantises had no intention of letting anyone leave the battlefield. They were Apex Predators who killed for the sake of killing.
As long as they decided to attack, they would not stop until their targets were sliced in half by their razor sharp claws, which were now stained by the blood of the insects that they had killed.
Lux had fought many battles.
Perhaps, two of the scariest encounters he had was the battle against the Abyssal Monster which had attacked White Bridge City in the Kingdom of Gweliven, as well as the Indus Death Worm that he had met in Keoza's Dungeon.
Both times, he felt as if he had no chance of winning against them, and his only option was to escape as fast as he could.
Although the Elemental Tempest that was guarding the Forest of Beginnings was many times stronger than the Crimson Berserk Mantis that had just exterminated all the Red Giant Hornets in the surroundings, Lux didn't feel as if the Elemental Monster planned to kill him.
However, this time, it was different. He knew, with every fiber of his being that the Giant Mantis had no intention of letting anyone leave the battlefield alive.
Perhaps, the Ants knew this as well. So, instead of running away, they held their ground and simply took the initiative to attack the World Boss, whose deadly claws were capable of cutting the hard Adamantium Exoskeleton of the Deimos-Ranked Ants.
"Sh*t...," Lux muttered as a grim expression appeared on his face.
Suddenly, an idea appeared inside his head so he immediately acted on it, not caring if it would succeed or not.
The Half-Elf flew towards the Deimos-Ranked Ants who had taken defensive stances beside their brethren who had lost two of its legs.
"Let's have a ceasefire for now!" Lux shouted as soon as he neared the Ants.
He then pointed at the Giant Crimson Mantis that was looking down at them with disdain from the sky, and made a proposal to the Ants.
"Let's all work together to fight that thing," Lux stated. "If you don't kill it now, there's a chance that it will attack your colony later, and kill your Queen!"
Lux knew that the Ants were loyal to their Queen, and would fight to defend her at all cost.
When he was still in Leaf Village, he accidentally came across Ants who were pacifists in nature. Because of that, he was able to visit their Ant Nest and interact with them on a regular basis.
Although the Tetramorium Ants was a very aggressive species, he hoped that he could find a middle ground, so that all of them could work together.
Unfortunately, for the Ants, the only one they trusted was their own kind. They understood what the Half-Elf was trying to say, but for them, they would never work together with other species to fight their battles for them.
One of the Adamantium-Ranked Ants didn't hesitate and fired an Adamantium Bullet in Lux's direction, forcing the Half-Elf to evade and fly away.
 It was then when the telepathic voice of the Giant Termite reached his ears.
"It's no use talking to these Ants," the Giant Termite said. "What you should do is evacuate this place as fast as you can. I know that you have the ability to do that. The residents of Abingdon Town can no longer be saved. I'm afraid that this is where they will all die."
The Giant Termite then painstakingly tried to prop itself up from the ground as it rekindled the flames that had almost disappeared from its body.
After losing two of its legs, and suffering many serious injuries, it could no longer move from its location. However, it could still unleash its powerful spells, which it hoped would be strong enough to burn the Giant Crimson Mantis' body.
The Giant Crimson Mantis then descended from the sky and flew straight towards the Giant Termite, whose flames covered its entire body.
Knowing that the World Boss planned to get rid of it first, the Giant Termite faced his enemy fearlessly, as it gathered all of its magical energy, preparing to unleash all of its attack spells at the same time.
Immediately, several layers of Fire Wall appeared in front of the Giant Termite, and a giant magic circle appeared in the sky above its head.
"Fire Storm!"
Fireballs rained from the sky, making the temperature in the surroundings rise dramatically. However, the Crimson Berserk Mantis easily avoided these fireballs, as it made its way towards the Giant Termite, who was surrounded by blazing flames.
A few seconds later, the Giant Termite spewed flames from its mouth, passing through the Fire Walls it created.
Lux gasped in surprise because he knew that the Giant Termite had used its skill, Flamethrower. However, the thing that surprised Lux was when the Fire Breath hit the Walls of Fire in front of it.
The flames that the Giant Termite unleashed expanded, doubling its size. But, it didn't end there. The Flamethrower continued to become bigger, and stronger, until it finally hit the Giant Mantis' body, making it screech in pain.
The Giant Crimson Mantis didn't see the attack right away until it was too late because its surroundings were covered in flames.
Truth be told, the Fire Storm, and the Firewall were simply a smokescreen to create a trap that would allow the Giant Termite to hit the World Boss with its strongest attack in its arsenal.
This was the Giant Termite's Trump Card that it had developed over the years, harnessing the power of flames in its surroundings to fuel its attacks, increasing their attack power exponentially.
Even the Deimos-Ranked World Boss wasn't able to shrug off the blazing flames that hit its body dead center.
As if seeing the perfect opportunity to take revenge for their fallen comrades, all of the Deimos-Ranked Ants unleashed a Spiked Adamantium Bullet the size of a wrecking ball.
These deadly giant cannonballs, which were out for blood, flew straight and true at the screeching Giant Crimson Mantis.
Their attacks connected which sent the World Boss skidding hundreds of meters across the ground while its body was still covered in flames.
Just as the Ants were about to fire another round of Steel Bullets at the Giant Mantis, the latter did something unexpected, which made Lux cry out in shock.
In a matter of seconds, the Giant Crimson Mantis disappeared from where it was before reappearing a hundred meters away from the Giant Termite, whose body had already returned to normal.
It had used everything in that last attack, and was already a spent candle. Because of this, its movement, and reaction abilities had almost slowed down to a complete halt, making it unable to defend itself.
Time seemed to slow down as Lux used his Skeleton Make Skill to create a giant spear in an attempt to save the Giant Termite from the screeching Giant Mantis, whose razor sharp claws had turned a deadly crimson hue.
The Giant Mantis had used its skill, Burst Speed, giving it a momentarily boost in speed, propelling it to travel short distances almost instantly for a short period of time.
It was also why fighting against the Giant Mantis was very dangerous because it could appear in its opponent's blindspot at any given time.
Just as Lux was about to throw his Giant Skeletal Spear, the Crimson Berserker Mantis had once again disappeared from its spot, and reappeared a few meters away from the Giant Termite.
With one quick slash of its claws, the Giant Termite's body was cleanly cut in half, giving it no time to scream in pain.
After delivering the attack, the Giant Mantis once again flew into the sky, as if waiting for its Speed Burst ability's cooldown to end.
The upper, and lower part of the Giant Termite's body crashed on the ground, spilling molten blood that melted the ground under it.
Surprisingly, the Giant Termite was not instantly killed by that attack, but the light in its eyes was slowly fading away.
The Giant Mantis no longer paid the dying Giant Termite any attention as it shifted its gaze to the three Adamantium Ants, whom it considered the three creatures that could still threaten it on the battlefield.
"Noooooooo!" Lux shouted as he dispersed the giant skeleton spear that he was about to throw at the Giant Mantis.
Without even looking at the World Boss, the Half-Elf immediately flew towards the direction of the dying creature, who was at death's door.
He knew this was a futile effort on his part because no matter what he did, the Giant Termite's death was assured.
However, for some reason, something compelled him to go to the creature, who had come to lend its hand to them, even though it had already said that it was not going to help.
It was as if someone had pushed him in the back, giving him a strong urge to talk to the Giant Termite one last time before it drew its last breath, and join his one and only friend, Drystan, in the afterlife.
