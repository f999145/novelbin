They entered the end sprint.
Ves personally accompanied the modified prototype to the newly erected testing grounds a fair distance away from the Mech Nursery. He witnessed each test in person and made his own observations about the prototype’s performance.
From what he saw so far, his rifleman mech design performed up to expectations. It weaved nimbly around the obstacle, showing hardly any signs of slowing down. As a fast and nimble medium mech, the prototype demonstrated both speed and resilience.
Even the people who supervised the tests couldn’t help but let out admiring gasps when the prototype finally revealed the power of the chest crystal.
After being hit by a number of laser beams, the crystal started twinkling in white. After the test pilot sent out a command, the chest crystal unleashed a powerful but controlled beam of light with almost the same properties of a conventional crystal, but with a lot more oomph behind its power.
"The beam is at least twice as powerful as a standard laser cannon!"
That wouldn’t change any paradigms anytime soon, but it sounded impressive nonetheless. The capability to unleash a laser beam twice as powerful as a cannon should come as a nasty surprise to the rifleman mech’s opponents.
It was too bad that the crystal couldn’t be charged in any other way than firing lasers at it, not if you wanted to be safe. The crystal also didn’t hold its charge for very long and fizzled out rather quickly, throwing up a lot of excess heat into the vicinity as a result.
"It’s still a gimmick." Carlos noted at the side while Ves engrossed himself in studying the data readouts. "I really don’t see this feature being very useful. Sure, it’s impressive for a mech of that size to be able to unleash a powerful beam, but it won’t have many opportunities to show off that feature. It can only be charged if it’s shot at. Even if it carries a decent amount of armor, I don’t see any mech pilot volunteering to go out in a laser storm."
Ves grunted. "You’re right, but the crystal can be charged in other ways as well. It doesn’t discriminate between sides, so there’s no problem with asking other mechs to shoot at its chest crystal."
"As if anything like that will happen. It’s more efficient if those laser rifleman mechs don’t waste their battery packs on tricks like that."
Ves did not believe it was as straightforward as Carlos made it out to be. He could figure out several potential advantages to pre-charging the central crystal. He did not worry about the center crystal lacking any applications.
Although the crystal technology still hid a lot of secrets, Ves was pleased by the value it added to his design. Perhaps in the future he’d be able to bring out its full strength.
The testing grounds continued to grind away at the prototype. Ves gathered a lot of data on the soundness of its construction and the performance of each of its components. He paid a lot of attention to the targeting system, which turned out to be snappy and responsive, though it wasn’t very accurate at longer ranges.
The further away his mech was from its target, the more effort it had to expend to break past the enemy mech’s ECM. Against skirmishers which specialized in taking out ranged mechs, this effect could become very pronounced.
A skilled enough pilot stopped relying on external aids anyway. AIs and processors always glitched out and failed at the worst possible moments. Mech pilots had been taught to rely on their own skills instead of the comforts provided their mechs.
A mech pilot was there to pilot his mech, not the other way around.
From the fifth day onwards, the testing grounds started to subject the prototype to more demanding tests. This mostly involved subjecting it to extreme conditions. They had to find out if the design delivered all of its promises in terms of survivability.
It was at this time when a very important piece of news spread throughout the Republic. The Mech Corps sent out a formal message to millions of mech designers.
Within the LMC, only Carlos received a notification from the Mech Corps. It arrived in his comm with a special sound that his comm normally never released.
Both Ves and Carlos looked at each other with dismay.
"I knew this would happen." Carlos sighed and raised his comm to read the message. "I’ve been drafted."
Both of them saw it coming, though Ves always hoped that the Mech Corps would somehow overlook his friend. After all, despite graduating as a mech designer, he never did anything of the sort. He had no designs to his name. He didn’t even publish a single virtual mech.
"When do you have to leave?"
"They already booked passage for me. I’m to board the next convoy from Cloudy Curtain to Bentheim. That’s in two days."
"That’s not a lot of time."
"The Mech Corps doesn’t wait for anyone."
Now that the first wave of mech designers got called up, the war would probably enter a heated state very soon. The cautious probes and occasional raids that characterized the majority of the battles between the two sides would make way for harrowing battles in space and on the ground.
Ves accompanied Carlos they went through the paperwork. This ensured that Carlos would seamlessly be able to return to the LMC after his service ended.
"How long do you think the war will drag on?" Carlos asked as they ate a meal in one of the Mech Nursery’s restaurants.
"If it’s the same as the last ones, then it’s going to last for four to six years."
That meant that Carlos might end up a very different man after the Mech Corps released him. The thought of what low-ranking mech designers had to go through during the war freaked him out.
"Hey!" Ves reached out and grasped his friend’s shaking hand. "Working near or at the frontlines can be bad, but it’s also a fantastic learning opportunity! As long as you listen to the chief technicians in charge, you won’t get lost, I promise you."
"Wise words from someone who had seen it all?"
"You can say that."
What he experienced on Groening IV and the Glowing Planet changed his life and built his character. Ves might have encountered a number of close shaves, but he also came out stronger after he conquered every challenge in his way.
Over the course of their dinner, Ves proceeded to tutor Carlos on how to survive his coming tour of service. He enthralled his friend with tales and cautioned him to always watch his back.
"A crisis can happen at any moment. No one will watch out for you when all hell breaks loose. The only person who cares about your safety is yourself and no one else."
Carlos frowned. "Geez. That sounds really pessimistic. Is it really that bad?"
"It depends on where you end up, but even if you are assigned to the rearguard, you shouldn’t relax too much."
"With my background, I don’t have any chance of landing a plushy posting." Carlos said with a rueful smile. "It’s straight to the frontlines for me."
Even Ves didn’t hold out hope for Carlos to be sent somewhere far away. The Mech Corps was not a completely incorruptible institution. Ves grew up long enough among the Larkinsons to hear about how they really worked. When he studied mech design at Rittersberg, he heard other stories that confirmed all those tales.
The truth was that low-ranking mech designers with backing and connections always seemed to end up in the rear. As for mech designers who enjoyed nothing of the sorts, they somehow never ended up more than a stone’s throw away from all of the action.
The only thing that Carlos had going for was that he worked for Ves, who in turn enjoyed a modest amount of backing from a Master Mech Designer.
Still, the connection between Carlos and Master Olson was nonexistent. No one believed that Carlos enjoyed any protection from someone who held an important status in the Friday Coalition. At best, Carlos was an extension of the LMC and Ves.
Despite his great strides in recent times, Ves knew that his prestige hadn’t reach the level where people could recognize him on the streets or where the Mech Corps took special care of him. Carlos had to fend for himself at the frontlines.
"I don’t blame you, Ves. I’m much better off than when I previously worked a dead-end job in quality control. My design skills have improved a lot, and I’ll be able to offer a lot of help to a crew of mech technicians."
Ves nodded reassuringly. "I’ve kept an eye on your progress. At your level, you should be capable of modifying mechs."
Mech technicians couldn’t make any significant modifications to existing mechs without locking them up. Most of the time, they overlooked something critical that led to the emergence of fatal flaws or compatibility issues. Only someone with a mech design background could safely perform major modifications such as adding extra armor to a mech.
"That sounds like a good idea. I can stand out in this way."
"Don’t forget to check in with the chief technician before you do anything drastic. Just because a mech technician tells you something is okay doesn’t mean he knows what he’s talking about."
"You’re always telling me to establish a rapport with the chief technician. Why is he so important? Shouldn’t I be buttering up my superiors?"
"Who’s going to be your superior? Most of the times, it’s another mech designer! It would be great if your boss wants to be chummy with all of his subordinates, but from what I’ve heard, that never happens. Don’t forget that you’re competitors as well!"
Carlos started to get it. "If I perform better than my boss, he’ll probably try to squash me down, is that right?"
"That’s what all the Larkinsons told me back when I was young. The mech pilots seem to view conflicts between mech designer as an amusing distraction. It might be funny to them, but it’s awful if that happens to you."
"What can I do then? Will I have to keep my head down forever? How will I be able to get a promotion out of the frontlines then?"
"That’s where the chief technician comes into play. You see, all those mech designers sent to the bases are there to help with the repair and maintenance of all of the mechs of the Republic. You and all the other mech designers are the guests there. The true person is charge will always be the chief technicians on the base."
Ves made a lot of sense. Carlos nodded like an eager chick as Ves continued his explanation.
"Nothing happens in the mech stables and the workshops without the approval of the chiefs. All of them are career servicemen without exception and have the power to ruin the lives of any mech designer that doesn’t play by the rules. They hold all the actual power there."
"I see! So even if they aren’t all that high up on the totem pole, they’re still more important than the base commander, is that right?"
"For you, yes. Base commanders don’t have any reason to pay attention to you. Chief technicians do. They treat their mechs like their own children and hope that mech designers like you do so as well. In order to earn their acknowledgement, you have to demonstrate that you care."
"Isn’t that a given? I’m a citizen of the Republic, of course I care!"
"Platitudes aren’t enough. My uncle and aunts told me that chief technicians often blow up in front of mech designers who still can’t get over the fact that the Mech Designers took them away from their comfy workshops and plopped them in the middle of a war zone. Even if you want to get out, don’t do it in a way that disrespects he people who fight the good fight."
Ves graced Carlos with many other tips like that. Unlike somehow who had no clue what the Mech Corps wanted with all of these low-ranking mech designers, Ves heard a lot from his uncles and aunts who participated in the last war.
Both sides often targeted each other’s mech technicians. As the war dragged on, the Republic and the Kingdom might experience a shortage in technical personnel. For that reason, the Republic didn’t hesitate to rope in all of the marginal mech designers who barely eked out a career in the private sector.
"Mech designers like you are spares in their eyes."
Too many people tried to make a living as a mech designer. Due to a low barrier of entry combined with substantial capital requirements, most people who graduated with a degree in mech design managed to to get one foot through the door.
That did not mean they immediately became full-fledged mech designers. Getting the other foot through as well took an extraordinary amount of effort. Without talent, wealth or connections, most mech designers turned into overqualified mech technicians or marginal businesspeople who only sold two mechs a year or so.
Obviously, these low-ranking mech designers really didn’t do anything useful, so by and large they wouldn’t be missed if they were pulled out of their current jobs.
Like any state, the Bright Republic faced an abundance of mech designers and a shortage of technical personnel. Using an abundance of one resource to make up for the scarcity in the other made a lot of sense.
The truth was that low-ranking mech designers used up a lot of resources that could have been spent more productively. For example, property prices in Bentheim reached insane levels due to the sheer amount of mech designers setting down their workshops on the same planet.
Bluntly said, without culling them every once in a while, the Bright Republic’s mech industry would eventually turn into a stagnant and lethargic environment.
Due to his upbringing, Ves understood some of the opinions policy makers held towards mech designers. After enlightening Carlos with what he knew, his friend fell silent.
"So they’re treating us as a nuisance, is that right?" He asked.
"It’s not so bad. In the previous wars, many mech designers died, but those who thrived during the chaos went on to reinvigorate their careers after the war. Don’t see it as a burden, but instead, look at it as a precious opportunity to polish your abilities under the most ruthless training program imaginable."
While neither the Bright Republic or the Vesia Kingdom ever admitted it, the Bright-Vesia Wars invigorated the states and ceaselessly improved their military might. The cost was great, but the consumption of less well-performing assets gave ample room for things that worked better.
This applied to both mech pilots and mech designers. States that rarely engaged in war always lost their edge over time as their underlying inefficiencies spread through their ranks like an incurable disease.
"You sure see the bright side in everything." Carlos chuckled. "If you ask any other mech designer, they want to do everything they can to avoid being sent to the frontlines."
While Ves believed in what he said, he mostly wanted to console his friend and shift his mindset to a more productive mindstate.
"That’s the difference between you and the rest. Mech designers should never stop improving their skills. Every challenge is a valuable experience that can enrich your skills and your design philosophy. I hope that by the time you return to the LMC, you can assist me in designing its next mechs."
Carlos immediately perked up. "Is that a promise?!"
Haha! I knew that would catch your attention." Ves smiled and retrieved a small box before passing it to him. "It’s not a promise, but a possibility. As long as you can show you’ve progressed, then the LMC will open its doors to your design input."
That meant a lot to Carlos. He knew more than anyone else how much Ves obsessed over the quality of his products. Ves always took control over the entire design process because he trusted no one else to do a good job.
"What’s in this box?"
"Open it up."
Four shiny pills rested in the box. The glimmered in yellow and it appeared as if they had been shaped by the sun.
"Wow! What are these?"
"They are special pills meant to give you a boost in mental capacity. They’re extremely rare and very hard to get a hold of. It’s already generous for me to supply you with four of them. Make sure to read the instructions carefully and ingest them in the right order."
What Ves gifted Carlos was in fact a handful of Intelligence Attribute Candies. He spent a significant chunk of his limited reserve of DP to acquire four of them at once. The System conveniently tailored them for Carlos too, so there shouldn’t be any incompatibilities.
While Ves wanted to boost Carlos’ Intelligence all the way to 2.0, it would have raised too many flags if that happened.
Increasing his Intelligence by 0.4 should give his friend enough of a boost to unearth his potential during his tour of service without attracting too much attention.
After sending Carlos off, Ves took a brief rest before throwing himself back to work. After the Mech Corps processed the low-ranking mech designers, they would certainly call up the next tier of mech designers. Ves did not have much time left to publish his second original design.
The LMC’s testing grounds never stopped putting the modified prototype to its paces. Day and night the operators worked in shifts to explore the range of capabilities that the rifleman mech offered.
Especially in the last days, the mech continued to get beat up by a combination of physical force and energy attacks. Even then, its frame remarkably held up even as its compressed armor started to peel apart. His second design inherited a portion of the resilience of his first design, which would make it one of the more durable rifleman mechs at this weight class.
Weaknesses still remained. Though the mech could operate for an extensive amount of time with the fuel-based Trailblazer engine, heat management remained an issue during intensive combat.
This was a mech that performed best in low-intensity battles that dragged out over time. It did not excel in short bursts of combat such as duels where mech pilots demanded peak performance and immediate impact out of their mechs.
Ves did not set out to design such a mech in the first place. At its current configuration, his rifleman mechs neatly complimented his Blackbeak offerings. Both mechs fulfilled different roles but could go on the same missions without worrying about a mismatch in capabilities.
As one test operator put it, they shared a very deep bond. "They’re like brothers and sisters."
Ves held an ambitious dream of filling up the LMC’s catalog with an entire family of mechs that all shared the same core traits. However, the coming war and the demands of the Republic put a wrench in his plans. He’d be lucky enough to complete his current design before the Mech Corps called him up.
The issue worried him to such an extent that he broke from his estrangement with his grandfather and sent him a call.
"Ves, this is not a good time for me to speak to you." Benjamin Larkinson answered gruffly as he scratched at his collared neck. "You’re lucky you called me during a recess in a conference. I don’t have much time."
"I just wanted to ask you if you can tell me when the second wave of mech designers are going to be called up. I’m in the middle of finishing my second original design, but I still need a couple of weeks."
His grandfather grumbled underneath his breath. "You know I can’t tell you that. Even if I knew, the Mech Corps will scorch me over a fire if I leak out the date. All I can tell you is that you better hurry up."
After Benjamin hung up, Ves nodded in satisfaction. He knew that his grandfather couldn’t explicitly tell him the date, but he was better off after the call. The hint at the end told him enough.
"I can still make it in time."
The testing grounds accelerated the final tests and brutally treated the prototype like a disposable piece of metals. The mech eventually succumbed under all of the damage, turning most of its internals scrap to be sent for recycling.
Ves gathered all of the data gathered by the testing grounds and used them to spot out any remaining flaws in his current design.
At this stage, he largely smoothed out the major flaws in the designs. Most of the data only indicated that the design contained a number of issues that would be very difficult to resolve. Most of them already consisted of compromises that Ves had made in order to achieve a balance between different priorities.
Swinging one way or the other only solved one problem while making another one worse.
"It’s too difficult to optimize this mech any further."
He only made a small number of tweaks, ones which he was sure wouldn’t affect his mech in an unpredictable way. His focus on haste meant that Ves couldn’t afford to make any additional design choices. A drastic change that affected the integrity of the entire mech demanded the construction of another prototype.
His grandfather told him to hurry up, so where would Ves be able to find the time for another round of tests?
Ves felt rather bad about leaving his design in its current state. It wasn’t quite the perfectly polished machine he was hoping for. Its limited weight and volume capacities combined with the complexity inherent in rifleman mechs meant that his design required a lot more time to perfect.
"I’m running out of time."
Once he reached the point where he no longer found a way to improve his design in a short amount of time, he was ready to enter the final stage.
"It’s time to give you a name." Ves spoke out, addressing both his nearly-complete design and the spirit of the crystal golem resting in his mind.
In the past few months, as he worked to bring his vision into fruition, Ves constantly thought about the appropriate name for his rifleman mech. His heart told him that his second original design required a lofty name to do it justice.
Since he constantly channeled the spirit of the crystal golem when he designed this mech, he came up with a simple but succinct name for his design. It was one which he had been weighing over together with the crystal golem. Eventually, the spirit gave out its stamp of approval.
"From now on, you will be known as the Crystal Lord."
The name not only described the mech, it also harkened back to the roots of the crystal golem which would soon inhabit the design. Ves did not forget about the crystal garden and the corpse of the alien leader which he retrieved from that magical but fallen place.
Something seemed to have changed when he uttered the name. Speaking it out loud somehow infused it with some weight, as if it had gained a life on its own. Ves felt as if he was at the cusp of making history in the field of mech design.
He certainly looked forward to the end product. He had a very good feeling about his second original design. Working with a spirit derived from a powerful being of the past was a very novel experience, and one that would certainly impact the X-Factor in a powerful way.
"Will I finally break into the B grade with the X-Factor?"
He was about to find out. Ves looked around in a conspicuous manner, even though nobody else was present on his private workshop floor.
After scanning his surroundings, he turned to his comm and activated his Privacy Shield before engaging the Superpublish option.

Overall evaluation: The Crystal Lord is a speed-oriented third-class rifleman mech design that, like its knight mech predecessor, excels in lengthy conflicts. The crystal technology embedded into the frame and the rifle of this design is novel and can be an asset to the design in certain circumstances.
[You have received 1,000 Design Points for completing an original design that has no other equivalent.]
[You have received 1,000 Design Points for designing a mech with a substantial presence of X-Factor.]
The System provided a very flattering evaluation of the Crystal Lord compared to its usual conduct. It always graded his designs in comparison with similar models which competed in the same market segment, so Ves always got a good picture on how his designs would fare in the market.
The most important take from the evaluation was that the X-Factor finally broke through the ceiling! This immediately prompted Ves to whoop in excitement.
"I did it! Hahaha! Finally!"
The moment he Superpublished the design, the spirit of the crystal golem finally left his mind and began to inhabit the abruptly improved design. This lifted a huge weight off his chest, allowing Ves to breathe easy for the first time in months. He hadn’t realized how much of a burden the crystal golem represented.
Its mental strength had actually grown by a fair margin! Ves just never realized the change because it happened gradually.
"I hope you enjoy your new home!"
While Ves had no idea what kind of difference it made, it was still a cause for celebration. He looked forward to seeing footage of the mech in battle and see whether its mech pilots drew strength from the X-Factor.
After he got over his jubilation, Ves sobered up and started to study his design from a more sober perspective. What had the Superpublish function accomplished? The System promised that the function would comprehensively improve his design by ten percent.
"What does ten percent actually mean?"
It was like claiming to improve a piece of art by ten percent. How could you quantify the improvement in an objective manner? Was it a straightforward boost in specs, or would the System work in a more indirect manner? Ves was very curious about its methods, so he quickly dove into the results.
He turned his attention back to the evaluation.
"Hm. It’s kind of a muddle, now that I see it. That’s not very great."
While a lot of criteria scored rather high, some of them fell short of his expectations. Even with the power of the Superpublish effect, the System could only do so much to boost the inadequacies that he left in his design.
His design received a lot of scores in the B range, which meant the Crystal Lord performed better than average in those criteria, but not to the extent of becoming a compelling selling point.
His design also came with two very impactful weaknesses that Ves hadn’t fully taken into account before he published his design.
First, the carrying capacity of his mech was rather dismal for its mission profile. Mechs expected to be deployed for many days or weeks needed to carry its own supplies. As big, independent war machines famous for their ability to operate under difficult conditions without excessive requirements, having a rifleman mech that could hardly carry its own supplies was a big demerit.
"It’s like a ship geared to traverse long distances but only having the fuel capacity to complete half of it. There’s a mismatch between possibility and reality."
Still, his customers should be able to get around this problem by passing the burden on mechs with greater carrying capacities. While that sounded like a excuse, it happened all the time with regards to light mechs.
Larger outfits even relied on dedicated transport shuttles or cargo mechs to carry their supplies during deployments.
So while the Crystal Lord’s carrying capacity looked disappointing, it wasn’t anything fatal.
"The cost is another matter."
Despite using up much less expensive compressed armor plating than the Blackbeak, the cost of the Crystal Lord actually surpassed the knight mech. The difficulty in reproducing the crystals embedded in the chest jacked up the price by quite a lot. Once he improved the crystal synthesizer, Ves expected to bring down the cost by a decent amount.
Still, even if he solved this issue, that didn’t mean he wouldn’t be able to charge an affordable price for his rifleman mechs. Even with a hundred percent success rate in producing the crystals, the fact that it gobbled up a lot of pricy exotics added up a hefty amount to the total price tag.
"It’s not cheap to implement these gimmicks." He frowned as he looked at the breakdown of the production cost of a single copy of the Crystal Lord.
The gold label mech with a full-sized chest crystal cost 10 million credits more than a mech that left out this boondoggle.
The cost became much more generous if Ves shrank its size as he planned to do with the bronze and silver label versions of the same model. The extra costs would only amount to 4 to 5 million credits.
The total estimated production cost was hard to determine due to the constant fluctuation in the price of raw materials. For the gold label Crystal Lord, Ves carefully estimated that it cost around 45 to 50 million credits to reproduce a single copy.
Ves couldn’t help but wince when he finished his calculations. "This is already more than the Blackbeak."
Many people would scratch their heads if they saw the difference in costs. Rifleman mechs always cost less than knight mechs. Only rarely would the reverse be true, especially with models that shared so many commonalities with each other.
"Well, the Blackbeak is a basic mech that looks beautiful on its own while the Crystal Lord needs a big fat jewel in order to feel appreciated."
The Blackbeak product line competed in a fairly niche market segment. The competition wasn’t as intense, allowing Ves to focus on its fundamental attributes and rely on them to drive its sales.
The Crystal Lord faced a much more brutal environment. It was not enough to compete on an even playing field. It needed a step up in order to stand out from the dominant models in the market.
Ves relied on several unique advantages to increase the appeal of his Crystal Lords. "The specs, the gimmicks, the X-Factor and my Mastery should all be powerful draws in unison."
He didn’t let his design’s shiny toys distract him from his core goal to deliver a well-performing design.
As the System’s evaluation attested, the performance of his rifleman mech by and large surpassed its equivalents by a modest margin. As Ves called up the Superpublished design and compared it to the pre-published version, he spotted various subtle but ingenious improvements.
"It’s truly worth it to Superpublish this design!"
If he hadn’t gone for this extra step, then he wouldn’t be able to justify the prices he planned to charge for his mech. His own thoughts combined with the consultations he held with the Marketing Department allowed him to come up with a tentative pricing scheme that would slightly put the Blackbeak to shame.
"The bronze label variant should cost 65 million credits while the silver label will still look appealing if I charge 75 million credits for it. As for the gold label Crystal Lord, only a price of 90 million credits will do it justice."
The premium he charged for the bronze label version that the LMC would rely on third-party manufacturers to produce looked very reasonable. It cost a bit more than a Blackbeak, but its performance combined with the value that the gimmicks brought to the table should lead to a brisk amount of sales.
The LMC mass produced the silver label version in-house, therefore they cost a fair bit more. In exchange, buyers would receive a Crystal Lord with the same crystals as the bronze label versions, but activated with the help of the crystal cube.
"Anyone else can reproduce these crystals given time and effort."
When the LMC would inevitably bestow some licensing contracts to a couple of third-party manufacturers, they would receive detailed design schematics that lined out how to create the crystals.
Ves never expected to keep its secrets to himself. Due to the MTA’s enforcement of licensing structures, Ves would still be able to benefit in case some other company pirated his innovations, but that still allowed his competitors to flood the market with imitation models.
Being an innovator meant you had to spend a lot of money and resources to invent something new. While this allowed you to release a product on the market that enabled you to recoup your costs, it also enabled rivals to copy your finished product and release their own versions without those burdens.
"This is why the licensing scheme exists."
The MTA knew that designs could never stay confidential and that competitors constantly stole from each other. The licensing scheme existed to moderate these tendencies and to encourage innovators to keep on inventing new stuff.
To Ves, it didn’t always work, but at least it tried. "It’s better than nothing."
The activated crystals which enjoyed a significant boost in power compared to unactivated crystals allowed the LMC to protect itself against the inevitable outbreak of imitation models.
When those competitors tried to copy what Ves had achieved, they would quickly find out that they lacked an essential ingredient. Without it, their imitations would have no appeal compared to the original models.
Still, despite his many justifications for putting those high price tags on his products, it remained to be seen whether the market could stomach them. In a mech market where most premium rifleman mechs sold for around 40 to 45 million credits, asking buyers to cough up at least fifty percent more money to buy a slightly higher-performing model wasn’t easy.
"It’s up to the Marketing Department from now on."
Unless they convinced consumers that the Crystal Lord of the merits of its features, the LMC wouldn’t be able to charge a fair price. This would definitely be a herculean challenge for his up-and-coming mech company.
"We had a lot of help with the introduction of the Blackbeak. This time, we’re on our own."
The LMC released the Blackbeak with a lot of fanfare because it was his first original design. That was something special and a milestone to any mech designer.
In comparison with the abundant amount of publicity attracted to any debut designs, a second original design from the same mech designer hardly roused any interest. Buyers and publications both considered those kinds of product releases routine.
"It’s going to be hard to attract the attention of a lot of publications and build up hype for the Crystal Lord."
The problem was exacerbated by the fact that Ves might very well be absent at the upcoming press conference that would introduce the model to the galaxy. Right now, Ves had a lot on his plate, and very little time clear it up.
"I best finish the rest of my to-do list."
Ves proceeded to move quickly. In order to pass the MTA’s validation process for each new original mech design, he needed to deliver a physical copy for them. He therefore went up to the fabrication floor and reserved the Dortmund production line for himself.
In the next three days, Ves carefully reproduced a flawless copy of the gold label Crystal Lord. Though he wanted to rush its fabrication, Ves forcefully pushed down his impatience and adhered to a slower pace that minimized the risk of slipping up.
He paid the most attention to synthesizing and activating the two crystals that would accompany the mech. He also capped off the finished product by personally affixing the label and one of Lucky’s best gems in the cockpit of the mech.
When Ves stepped back, he joined the mech technicians standing to the side. They all practically worshipped the first production mech as if it was a god come to life.
What struck Ves the most at this point was that he could feel the impact of its powerful X-Factor in his heart. The mech radiated a sense of pride and threat in equal measure.
Ves could not forget about the alien race’s lamentation for being so small. By fulfilling the dreams of the crystal golem of being put into a massive war machine that towered over most people it would come into touch, it carried a sense of completion that Ves had never encountered before in his other mechs.
The Crystal Lord hadn’t just come to life. It also enjoyed its return to the living.
A lot of publicity accompanied the release of every new original mech design. Throughout the galaxy, millions of different mech models appeared on the market each day. How would consumers be able to make sense of the deluge in new designs?
In practice, due to resource limits, license limits, and regulatory restrictions, most mech models competed solely in the state it originated from. While this cut away most of the competition, it still left Ves with thousands of competing designs that fought over the limited attention span of their potential buyers.
This time, Ves wouldn’t be able to enjoy the advantage of making his debut. Fortunately, the LMC of today was a lot bigger than when he published the Blackbeak design. Back then, he still based his company back at his old, cramped workshop.
Right now, the LMC not only owned three production system, it also expanded its payroll by several times. Many problems that seemed difficult to Ves to solve by himself could easily be handed off to the right departments in the company.
Gavin was his contact person in the Marketing Department, which had been tasked with the challenge of making the Crystal Lord a success. Even before Ves completed his design, the Marketing Department already laid out the groundwork for the upcoming release.
"The MTA will be done with the validation of the Crystal Lord in two weeks or so. How soon can you arrange a press conference to introduce our latest product line to the Republic?"
Gavin quickly referenced a data pad. "We are working with all hands on deck right now. In principle, we can hold the press conference at any time, but we’re still having trouble with inviting a sufficient amount of publications. Some of these news and media empires are really tough customers."
People interested in buying mechs rarely browsed the public catalog and sorted through the huge number of available models. They researched what they wanted on the galactic net and listened to advice from sources of authority.
News portals and mech portals formed a particularly powerful influences that could collectively make or break a new mech model. The key to making the market aware of his new product was to push it to the public consciousness through a combination of promotion and news coverage.
"Now that I’ve published my design, your progress in this area should go much faster, am I right?"
"That’s right! It always helps to have a concrete example to show off!" Gavin eagerly nodded. "I do have to say it’s a really smart idea for you to add such an attention-grabbing gimmick to your latest product. That already makes the Crystal Lord ten times better in terms of marketability."
"Added to that, its premium price point and its similarities to the Blackbeak line should also help with giving the Crystal Lord a boost."
Gavin looked a bit more hesitant at that. "The close relations between the Blackbeak and the Crystal Lord will definitely be an asset, considering that your first design is already so prominent. In the right circumstances, we can definitely enable the Crystal Lord to piggyback off the reputation of the Blackbeak. It’s only..."
"The price?"
"Yes. The price. Even for your vaunted gold label masterpieces, charging 90 million credits is price gouging even to me. Everyone in the Marketing Department is sceptical whether you can get the Crystal Lord to take off with such a greedy price point."
Ves shook his head. "I don’t agree. You have to be aware that the Mech Corps will call up the second wave of mech designers very soon. The number of gold label Crystal Lords on the market will definitely be a fraction of the gold label Blackbeaks currently in existence, and those already have a very magnanimous resale value."
"That resale value trended upwards over time. It’s something that happened organically. You can’t prematurely declare that your next product will instantly be worth the same."
"It’s a high price, but I think it’s more than fair considering what it brings to the table. The Crystal Lord is packed with value. In my opinion, the high price also serves as a symbol of its worth. If I charge any less, then the market won’t take my product as seriously."
"They might not think so highly of the Crystal Lord, but at least they can afford a copy." Gavin retorted.
"If they want a more affordable copy, they can set their sights to the silver and bronze label Crystal Lords. Sure, their chest crystals will only be half the size, but it still retains much of the capabilities of the gold label version."
"Even if they’re a little cheaper, it still won’t be easy to push them into the hands of our customers. Only you would think that there are buyers ready to snap up rifleman mechs valued at 65 and 75 million credits."
"Leaving the gimmicks aside, charging such a price is still reasonable if you think about how I’ve integrated a substantial amount of compressed armor into its design. Most other armored rifleman mechs are only partially clad with the same kind of armor!"
"Alright, enough!" Gavin sighed and rubbed his eyes. "You don’t need to convince me of the appeal of your new design. I just wanted to make you aware that most of the market will react the same as me when they first get to know our new product."
"I’m sure that you already have a plan to address those issues." Ves pointedly stated. He already let the Marketing Department know of the overall specs of his design as soon as he completed his draft design. If they hadn’t figured out how to overcome these issues, then what was Ves paying them for? "All I need to know is is your overall strategy. Do you have anything solid?"
"Well, the Crystal Lord is actually a great product for the spoiled brats segment. Think about it. The models are all expensive high-spec machines with cook gimmicks that make it a natural hit among the rich kids that wants to pilot something distinct."
Ves curled down his mouth. "You mean people like Vincent Ricklin?"
"Exactly so. Laser rifleman mechs are universally popular in the mech market. A lot of potentates default to piloting these kinds of mechs because that’s all they’ve trained for. We found out there’s a decently strong demand for premium rifleman mech models that’s expensive, easy to show off and easy to pilot."
That caused Ves to nod and frown at the same time. "The Crystal Lord definitely fits the first two criteria. As for being easy to pilot, well, according to the test pilots that put the prototype to the test, my design is definitely one of the more difficult rifleman mechs to pilot. I’ve always designed the Crystal Lord to meet the needs of professionals, not the so-called spoiled brats who shy away at the first sight of blood."
He made many design choices that increased the performance of his mech at the cost of adding to the burden of the person in the cockpit.
Mechs designed to be easy to pilot often took a lot of decisions out of the hands of their mech pilots, thereby simplifying the control interface to a manageable level.
This might be acceptable to the casual potentate that never piloted a mech out of simulations, but a skilled mech pilot that relied on his machine to stay alive demanded more control. Through his recent Mastery experience with Alven, Ves learned how important it was for him to be able to fine-tune every possible action made by his mech.
Alven might be a religious nut, but his skill in piloting mechs was very real.
The explanation came as unwelcome news to Gavin. As a norm and someone who never really bought into the mystique of mechs, he wasn’t aware of subtle but impactful details like this. "Oh. That is going to be a problem then. While I’m sure there are a couple of rich kids out there who know what they’re doing, I guess we can’t go through with our original plans."
They continued their discussion for a bit. Ves emphasized that the Crystal Lord fared best when piloted by someone skilled. Just like with the Blackbeak, the Crystal Lord was not a toy to be shown off to friends. Ves designed it to endure the rigors of war, and he was determined to see it thrive in the coming battles.
"Well, there’s one more group who this mech should appeal to." Gavin suddenly remembered something. "All of those gangs and mercenary corps that returned from the Glowing Planet and received their rewards are still flush with money. Although many of them have already placed new orders, it’s impossible for them to run out of money soon. I bet there are a couple of mercenary commanders and gang leaders who are willing to spend a little extra to obtain a prestigious mech."
That sounded like a much better target audience. Ves quickly nodded. "That’s the right approach. You can even approach the Whalers and sound them out if they are interested as well."
After Ves became reassured that the Marketing Department was on the right track, he left them to complete their preparations while Ves returned underground. He couldn’t afford to slack off in what might be his last month with the LMC.
First, he began designing the bronze and silver label variants of the Crystal Lords.
With the Blackbeak line, the different labels mainly resulted in cosmetic differences. Principally, their performance should be equal, though in practice differences in familiarity, skill and equipment resulted in substantial differences in performance.
Ves couldn’t do the same for the Crystal Lord, mainly due to the difficulty of synthesizing and activating the huge chest crystal. Fortunately, Ves already took into account that he might have to downscale the chest crystal, so he easy modified the original design to accommodate much smaller crystals without overhauling the entire schematic. It only took a couple more days for him to verify the soundness of his changes in the simulations.
"I don’t have the time to fabricate a physical copy and test the bronze and silver label variants for real."
He decided to dump the problem on the lap of the Production Department and let them fabricate the variants and bring them to the testing grounds on their own. If nothing surprising happened, both of his variants should be able to pass muster. In that case, the LMC could submit the designs to the MTA for certification before putting them into production.
Due to his impending absence, Ves helplessly delegated a lot of the responsibility of bringing all three labels to the market to his subordinates. Inevitably, the board of directors would have a say in the decision making as well, though Ves planned to ram through a couple of new regulations that curbed their power even further.
Lawyers in the service of the Larkinson Estate drew up much of the LMC’s articles of incorporation. In hindsight, Ves made a mistake by relying on these people to draw up the governance structure for his company. The lawyers made sure that minority shareholders such as the Larkinsons retained a measure of power without being too obvious.
"As much as they’re family, I can’t let them run the LMC in a way that runs counter to its mission."
Ves did not rely on the the Administrative or Legal Department to come up with the amendments. Pretty much everyone who worked there reported to Jake, who in turn was a Larkinson loyalist through and through. Putting them in charge of this matter would be like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse.
Instead, he consulted an external corporate lawyer based out of Bentheim behind the backs of his entire company. With the help of the corporate lawyer’s advice, they managed to formulate some changes that patched the most egregious loopholes in the corporate charter.
In this way, even if Ves wouldn’t be able to attend the board meetings, the rest of the board still wouldn’t be able to decide on things willy nilly.
In order to make sure the LMC wouldn’t be wracked by rudderless leadership, Ves made it so that he could appoint an agent to make decisions on his stead on the board.
The only problem was he needed to appoint someone he could trust with an incredible amount of power. After all, the LMC was a growing multi-billion credit mech manufacturer with bright prospects. It only took one power-hungry madman to topple everything that he built in the past two years.
As Ves tried to wrack his brains for possible candidates, he started to get a headache. "Carlos would have been a perfect agent for me."
He knew his friend inside and out and knew that he didn’t enjoy the backing of anyone else. As someone who benefited hugely under Ves, Carlos could certainly be trusted to value his interests over those of the other Larkinsons.
A significant shortcoming of Carlos was that he never excelled in any of the business courses, so he probably wouldn’t be able to steer the LMC as well as Ves.
Naturally, a bigger problem was that the Mech Corps already snatched Carlos up along with a deluge of other low-ranking mech designers.
After he ended up in the clutches of the military, Ves hadn’t received any word from Carlos since. His friend completely fell off the radar, which was to be expected.
The military took communications with the outside galaxy very seriously. Even taking the time to say hello to your parents through the galactic net could leak out an enormous amount of sensitive data to any eavesdroppers.
Thus, even remotely, Ves could not expect Carlos to be available to act as his agent.
"Who else can I turn to?"
As the temporary chairman of the board, his agent held the power of life and death over the LMC. That was really something that could not be belittled. Ves himself was too busy to revel in the amount of power and wealth at his fingertips, but that did not mean he was unaware of their deathly allure.
He mentally went through several candidates, but he found to his dismay that most of the people he knew shared a connection with the Larkinson Estate. Even Chief Cyril, who knew the most about mechs in the company outside of Ves, never hid his roots as a retainer.
After going through more than a dozen different names, Ves ended up with two possible candidates. Each of them possessed their own merits and shortcomings. If he picked the wrong person, the consequences for the LMC would be very dire.
The first candidate who Ves tentatively took into consideration was Melkor. Although he was a Larkinson as well, his youth and his inexplicable estrangement with the Mech Corps insured he didn’t fell into the established factions of the Family.
"In a way, he’s kind of a failure, or the Larkinsons would have never let go of him to serve as my bodyguard."
Putting Melkor in charge of the board, if only temporarily, would make it clear to the rest of the board that Ves still kept a pulse on what went on there. Melkor’s possessed a firm but understated personality that would likely lead to a restrained atmosphere in the board. After all, from what Ves gathered from his cousin, Melkor brooked no nonsense.
The downside to putting a mech pilot in charge of the board was that Melkor knew nothing about designing mechs or conducting business. He possessed no relevant knowledge that allowed him to make informed decisions, or understand the topics being discussed in the meetings.
Another problem with Melkor was that he would have to put his foot down in front of their grandfather. Despite his job as a military advisor, Benjamin always took the time to be present at the board meetings. As the temporary chairman, Melkor should be able to hold more sway than their grandfather.
"Will Melkor be able to stand up to grandpa, though?"
That was a very pertinent question. Benjamin Larkinson enjoyed a vast amount of prestige in the Larkinson Family. Not only did grandpa work for the influential Ministry of Defense, he also used to be an expert mech pilot. Practically the entire younger generation of the Larkinsons worshipped him as one of their gods.
From what Ves gathered of Melkor, his cousin did not enjoy a close relationship with the rest of the Family. Neither did he seem like someone who revered their grandfather.
Still, Ves always had the sense that Melkor hid a lot about himself to everyone. He never showed anyone his true nature. His habit of wearing a big visor that covered the entire upper half of his face made it extraordinarily difficult to read his expressions.
In the end, Ves could never pin down where Melkor stood. He may be a disaffected Larkinson looking to spread his wings outside of the umbrella of the Family. He might also be hidden Larkinson loyalist who had secretly been assigned to keep an eye on Ves and push him in the right direction once in a while.
"I’ve already entrusted him with some responsibility. What does it hurt to add a little more to his plate?"
Ves already tasked Melkor with leading and expanding the Avatars of Myth. That reminded him to arrange some matters for his personal force as well. He still needed to hear back from Captain Silvestra and make plans for expanding their fleet.
Compared to picking a mech pilot like Melkor, Ves found the alternative to be a little more attractive.
During the early stages of his business, Ves relied on Gavin and Calsie to do a lot of things on his behalf. As the LMC formally came into being and hired hundreds of professionals, the role these two former students played in the company became less and less. That did not mean that Ves had sidelined them entirely.
It was easy for Gavin to adjust change his role. Not only did he let Ves keep tabs on what the Marketing Department was up to, he also acted as his personal assistant in many other areas. If not for his current responsibilities and his strange opinions in some areas, Ves would have no qualms about appointing Gavin as his agent.
"Calsie might be a better choice."
She was a dutiful worker who possessed a deep understanding of the local issues. Ves always relied on her reports on the local situation to keep himself abreast of what went on in Cloudy Curtain.
Ves honed in on her law background. While that didn’t turn her into an expert concerning mechs or business, she should be able to possess a sufficient understanding of the discussions in due time. She also wouldn’t be vulnerable to clever wordplay or dirty tricks.
If Ves put someone like her in charge of the board, then she wouldn’t flinch from anyone, including his grandfather. She would be able to understand very well how much power she held in her hands and how much responsibility Ves had thrust in her. Since she didn’t possess any relationships with the other members of the boar, he could trust her to avoid any favoratism.
"She’s still awfully young though. She’s also related to the Pioneers."
Calsie never hid her inclinations for the Pioneers, and believed that the LMC should seek for ways to collaborate with each other. Ves was not a fan of political entanglement.
He couldn’t forget how the Pioneers revealed their true faces to him long ago.
Even if they turned a new leaf with their change in leadership, a leopard could hardly change its spots.
In this case though, it was not as if Calsie would be in a position to do a lot. It would be really obvious if she changed the direction of the company in a way that favored the Pioneers.
Instead, Ves worried more about her youth and lack of experience. Would she be able to handle the responsibility and stand up to a bunch of professionals who surpassed her in every aspect?
"She doesn’t need to be an expert. She only needs to hold her ground."
To act as his agent meant it would be sufficient for Calsie to understand the broad strokes of every proposal.
Ves decided to go with Calsie instead of Melkor, because he thought that the influence of the Larkinsons was already bad enough. If she subsequently attempted to benefit the Pioneers, then at least they would be able to play as a counterbalancing influence within the internal politics of the company.
He activated his comm and called Calsie to his office. After a moment, she arrived at the top floor of the office and sat down on the other side of the imposing office.
"I have a job for you. I don’t know if you are interested, but how does it sound like to take up the post of temporary chairman of the board?"
He subsequently explained the details of the job and what he expected of his agent. As expected, Calsie looked floored by the responsibility.
"I-I-I’m just a local girl. Boss, this job is way too big for me! I’m not qualified to be the chairman of anything!"
"Nonsense. The job isn’t as hard as it sounds, and since you are taking charge in a temporary capacity, you don’t need to know all the ins and outs. Still, I suggest you study some basic textbooks about mech design and how to run a mech business whenever you’re off-duty. It’s important for you to master the general gist of what goes on in the company."
Ves diminished the daunting nature of what it meant to be his agent by breaking it down into manageable chunks. She only needed to assume a limited amount of responsibilities at the start. Once her knowledge caught up, she could slowly expand the range of decisions she would be able to affect.
Naturally, Ves made it clear that she should never act in a unilateral manner in any proactive decisions. Basically, he wanted Calsie to act as a gatekeeper for every major suggestion proposed by others. Her job was to say no to any ideas that went against his interests.
"If you put it like that, the job doesn’t sound so hard." Calsie’s frown started to ease. "I still don’t get it. Why me? Why not Gavin, or someone else you trust. Am I special in your eyes?"
She looked at him with a mix of bewildered accusation. Ves did not enjoy being stared at in that way, and quickly held up his hands.
"It’s not that I trust you over anybody else, but out of every other candidate, you are the only one I know who doesn’t work directly for anyone else. Your ties with the Pioneers is of little concern to me. You would be the only person on the board who comes from Cloudy Curtain. Maybe all that’s needed to keep the LMC in the right direction is a local touch."
In the end, Ves had to put his faith into Calsie and hope she did not disappoint. To her credit, Calsie did not appear to be duplicitous in her loyalties, and Ves had a good feeling about her. After a little bit more persuasion, Ves managed to get her to agree to become his agent.
As Ves introduced her to her upcoming duties, Calsie quickly frowned when she got her hands on the amendments that Ves was about to propose at the next board meeting. "I can see why you want to close all of these loopholes, but the other directors are going to be pissed."
He shrugged. "I don’t need to care about their opinions."
"Disaffected board members can do a lot of damage, you know. The worst thing that can happen is if they enter into an accord with your enemies or competitors."
"I already thought about that. In exchange for allowing these changes to come to pass, I’ll agree to let the LMC issue a modest amount of dividends. I’ll also throw in some stock to them so that they enjoy a direct benefit."
Bribing people always worked wonders. Ves mainly resorted to this method because he couldn’t think of any other way to keep the board members somewhat on his side. After all, the amendments he was about to suggest would definitely impact their ability to influence the direction of the company.
After wrapping up the matters concerning the board of directors, Ves sent Calsie out of his office and worked through the list of things he needed to arrange.
"I still need to fabricate a couple of gold label Crystal Lords. I still owe a copy to the Oodis Mudriders, while the Avatars of Myth needs a bunch of them as well to form a strong nucleus of mechs."
Ves especially placed a lot of importance on the latter. It would be a shame for his own personal force to rely on inferior silver label products. Due to the growth nature of the X-Factor, it wasn’t efficient for the Avatars of Myth to get accustomed with mechs that Ves intended to replace with superior variants at a later date.
The only problem was that Ves lacked the time to fulfill the needs of a force that numbered at least 40 mechs.
"If I want to meet all of their needs, I’ll have to fabricate at least ten gold label Crystal Lords and several more gold label Blackbeaks."
That sounded impossible to fulfill in a short amount of time. Even if he planned to quickly wrap up his other work and spend the rest of his days as a free man on fabricating the mechs, he shouldn’t expect to finish more than four or five handcrafted mechs.
"The Avatars of Myth will have to make do with what they can get." He shrugged.
Ves had to arrange a lot of stuff before his impending departure. Over the next week, he accomplished a lot of things.
He held a board meeting where he introduced Calsie and rammed through a couple of changes in the corporate chapter.
He kept himself up to date with the Marketing Department’s plan to roll out of the Crystal Lord models.
On some moments, Ves squeezed out the time to visit Lucky. His gem cat meowed weakly at him whenever he visited. It seemed that Lucky still needed a couple of months to get back into shape.
"I’ll be going away soon. According to the regulations of the Mech Corps, I can’t bring any possession along with me. You’ll have to stay behind."
"Meow..."
"Just keep an eye on the Mech Nursery, alright? Hang around Calsie and Melkor if you can, and scare away anyone who issues threats to them. They’re my two most influential agents and I can’t have them succumb to any outside coercion while I’m away.
"Meow."
"I’ll be sure to arrange for a steady supply of choice minerals and exotics. You’ll never starve as long as the LMC exists."
"Meow..."
He hugged and played with Lucky for a couple of times, but he regretfully kept these tender moments brief.
"There’s one more thing I need you to take care of." Ves said and slowly detached his trusty comm from his wrist. He subsequently bound it to Lucky’s neck. The comm’s advanced construction quickly shifted into a locked configuration. "Keep my comm on you at all times, and never let it anyone grab a hold of it. Got it?"
"Meow?"
"Yes, it contains the System."
"Meow!"
"I know, but I don’t have any other choice! The Mech Corps take security very seriously. I heard that any incoming mech designer will be stripped of his possessions and be issued new ones instead. I can’t have this comm falling out of my sight and into someone else’s hands."
This not only applied to his comm, but also his shield generator and all of his anti-grav clothes, which he planned to stash in the vault.
Spending a long time without the System daunted him a little. Ves admitted to himself that he became dependent on having the possibility to spend DP at any time to get out of a fix. Being forced to forgo his safety rope unsettled him more than he thought.
"I couldn’t have made it this far without the System."
On the flipside, this would be a rare moment in time where he could prove that he could make do without the System’s many conveniences. True mech designers built up their careers by themselves. Though many of the successful ones benefited from a lot of outside help, Ves figured that no one enjoyed a leg-up as much as him over the same period of time.
From a talentless hack to a rising young star, Ves owed the System more than he could ever repay. The thought constantly lingered in the back of his mind. One day, a reckoning might come where he may have to pay an awful price.
For now, it was not as if Ves lost a lot of capabilities. It would be impossible for him to earn a lot of DP while he worked for the Mech Corps.
"Added to that, the Crystal Lord is a Superpublished design. In exchange for elevating its quality, I lost the opportunity to earn any DP from its sales."
That would affect him a lot, he knew. The handsome trickle of DP he earned from the Blackbeak alone was very substantial. Once the LMC allocated some of its production capacity to the Crystal Lord, his DP income would be cut in half at the very least.
Therefore, losing access to the System for a time wouldn’t affect him too much. This made it a little easier for Ves to stomach going without this aid.
For now, he made do with a generic comm that contained nothing important.
As he went through his to-do list, he also spoke with Captain Silvestra. She thought highly of the Trieste TRLC-343 light carriers. However, his suggestion to put her in charge of the starship contingent of the Avatars of Myth met a surprising objection from the female captain.
"Thank you for thinking so highly of me, sir, but I’m not qualified to hold a multi-ship command." She replied over the comm. "In both the mercantile and mercenary navies, it’s something of a taboo to thrust a junior captain like me in a position of leadership over multiple fully-fledged ships. It takes decades of training and experience to become a senior captain or fleet commander. They are the only ones competent enough to keep track of multiple vessels and effectively command them in battle."
This posed a problem for Ves. "I don’t know any senior captains and I don’t know a thing about running a fleet. Can you assist Melkor in finding a good and trustworthy senior captain that can crew and run the two Trieste-class light carriers that I’ll be ordering soon?"
"That won’t be a problem." The captain of the Barracuda smiled. "I know a handful of former mentors who may be interested in commanding over a fleet of state-of-the-art light carriers."
The price tags attached to the Trieste-class vessels drained the majority of his personal fortune. In return, the Avatars of Myth gained an incredible amount of capability with regards to interstellar mobility and spaceborn battles.
The two purpose-built ships could not be compared to the deluge of cheap, clunky converted carriers which always risked coming apart at the slightest touch. These consisted of improvised rust buckets converted from outdated cargo haulers that had reached the end of their service. The only reason they had been made space worthy again was because the shipyards replaced the FTL drive and a handful of other essential parts during the conversion process.
Naturally, in the race to offer the cheapest converted carriers, the more dubious shipyards often cut a lot of corners. The amount of accidents these converted carriers suffered each year in the Bright Republic alone could fill up a book.
According to Captain Silvestra, fleet commanders with the right qualifications rarely accepted the invitation of a random mercenary corps to command their ramshackle ships. Attracting the services of these venerable spacers who enjoyed a supreme status in the mercantile and mercenary navies required a lot of effort.
"Hmm." Ves mused. "So will it be difficult for us to attract a qualified commander?"
"There’s no problem at all. They all salivate at the possibility of commanding over two proper light carriers. In addition, working under a mech designer is a cushy job. Unlike working for a mercenary corps, you always seem to have a lot of money to spend, and you don’t go out to dangerous regions nearly as often."
Many mech pilots thought the same. Ves understood her point after he made that connection. "While I’m gone, I’ll be sure to set aside a lot of funds in order to crew and maintain the ships. Just to be sure, every major spending decision needs to be cleared by Melkor. He’ll be having the ultimate say over everything that happens in the Avatars of Myth. Will that be okay?"
She nodded. "Sir, this is nothing unusual. The outfit commander’s words are law. It’s up to us ship drivers to bring his mechs to the right planet at the right time."
It used to be the other way around. Admirals, fleet commanders and ship captains with the power to scorch entire planets used to reign supreme. The so-called ground pounders that formed the landbound contingent of the armed forces often endured mockery and abuse by the elites that ran the warships.
Nowadays, the Age of Mechs placed mech pilots in a position of primacy. Outfits always pushed their mech commanders in a position of leadership. It was unheard of to let a ship captain be a figurehead, even if that person commanded over a starship that was ten times as expensive as all the mechs in the outfit put together.
After his talk with the captain, Ves looked at his schedule and saw that he addressed every pressing issue. The only item on the agenda of importance was the upcoming press conference.
"For now, I should fabricate as much gold label Crystal Lords as possible."
In order to spice up the press conference, Ves planned to bring along a handful of gold label Crystal Lords and auction them after the grand reveal. Just the hint of it would attract a horde of collectors, thereby boosting his new product line’s exposure.
His hard work in elevating the status of his gold label offerings allowed him to cash in on it at this crucial moment. A fair number of mech insiders knew that any product that carried this label would have an extraordinary amount of value. The X-Factor alone helped a lot in reinforcing their emotional impression of his mechs.
"I can always count on collectors being suckers." Ves smirked before he furrowed his brows. "Yet I can’t base my business model around serving their demands."
Milking the cash cows known as collectors required a fertile field for them to feed on. Without building up the status of his regular production models, he had no leg to stand on if he wanted to charge a huge premium for his top-tier mechs.
Therefore, Ves and the Marketing Department did not count on collectors alone to hype the Crystal Lord. They needed to reach their intended market segment which would be responsible for the bulk of their sales.
"We’ve got to find a way to make our value proposition relevant to the private sector."
This was not a matter of delivering a certain amount of performance or including an innovative new gimmick. At the heart of it, mech designers like Ves produced machines of war that aimed to meet the needs of those who relied on them to do their jobs.
What kind of mech pilots did his mech appeal to the most?
The elites. The commanders. The talents. The Crystal Lord wasn’t called a Lord for nothing. Both its price and performance elevated the model past most of its peers. Potential customers ranged from outfits that nurtured promising talents, or mech commanders that wanted to make a bigger impact on the battlefield.
The LMC’s Marketing Department worked with this premise and started priming the local media environment with teaser ads of the new model. With the help of Marcella who knew the market inside and out, they found the best ways to spark some interest in the upcoming press conference.
All of this cost a lot of money, of course. The LMC already lost some cash by issuing dividends, and now it spent even more to fund an advertising campaign for a product that hadn’t even been sold yet.
The increased spending delayed the acquisition of more production lines, but Ves believed his company would be better off in the long run by investing so early in marketing the Crystal Lord.
In the meantime, Ves slaved away his time by churning out mechs after mechs from the Dortmund production line. A constant rotation of mech technicians stood at a distance and observed his every move. They needed to learn how to fabricate a copy of the Crystal Lord on their own after Ves was gone.
Though the Crystal Lord used up less materials than the Blackbeak, its fabrication process was a lot more complex. From the HRF armor to highly intricate mechanisms, this mech required a lot of finesse.
At best, he could complete one Crystal Lord in a little more than two days. Perhaps over time, he and his mech technicians would become more familiar with the process, but the time savings wouldn’t be too much.
"This is a mech that’s difficult to mass produce."
Ves did not consciously design the Crystal Lord to be so troublesome to fabricate. The cramped volume and lack of space reminded him of his troubles with the Caesar Augustus and the Mark II. His vast experience with those two outdated designs taught him how to handle situations like this, but that did not mean his employees could go over these bumps as well.
"Being difficult to produce isn’t necessarily a bad thing. At least it will cut down on the imitations."
Over the course of several weeks, Ves fabricated eight gold label Crystal Lords. Together with the first production model, the LMC would be able to show off nine of them at once at the looming press conference.
A while ago, Ves tentatively settled on holding the press conference in a couple of days. Though the announcement didn’t leave much time for everyone else to arrange their schedules, he believed that a lot of people still planned to attend.
"Interest in our new model is has peaked." Gavin spoke as he reported the matter to Ves in his private office. "The teasers have done their job, but without showing anything more solid than a silhouette, it’s extremely hard to generate new fans."
"We’ll make do with what we have. How many confirmed guests are we talking about?"
"We’ve roped in over two-dozen local publications. None of them are major players, and only a couple of them have state-wide reach."
Ves frowned. "Nothing bigger has shown any interest?"
"No. We tried our best and even offered a substantial amount of bribes, but those huge publications that are followed by people throughout the Komodo Star Sector hardly pay attention to Apprentice Mech Designers. You have to be an extremely talented Journeyman Mech Designer in order to rouse their interests."
Though he found it disappointing, Ves did not expect anything else. It had already been an extremely rare occasion for a publication such as the Rimward Star Herald to do a feature on him. Even that got quickly ignored and buried underneath all of the major news that popped out shortly afterwards.
"Have you gathered any more intelligence about the second wave?"
"According to the latest rumors circulating in the mech industry, the Mech Corps has almost finished settling the first wave of mech designers. They’ll likely call up the second wave early next week."
"Ves tapped his fingers. "Hm. I’ve done what I can in Cloudy Curtain. The Barracuda arrives in orbit tomorrow morning. We’ll depart for Bentheim to prepare for the press conference. Make sure you finish everything that needs to be done on this end before you go."
"Will do, boss!"
As Gavin left his office, Ves contemplated how the LMC would fare in his absence. Right now, a lot of tiny mech workshops and mech boutiques shuttered their doors by the thousands. Hardly a day went by without reading up on the doom and gloom among the tiny mech manufacturers.
These marginal companies only managed to cling onto solvency as long as their only mech designer remained in charge. The sudden absence of a vast majority of of mech designers caused most of these businesses to shutter their doors, sometimes by the founders themselves.
This in turn disrupted plenty of supply chains and caused a deluge of unemployed people who used to work for these small mech manufacturers to end up on the streets.
Fortunately, the LMC remained steady throughout all the turmoil. With two currentgen product lines in its catalog, the company would be able to remain relevant for at least eight more years without any further input by Ves.
"This is a good time for my company to grow and accumulate more wealth."
Unless someone else published a design that competed directly against his mechs, the LMC should be able to sustain a regular cash flow. It mattered little whether Ves published more designs or not. His current two designs already covered a decent swathe of the market.
Ves spent his final day in Cloudy Curtain meeting his people one more time and saying goodbye to them. He even took a shuttle trip downtown and visited Dietrich to get in touch with the Whalers.
Ever since they helped out in repelling the Vesian raiding force, their prestige enjoyed a substantial boost. Their rule over Cloudy Curtain had solidified and couldn’t be shaken anymore.
Dietrich obviously looked like he was having a good time. Ves entered a recently constructed night club that the Whalers had demolished and built from the ground up with all the bells and whistles. It made heavy use of wide-area projectors to cast an illusion of walking among the stars.
The view disoriented Ves somewhat, but he slowly got used to walking in the middle of space. Comets zipped by while stars emitted light and heat. He eventually reached Dietrich who nursed an expensive drink.
"Are you off to join the war?" He asked with a bit of alcohol on his breath.
"In a way. I’ll likely be allocated to a design team."
"I heard about that! My mates tell me that they’ll gather a hundred or so mech designers and put them in a single base in some forgotten corner of the Republic and let you guys sort things out from there."
"It’s not quite as simple as that. Mech designers like me will be joining the existing design teams as extra manpower. They can never have enough mech designers to do all of their grunt work."
Most of the time, people like Ves would be granted the privilege of running loads of simulations or repetitive computations. Some jobs could be left to AIs while other jobs required a lot of creative judgement. Mech design was both an art and a science, after all.
Ves hoped that publishing the Crystal Lord design would enhance his status just enough to avoid the lowest level of grunt work. It remained to be seen whether the Mech Corps took note of his work, but it couldn’t hurt to try.
Ves ordered a light drink and sat on the opposite side of the table to Dietrich, who dismissed his hanger-ons. As Ves enjoyed the imported liquor, he turned to an important topic.
"What’s in store for the Whalers in the next few years? You guys are expanding like crazy. Cloudy Curtain alone won’t be able to hold you all."
"Hahaha!" Dietrich burst into laughter. "It’s that obvious? Well, since you already guessed, there’s no need for me to hide. We’re planning on branching out, but not in the way you think. All the neighboring star systems in the Bentheim region is spoken for. The gangs who occupy these systems all have backers just as troublesome as Monty the Beheader. We can’t just fob them off without provoking a lot of formidable existences."
"So you’re looking for places further ahead?"
"Exactly! Right now, we’re eying a quiet star system that’s closer to Rittersberg than Bentheim, but not too close to make things difficult. You know what everyone is saying about this war. There’s always a chance the Vesians might accomplish the impossible and conquer the Bentheim System. Having a few fallback options ready would be really handy."
"The chance that the Mech Legion actually manages to break through is small. They first have to crack Fort Havensworth before they can even think about moving further inward, That’s never happened before."
Both of them nodded. Neither appeared to seriously entertain the thought of a Vesian upset. Walter’s Whalers only made some preparations in order to calm the nerves of its own people.
"So what are you here for, really? I doubt you visited to sample our drinks."
Ves nodded and put down his half-empty glass. "In truth, I wanted to ask some favors from the Whalers. Basically, I want you guys to watch over the LMC and take care of them if it’s convenient for you guys. I hope you can help my company out again if the Vesians for some reason try to raid the Mech Nursery again."
"That’s difficult for me to promise, you know. We’re in the middle of our transformation. Our combat effectiveness isn’t all that great right now."
"At some point, your rookies will stop being inept. I’m confident the Whalers will become a force to be reckoned with. At that time, I hope you haven’t forgotten about me and my company."
"That won’t happen! You can count on us!"
They subsequently discussed more concrete matters. In exchange for explicit support, the LMC would occasionally supply the Whalers with silver label mechs. Though they could still afford to purchase these mechs at market prices, Dietrich never turned down free stuff, especially mechs of this caliber.
"Great! It’s always troublesome to order a homegrown mech of yours. Sure, we can place our orders to another company, but we’ll only be able to get our hands on the crappy bronze label mechs. Getting them directly from your factory will save us a lot of trouble!"
For the rest of the evening, Dietrich showed him around the newly erected bases erected by the Whalers. Gone was the stink, the rusting walls and overgrown ground. The new bases looked every bit as formidable as the smaller bases maintained by the Mech Corps.
Even if the Vesians returned in greater numbers, the Whalers would still be able to hold them off with these new bases.
The next day, Ves packed his luggage, which wasn’t much, and boarded a shuttle to the temporary spaceport set up just outside of Freslin.
Strictly speaking, with the self-destruction of the old spaceport in Orinoco, Ves did not have to make this detour. He could have chosen to lift off into orbit directly from his doorstep.
It would be bad form to do so, though. Traffic heading up into orbit or down to the surface would become a chaotic mess without a spaceport acting as a central hub. They also played a vital role in inspecting ships and cargo for any untoward surprises.
Only smugglers and other criminals ignored spaceports. If Ves followed suit, he would be painted in the same brush as them. Therefore, Ves endured time being wasted on this side trip.
Once his shuttle finally lifted off into space and docked next to the Barracuda, Ves along with Gavin and a handful of key personnel boarded the corvette and made themselves at home.
"Set course to Bentheim and depart whenever you’re ready."
"Aye aye, sir!" Captain Silvestra responded curtly from the bridge.
Ves headed up to the tiny observation room at the uppermost deck of his ship and looked down on the greyish globe that represented Cloudy Curtain.
He was leaving Lucky, the System, his shield generator, the Vulcaneye and his anti-grav clothes behind. Ves felt awfully vulnerable without these possessions.
Only the Amastendira remained by his side. The System granted Ves the option to store the high-grade laser pistol into his Inventory. Surprisingly, Ves was able to store and retrieve the Amastendira from the Inventory even without the System.
This was very good news to Ves. While he didn’t expect to resort to the weapon at all, he still found it reassuring that he could count on at least one way to get out of a crisis.
The Barracuda quietly engaged her thrusters and joined the convoy of cargo haulers making for the nearest Lagrange point. Among other cargo, they also held eight of his Crystal Lords. The first production model had already reached Bentheim long ago and recently finished its validation trials.
There was no suspense at all. The Crystal Lord design passed with very high marks. The MTA even generously valued its licensing contract at 5 billion bright credits, which was 2 billion more than the Blackbeak!
The high value attached to its licensing contract would certainly help burnish its credentials. Right now, the MTA kept the news confidential to anyone but Ves, but he could certainly imagine everyone’s surprise the moment he revealed the sum.
"I’m not just an average Apprentice Mech Designer anymore." He smirked as he turned away from the view of the shrinking planet.
He already set his sights beyond the Crystal Lord. At this time, Ves thought about the years ahead of him. Mech designers never stopped learning. Getting drafted into a design team shouldn’t be an excuse for him to stop his progression.
"Even without the System, I can still find a way to become a Journeyman Mech Designer."
With his abundant amount of Skills, Ves more than satisfied the knowledge requirement to advance to Journeyman.
The other two requirements set him back. He lacked experience in designing original mechs and he was still in the process of developing his design philosophy.
In a way, Ves could still work on those two requirements as part of a design team, but he could only do so if he was entrusted with greater responsibility.
"Mindless work won’t cut it for me. I’ve got to be in a position where I can truly contribute to the designs in development."
Ves already imagined the challenges he would face. With Senior Mech Designers calling the shots, a junior like him possessed no status at all. Right from the start, he faced an uphill battle trying to earn everyone’s acknowledgement.
"I’ll see how I can proceed once I get there. I can’t completely rely on second-hand stories to form my plan. I have to see how a design team is run with my own two eyes."
Once they arrived at Bentheim, Ves and the people he brought along went to work. They booked one of the better convention halls in the center of Dorum to hold their second product this time.
It took a lot of effort to secure a booking on short notice. Coincidentally, a mech manufacturer that previously booked in the same period had shuttered its doors due to recent events.
"The ongoing war is making a lot of people concerned." Marcella explained as she met with Ves at the entrance of the enormous hall. "Business is going well for now, but a lot of influential people have started moving away from Bentheim."
That meant less customers and less demand. Ves hummed at the news. "Hm. Will it affect our opening?"
"You’ll be seeing a lot less movers and shakers in the crowd. Instead, they’re sending out their representatives. Therefore, take note in your presentation to who you are talking to. To reach the people holding all the money, you have to appeal to them through their reps."
The recent raids by the 3rd Imodris Legion terrified the entire Bentheim region. Magnates and wealthy families that contemplated moving out all pulled the trigger and left the volatile planet behind. This reordered the local power structure and disordered the local economy even further.
Still, despite all the doom and gloom pervading throughout the streets, life went on, and so did the mech industry. Press conferences continued to be held all the time for the mech designers that remained to introduce their new designs.
Not every mech designer got called up to serve. The Bright Republic knew that they would cripple their entire domestic mech industry if they did so. In general, they left aside those who contributed enormously on their own and those who already served in the previous wars.
Thus, even if most of the younger generation of mech designers disappeared from the market, the mech industry as a whole would still be able to stay aloft.
As they toured the empty hall, Marcella began to explain the recent situation. "This is a time of war. Though most of the news is kept from the public, the Republic is extremely concerned about Lady Amalia’s legion. She hasn’t shown up since the raids and that’s a huge concern. The threat she poses is a lot more damaging to our confidence than actually showing up to attack a star system."
"In other words, she’s hanging the 3rd Imodris Legion over our heads like a sword of Damocles?"
"Exactly so. Some mech manufacturers are thinking of winding down, while others are starting to stockpile rare resources. Prices have gone up by ten percent since the raids."
This was only the start. As the war progressed, prices would continue to skyrocket, bankrupting over half of the mech manufacturers based in the Bright Republic. This happened in the previous war and the wars before that. Ves knew that his company was in better shape than most. He deliberately set a high profit margin on his products in order to absorb a substantial spike in costs.
He could afford to do so because the LMC exclusively produced premium mechs. Though Ves recently developed an ambition to enter into the ultra-cheap bulk mech market, he wouldn’t be able to keep up with the razor-thin margins as of yet. His company wasn’t geared to compete on that level yet.
They finished touring the hall and Ves nodded in satisfaction at the open spaces. A high-end convention hall like this not only provided ample space to show off multiple mechs, it even offered a small-scale arena space to show off the live combat capabilities of their mechs.
Gavin met the pair near the arena. "Boss! This arena doesn’t offer a lot of space, but the security screens are powerful enough to endure a full-powered blast from the Crystal Lord’s chest laser! Why don’t we hold a live duel?"
"A duel isn’t the best way to showcase the Crystal Lord’s strengths." Marcella retorted. "Just like the Blackbeak, the Crystal Lord is a mech that excels in battles of attrition. Let’s not repeat the near-disastrous design duel that happened last time. The stakes are higher now."
The mech broker had a point. Laser rifleman mechs and the Crystal Lord in particular only showed their true value if they had time to wear down their opponents. Besides that, the arena barely provided a ranged mech like the Crystal Lord enough space to show off its mobility.
"This is the downside to booking a convention hall in the middle of the city. There are other halls in the outskirts that offer much more room to maneuver."
"Hm, what’s done is done. We’ll have a lot more trouble trying to attract people to attend our product reveal if we held it in the outskirts."
They decided not to display the prowess of their mechs in a duel. Instead, they planned to show off some of the features of the Crystal Lord through target practice and live demonstrations. The arena offered just enough space to do so safely.
Throughout the rest of the planning sessions, they also formulated how to conduct the rest of their product reveal. They needed to awe the crowd in more ways than one in order to justify the sticker price of their mechs.
Marcella laid out their priorities. "Our main job is to convince the crowd that the Crystal Lord brings enough value to the table to make the prices seem reasonable. Forget about the pricing schemes for the silver and gold label mechs, the 65 million base price for the bronze label Crystal Lords will definitely be met with ridicule."
Getting laughed at would be the worst thing that Ves could face in the upcoming press conference. He worked hard to earn some credibility in the business. Botching this presentation would ruin all that he worked for and land the LMC in a difficult position.
As they drew up some concepts and brainstormed some ideas to illustrate the Crystal Lord’s appeal, a siren started to ring outside the streets. Their comms quickly started beeping in unison.
"It’s an alert!"
"Are we under attack?!" Ves quickly asked.
"No." Marcella quickly shook her head. She was much more familiar with the local sirens than Gavin and Ves. "This is the secondary alert. It means that a star system nearby is being attacked at this very moment. The sirens are meant to bring us up to readiness in case the attack spills over to the Bentheim System."
Everyone turned grim at the news. "Is it the 3rd Imodris Legion?"
They all checked the news on their comms. "Information is scarce. The Republic is keeping a tight lid on the news. All they are saying is that the Coscos System is facing the combined might of two spaceborn mech regiments."
"The Coscos System!" Ves uttered in shock. "Isn’t that the place where most of the high-grade fuels are refined?"
Marcella nodded. "It hosts a vital strategic fuel refinery works that processes the rare materials from several rich gas giants. It’s essential to the Mech Corps and they are usually guarding it tightly."
"Perhaps. But will it be enough to repel two Vesian spaceborn mech regiments at once? And what is the rest of the 3rd Imodris Legion doing?"
The worst possible news could be that this might all be a distraction for a larger move. This was why Bentheim sounded out those sirens. The authorities tasked with guarding them didn’t have a clue where the Vesians struck next.
"Don’t fret too much, Ves. The Vesians don’t have the numbers to threaten Bentheim. The odds of an attack here is rather minimal. Without spaceborn mechs, the remainder of the legion can only strike lightly-defended planets with only a basic garrison of spaceborn mechs."
Ves already knew that. He fretted not because he thought that Cloudy Curtain happened to form one of those lightly defended systems. If Lady Amalia chose to do so, she could easily send out an entire regiment to overwhelm the rural planet’s feeble mechs and turn all of its industries into ash and smoke.
The only reason why he hadn’t fallen into a full-blown panic was because he knew that Cloudy Curtain was too small-time for the Vesians to bother to commit to such an attack. It didn’t make too much sense to risk an attack on a planet that hosted only a single medium mech manufacturer.
They spent a couple of hours in relative silence. Ves and the rest of the workers continued to plan out their press conference, but they toned down some of the fanfare. It would be in poor taste to hold an upbeat press conference right after a major attack.
News began to trickle out after more than half a day of silence. The Vesians had been repelled, but some of the refinery complexes that orbited the gas giant suffered grievous damage.
The Mech Corps muffled everything else. No one knew how many refineries sustained damage and whether the Republic could salvage them in a short amount of time.
Though the Bright Republic sourced its fuels from many sources, the Coscos System happened to be one of the biggest and most developed site due to its proximity to the Bentheim System. Crippling it would certainly disrupt the supply of fuels to mechs and ships.
This was bad news for Ves and the LMC, as both of their product lines ran on fuel instead of energy cells.
"The demand for fuel-based mechs won’t collapse overnight." Marcella consoled Ves. "It might be a little more difficult than usual to convince buyers to opt for your mechs, but this is a temporary condition."
The Bright Republic wasn’t stupid. Even though it invested heavily in the refineries at the Coscos System, they established many smaller refineries in other star systems. Furthermore, they also spent a substantial sum to import them from states blessed with an abundance of fuels.
Ves kept up with the news even after they finished the planning session. At night, he stayed up late browsing the news portals for any scrap of information they could squeeze out.
The news sounded pretty bad, but at least it hadn’t gone worse. The Bright Republic estimated it could bring back its refineries to full capacity within half a year. Of course, this only held up if the Vesians didn’t attempt to strike them again.
In order to guard against another attack, the Mech Corps quietly considered whether they should allocate some of their forces to the Coscos System.
Through news like this, Ves understood what the 3rd Imodris Legion was really after. "They weren’t serious in destroying the fuel refineries at Coscos. They want to exploit the current shortcomings in the defensive strategy opted by the Mech Corps."
This wasn’t anything complicated. The Mech Corps could never spare the mechs and manpower to defend every desolate star system that fell within the Republic’s borders. Instead, they chose to concentrate their mech regiments in a handful strategic star system, and deployed some of their forces to reinforce a nearby star system that fell under attack.
There was much to be criticized about this lackluster strategy. Though well-defending systems like Bentheim enjoyed an abundance of protection, many other star systems like Cloudy Curtain needed to rely on gangs or a handful of volunteer militia to keep out the troublemakers.
Reinforcements often came late or not at all. In the previous wars, many star systems burned due to the lacking response of the Mech Corps.
Still, as bad as it sounded, adopting other strategies would inevitably lead to worse outcomes. The danger of spreading out forces increased the odds of letting them be defeated in detail. It would be trivially easy for the Vesians to concentrate their invasion fleets and stomp the inadequately defended star systems one by one.
The Mech Corps constantly grappled with this recurring dilemma, and even though they sustained a lot of criticism over the years, they never budged from their stance.
It was not as if they resigned themselves to be a punching bag. During the previous wars, they sometimes raided the Vesian star systems in return, thereby exploiting the same gaps in their defenses.
Still, that had nothing to do with him. All Ves should be concerned about at this moment was to find a way to push his product onto the market.
"In two days, the market will get to know of my new product."
On the day the LMC unveiled the Crystal Lord design, the tense situation in the Coscos System cast a shadow over Bentheim. Underneath the grey, overcast streets of Dorum, fewer people walked by as everyone worried about their jobs, their safety, and whether the Republic could repel the Vesians yet again.
Ves looked down on the streets from Marcella’s office.
"The public is getting more uncertain these days." He spoke. "The Bright Republic fought against the Vesia Kingdom for how many times? And never have we succumbed to their onslaught."
"There’s always a fluke. The Vesians might have called up an ally, or the Mech Corps may have screwed up at some point. You know the Vesian nobles keep trying to invade the Republic because they hope they’ll eventually get it right and blow past our defenses."
That was the awful thing about living in a state entangled in a generational war. The only reason why the Vesians haven’t permanently instituted a state of war against the Brighters was because they didn’t have the resources to sustain their aggression.
"Did you fight in the previous war?" Ves suddenly asked. "You obviously haven’t started out as a mech broker."
The woman shrugged. She softly caressed her artificial limb. "I took part in the previous war, aye. It’s not a pleasant experience and I don’t really want to talk about it. I was too young back then. Young and stupid. I still needed five more years to graduate from the mech academy, but the Republic instituted accelerated training programs that attempted to cram everything we needed to learn into a span of only two years."
Ves understood. When the war dragged on and pilots began to grow scarce, the Republic tended to scrape up the young and the old.
These days, it took eight years to turn a fresh potentate into a barebones mech pilot, but they could barely pilot an industrial mech in the basic academies.
In order to gain more advanced fighting skills, the mech cadets also needed to spend some years at an advanced academy. The most well-rounded programs often ran for six years. Therefore, the best and most qualified graduates spent at least fourteen precious years in the academies.
They not only learned how to pilot a mech, but also how to work as a team and how to kill an enemy mech. At the advanced academies, they stopped learning the basics of each mech archetype but chose to specialize in a single role to their utmost.
Practically every state in the human-dominated parts of the galaxy adopted this mech training model. It originated from the galactic center where first-class mechs would also be extremely complex to pilot, but it spread out to the rest of the galaxy as academies in poorer star sectors lacked the resources to provide effective teaching.
Marcella continued her story. "In truth, I only experienced the end of the last war. They put a handful of prematurely graduated mech pilots like me into battle-scarred units where the only mech pilots who survived are those who are the toughest and most resilient men and women I have ever met."
"Did you enjoy your time with them?"
"I sure did. Most of my friendships today can be traced back to my service time. Those who survived formed a bond. We fought and watched each other’s back even as missiles rained down on us and took out a hapless colleague. They taught us not to blink and keep on marching forward."
"Your luck must have ran out at some point."
"Yup. It happens to the best of us. The war began to wind down at that stage. The planet we fought over was bombed to hell and back. There was hardly any area in sight where the soil hasn’t been disturbed by passing mechs or spent ordnance. Just when I thought I could make it through the end, the Vesians pulled off their final offenses. I barely got into the cockpit of my mech before a surprise attack punched right through the chest of my machine. That was the closest to death I’ve ever been."
Ves could imagine the horror of getting your cockpit breached by a mech-scaled weapon. "You survived, obviously."
"I was one of the lucky ones. Supplies ran short and the doctors became overwhelmed by the sheer amount of wounded that poured into their treatment facilities. Did you know that mechs are horribly lethal? Anyone facing a mech directly in battle will rarely get away unscathed unless they have their own mechs. It takes many tons of armor to endure a casual attack by a mech."
Both of them fell silent after that. As a young man who never experienced the previous war, he only heard about its horrors from the second-hand stories his aunts and uncles were fond of repeating.
Naturally, most young kids at that age hardly understood the cynicism acting as an undercurrent to their tales. Kids like Ves only focused on the glory and heroics of piloting mechs.
Now that he grew older, Ves felt a little more ambivalent about war. He disliked it, but as someone who designed and sold mechs for a living, his entire business model revolved around conflict.
Without war, who needed mechs?
"Sounds like it hasn’t been a pleasant experience for you. Why did you enter the mech broker business then?"
"Well, my ability to pilot a mech has fritzed up due to the wounds I suffered back then. Due to the backlog of wounded, by the time a medical bot arrived at my side, I lost the opportunity to regrow my arm. I didn’t understand the weird the science stuff the stupid bot spoke out, but I knew by then that more than ten years of my life is wasted. Think about it. What was I supposed to do with all my years of learning how to pilot mechs?"
"So you continued to get involved with mechs, just in a different way."
Marcella nodded. "After the war, everyone tried their best to forget what happened. The new generation of mechs swept through the galaxy and people needed to make sense of the new designs that rolled out of the mech factories. That’s where people like me come in. Just because I can’t pilot them anymore doesn’t mean my mind has turned stupid. I studied under a mentor at first. I learned all of my business acumen from him. After that, I branched out on my own."
"Mechs have a way of persisting." Ves remarked with a rueful smile. "Now that I think about it, there are many possible careers for veterans such as you to pursue. There is still life after war."
"A lot of mechs get trashed after the war. Salvagers eagerly strip the battlefields and recycle them down into usable resources. Together with the onset of the new generation of mechs, everyone wants better mechs. It’s become somewhat of a clockwork pattern for us."
"Ah?" Ves picked up a doubtful tone in her voice.
"It’s as if there is a conspiracy behind it all. There’s this thing called the military-industrial complex. You heard of it, right?"
"Sure I did, but people always tell me there’s no truth behind it. The military-industrial complex is a silly conspiracy theory!"
"Are you sure about that?" Marcella pointedly asked. "You might be thinking that you’ve joined the big boys now that your mechs sell by the hundreds every month, but you’re still a small-time player to the true rulers of the Republic."
"Even if they exist, it’s not as if they can do anything about the Vesians. At the heart of it, it’s the Vesians who are constantly prodding for war."
Marcella pointed her finger at him. "That’s because their version of the military-industrial complex is a lot more simpler than ours. They don’t even bother to hide in the shadows. What do you think those greedy nobles are really after? Do they want to help the royal family conquer the Bentheim System? Hah! Even if they lost millions of men and many thousands of mechs, they still accomplished their goals! The Vesians aren’t out to conquer our territory in the first place!"
That came as something of a surprise to Ves. For what reason drove the Vesians into such a persistent pattern of war against the Republic? "What’s their true goals then."
"They want to cling onto their power! Just think about it. Without war, how much of our populations would explode over time? Every planet would become an unlivable mess after a hundred years or so of uninterrupted growth. Even with the boundless amount of planets in the galaxy, it’s too expensive to settle them all!"
What Marcella said sounded vaguely familiar to Ves. "Isn’t this one of the justifications people bandy about when they question the MTA and CFA’s role as protectors of the human race?"
As the two most powerful trans-galactic organizations, they potentially held the power to end all internal conflicts throughout human-occupied territories.
However, just because they held the power to stop all wars didn’t mean it was a good idea to do so. From what Ves heard about the two powerful organizations, they lacked the confidence to impose a unified human order over so many star sectors.
"Is the MTA and CFA in on it?" Ves asked.
"Sure! Why not? They know as well as we do that too many humans are born each years. By the time I end this sentence, another billion or trillion or so babies are born right at this moment. The other alien races liken us as locusts who only know how to reproduce, and I can say they hit the nail on the head. With the growth rates maintained by every state, it’s inevitable for planets to become cramped."
"Therefore, states needed to engage in war in order to cull their population?"
It sounded excessively brutal and needlessly convoluted to Ves. "Why not lower the birth rate?"
"Haha!" Marcella laughed. "That’s easy to do, but would any state want to? It’s fiendishly difficult to crank up the growth rate after generations of cultural brainwashing. And besides, it doesn’t help if only a single state institute these kinds of restrictions. Their neighbors will quickly swell in population and manpower and treat them like a poor and easily exploitable territory."
"How does this relate to the so-called military-industrial complex?"
"Well, the most powerful authorities of our race have collectively decided that mechs are good and need to be spread as far as possible. Wars between states form the most convenient way to sell a lot of mechs, and curb the excessive growth in people as well! This exists in every layer of human society, from the galactic level to the level of an individual state. No matter how big of a scale the complex turns out to be, they all want to profit out of death and misery."
It sounded like villainous aspiration, but Ves felt like they made the right decision. The top influences that held sway over human society reigned the fate of their entire race. They could not be soft-hearted nor show any weaknesses to the aliens that lingered at their borders.
The military-industrial complex actually sounded like a bunch of people that Ves could get along with. Where could he sign up?
Marcella read the look in his eyes and signed in disappointment. "You’re a mech designer, so of course you take their side. All I can say is that you’ll definitely change your tune by the end of this war. It’s going to be a very long slog and there will be plenty of times when you get to witness the devastating consequences of war."
"I’m not a sheltered person, you know. I’ve witnessed first-hand how far a battle can go. I’m also a Larkinson. I’ve heard many tales about the previous wars."
Ves and Marcella didn’t quite see eye to eye on this issue. Mechs gained prominence over four-hundred years ago and would continue to be relevant for centuries to come. Designing mechs and selling them was a noble profession in these times.
"When you step up to the podium this afternoon and show off your new creation, think about what you are introducing to the market. Will your mech be used to destroy, or to defend? You are responsible for how your war machines will be put to use. The blood that your customers are spilling with the help of your creations will inevitably stain your own hands."
Ves tried hard not to think too much about the misuses of his products. Ever since Vincent Ricklin took his Marc Antony Mark I and laid waste to the upper echelon of his own family, Ves stopped paying attention to what his customers did with his mechs.
He only provided the mechs to those that needed it. His responsibility for his mechs ended as soon as they arrived in the hands of his customers.
"I think the crowd will eagerly wish to own a copy my new mech."
Ves left Marella’s office and boarded an armored shuttle that conveyed him towards the convention hall. Along the way, he tried but couldn’t quite get Marcella’s words to disappear from his mind.
On a whim, he activated his comm and performed a few casual searches on the galactic net.
The cursory search revealed a statistic that Ves had always overlooked. "Casualties as a result of collateral damage?"
He knew what collateral damage meant. Backlash against it arguably ended the Age of Conquest, which some people referred to as the Age of Warships. With the onset of the Age of Mechs, mass extinction and widespread slaughter ceased to happen, but that didn’t mean it stopped happening entirely.
Missile barrages notoriously inflicted wide swathes of devastation. With the effectiveness of ECM these days, over eighty or ninety percent of missiles never hit their targets. Instead, they veered away and flew a bit further before exploding upon the first obstacle they came across.
Many cities hollowed out and collapsed this way.
Cannons also frequently pled guilty to this, but surprisingly the humbler laser rifle took the crown. Their ubiquity, availability and low cost per discharge meant that mech pilots who piloted laser rifleman mechs frequently showered their opponents with laser beams.
Ballistic rifleman and railgunner mechs exercised much stricter trigger discipline because they couldn’t afford to waste their ammunition.
Therefore, Vs got a completely different conception of laser rifleman mechs. Who knew that the humble straight and narrow laser beams actually resulted in more deaths and collateral damage than more explosive weapons?
"This is mainly the fault of the mech pilot."
If these laser-happy mech pilots exercised the same trigger discipline as their ballistic and kinetic counterparts, they wouldn’t let this statistic balloon.
"This isn’t my responsibility."
By now, over a thousand Blackbeak mechs circulated throughout the Bright Republic and elsewhere. Ves did not keep tabs on what their pilots did. Someone could have crashed their mech through a school full of children and Ves wouldn’t know. Even if he did, what did it have to do with him?
"People don’t blame a shuttle manufacturer if some madman took their shuttle, hacked all the safeties, and crashed it into office building."
The only reason he would check up on his products was to see whether their X-Factor aged and developed unique flavors. Right now, it would be too early to tell, so Ves planned to wait a couple of years before performing an in-depth study of the effects.
Once the shuttle arrived at the convention hall, Ves went inside and oversaw the final preparations of the product reveal. This time, the LMC went for a more elaborate concept that transformed the entire hall into a projected battlefield. It all looked impressive and lifelike as Marcella’s brokerage supplied the advanced equipment to turn illusion into a hyper-realistic simulations.
The experience went beyond spectacular visuals. Ves felt the vibrations from the footsteps of a Crystal Lord as it walked by. He could heard the sharp tang of a laser rifle discharge as another projected mech fired its weapon at a distant enemy mech.
For the battlefield, they picked out a sprawling ruined urban landscape. Rubble and debris littered much of the abandoned city, as months of fighting turned every street into an unlivable mess.
"This is what happens after every battle."
Seeing the awful state of the buildings and the remains of abandoned vehicles strewn about put everyone present in a somber mood. In light of the recent attack on the Coscos System, Ves opted to color his presentation in a serious tone. He nixed the original plan which involved excessive cheer and exuberance.
Not everyone supported this last-minute style change, but Ves knew that they needed to be tactful in order to avoid public condemnation.
"Are all the props and projectors in place?"
"We installed and tested every prop yesterday. Everything works as planned, boss." Gavin answered as he studied a data pad that contained all of their planning. "All nine mechs are shipped in place as well, with the first production model standing in the place of honor."
"How about the permits? Did we receive permission from the convention hall and the authorities to activate all nine mechs?"
"We only managed to do so after Marcella’s brokerage greased the wheels. It’s harder than usual for the LMC to do business in Bentheim because we aren’t based here. We only have a branch office that’s in charge of marketing and after-sales support, and it’s too small for us to cultivate important relationships with the people in power. If not for Marcella’s deep connections, we wouldn’t have been able to get away with this plan."
Ves nodded as if he expected the outcome. As the LMC grew up from a one-man operation into a medium mech manufacturer, he gradually realized that many rules could be overcome with a sufficient amount of power and influence. Nothing was impossible, and only very few rules turned out to be absolute.
While the prohibition on activating mechs was a very sensible one to limit the chances of disaster in the middle of a densely-populated city, too many people flouted these rules and got away with it. "It’s like an unofficial tax."
A few hours went by as Ves prepared and rehearsed his presentation. He couldn’t delegate the responsibility of introducing the Crystal Lord design to anyone else. Mech designers needed to show their pride at their own products. Therefore, even if he wasn’t the best public speaker in the company, he readily accepted the responsibility.
In the meantime, the entrance to the hall opened up and let in the first attendees. The journalists and representatives of various publications and organizations arrived first. They blinked past the omnipresent projections of the ruined urban landscapes and the silhouettes of the new design skulking in the shadows and claimed their preferred spots to record the upcoming press conference.
Batches of collectors arrived next. Some of them previously showed up to the Blackbeak’s reveal event as well, but for many of them, this would be the first time they got to see Ves up close.
The mech industry as a whole started to take note of the LMC due to the spread of the Blackbeaks. While the poorest mercenary corps eschewed the expensive models entirely, many of the better-off outfits started to take a shine on the models.
It came in three slightly different flavors with varying levels of pricing and availability, so everyone with money could take their pick. As these influential forces started using the Blackbeaks, their benefits became evident as well.
Besides their performance, the Blackbeaks also became renowned for their ability to accommodate mech pilots particularly well. Whether in terms of ergonomics or the elusive ’feel’, the Blackbeaks stood out for their excellence in making pilots feel as comfortable as if they returned to their mother’s wombs.
Now, with the rumored introduction of a second model which inherited most of the traits of the Blackbeak, some of the industry insiders wanted to see what the fuss was all about. As they milled forward and took their seats, they started guessing what the LMC had in store for them. This time, news of their development hadn’t leaked out, which was a minor accomplishment in itself.
"You’re up in five minutes." Gavin reminded Ves as the hall became increasingly packed.
"I know. I’m ready to go at any moment."
"Be careful of the hecklers in the crowd. Since we opened our doors to bystanders, you can bet on getting challenged on the spot."
The massive convention hall would appear to be too empty if they held the press conference in front of a modest gaggle of invited guests. In order to make the reveal event appear more successful, they advertised the event to the people walking past the convention hall. Anyone could enter for free once they registered their identities.
Despite the gloom on the streets, they managed to fill up the hall just enough to make the place seem packed. Naturally, it also led to a bit of chaos as bored teenagers and crying babies added to the noise.
They quieted down once a massive projection appeared that introduced the LMC and its recent history. The introduction was meant to build up some hype before the actual event.
Moments later, someone sent a signal to Ves. "That’s my cue."
As Ves appeared on the podium, a modest round of applause rang out. He confidently strolled to the front and beheld his audience. "Welcome to the Living Mech Corporation’s second product reveal. As the founder and chief designer of the LMC, it is my mission to offer people like you the option to purchase a mech that’s different."
He extended his hands which caused a life-like silhouette of the Crystal Lord to loom behind him. The mech was no projection this time, but an actual physical copy piloted by a real mech pilot. Clever use of lighting caused the mech to be obscured to the point where the audience couldn’t spot its laser rifle.
The mech hadn’t even revealed its visage, but already the crowd became subjected to a formless pressure that originated from its X-Factor.
"Our new design is an extension of the philosophy that underpins the Blackbeak. Much like the knight design, our latest offering is a tough, enduring and well-balanced machine. After months of development, we have managed to succeed in designing a mech that translates all of these strengths into a different archetype."
"Is it another knight mech?" Someone from the press suddenly asked out loud.
Ves smiled at the reporter. "It is not. While the LMC is known for its history of publishing knight designs, we are not exclusively focusing on a single type of mech. Instead, our latest design adopts a very different role on the battlefield. I am sure that you will be astounded by the features we’ve packed into our latest design."
Ves meandered a little with his speech as he talked around his new design without revealing it. Anticipation built up in the crowd as they got entranced by his words. It didn’t help that their surroundings grew increasingly busy as the simulations took to life by depicting a lifelike battle.
"We at the LMC are committed to offer our customers an alternative to the dominant models of the market. We pride ourselves to delivering quality and uniqueness. Rather than tread the path of my colleagues, our next design is sufficiently distinct that we can say with some confidence that nothing like it has ever been released in the Komodo Star Sector!"
Everyone’s anticipation had reached the peak. Ves quickly watched for cues from Gavin who stood unobtrusively at the side. His assistant passed on a signal that indicated that he already spent more than enough time on sidestepping around the main event.
Ves bowed and moved on with the revelation of his new design. "Introducing our first range of rifleman mechs, the Crystal Lord!"
Lights banished the darkness obscuring the frame. For the first time in history, the Crystal Lord entered into the view of the public.
Gasps sounded out as everyone beheld the unusual-looking design.
"It’s a rifleman mech! Medium weight class, armed with a laser rifle, carrying an external backpack module."
"What a small and compact laser rifle! It’s as small as the rifles wielded by light mechs!"
"Look at those sleek curves. This is a mech that’s optimised for speed. How fast can it run?"
"It’s not only fast, but tough as well. Look at the texture of that mottled brown exterior. That’s the same compressed armor utilized in the Blackbeak design."
"What? The LMC put knight armor onto a rifleman mech design? How crazy is that!"
"I don’t know what this mech does, but I absolutely want a copy no matter the cost!"
"Me too!"
The guessing game started immediately upon the reveal. Everyone’s first impressions was tinged with shock. They felt shocked not only because of its unusual traits, but also because the X-Factor continued to influence their impression of the mech.
It was as if they admired the statue of a god. The Crystal Lord somehow inspired a lot more awe and worship than other mechs.
Ves discretely smiled as he watched the effect play out in front of his eyes.
"Wait a second! What’s that huge transparent material embedded into the chest?"
"That looks like a glass-like composite. Is that a cockpit window or something?"
"Don’t be ridiculous! This mech is obviously built to fight. Incorporating windows in those kinds of mechs is one of the stupidest things you can do!"
The chest crystal sparked another round of speculation. Ves let the crowd go on for half a minute before he resumed his speech.
"Introducing the first generation in the Crystal Lord product line, the CL-A-01 is exquisitely designed to meet the needs of the men and women who are burdened with defending the Bright republic for years on end. It’s a mech designed to last for ages, and is designed from the ground up to maximize its longevity."
Ves spent the next ten minutes going over the basic specs of the mech. He showcased its speed, which was very important for all mobile rifleman mechs. He also reintroduced the Veltrex armor system and its particular properties that made the Crystal Lord a lot more resilient than many other rifleman mechs.
Naturally, he also couldn’t forget about the crystals.
"On top of the amazing level of performance offered by our design, the Crystal Lord also makes use of a feature derived from technology recovered from alien ruins. Let me introduce to you the benefits of the two crystals embedded into each copy."
The Crystal Lord at the front unarched its back a little, giving the crowd a better view of the giant diamond-like crystal.
"The crystal at the chest is not a decorative component. It is a core weapon in the Crystal Lord’s kit that delivers a powerful blow under certain circumstances."
As Ves laid out its properties, someone at the crowd rudely yelled out. "What nonsense is this?! Absorbing energy attacks? Shooting them back out? This is just another useless gimmick that’s only good for marketing!"
Ves did not take offense at the latest hackler. Instead, his smile turned into a grin. "Seeing as how many of you are skeptical, why not witness it in action? We have prepared a secure stage where you can see this feature in action with your own two eyes."
The Crystal Lord walked towards the arena stage that’s been cordoned off since the start of the reveal. The audience eagerly approached the sides of the arena and milled close.
Opposite to the original Crystal Lord stood another copy. Once both mechs took their places, one of them started winding up its laser rifle and began to fire a high-powered laser beam that burned for seconds at a time.
The more knowledgeable people among the crowd looked impressed.
"Look at the power behind that beam! That’s not what you see every day from a rifle that size!"
"Is this laser rifle really a light model? Many medium-sized laser rifles don’t pack that much of a punch!"
"Hey, instead of watching that rifle in action, why not look at the mech that’s being hit. Its armor is still unscatched!"
At this distance and with both mechs standing still with their ECMs turned off, it was impossible for the shooter to miss. Every laser beam landed squarely against the crystal, which sustained minimal damage but instead devoured every bit of energy sent in its way.
The level of absorption demonstrated by the Crystal Lord only applied to the gold label versions of the mech. The chest crystals needed to be really large and activated by the crystal cube before it could withstand the full might of a full-powered laser rifle.
Furthermore, only hits directly to the chest and onto the crystal would have their damage negated. Any laser beams that glanced to the lower chest or the neck and shoulders would only have a fraction of its energy negated.
No matter the truth, Ves would be a fool to inform the crowd of those shortcomings. He wanted to introduce his new design in the best possible light, so he regarded this product reveal as selling a fantasy.
"As you can see, the chest crystal is capable of tolerating high amounts of energy damage and can absorb them inside as well. If you look at the readouts to the side, you can clearly see that we haven’t curbed the power output of the laser rifle in any way. What you are seeing right now is what the new custom laser rifle for the Crystal Lord can output in a sustainable manner!"
"Where can we buy this rifle? It’s lighter and more powerful than anything I’ve seen!"
Ves laughed a little. "We have no plans to produce and sell a standalone laser rifle except to replace a broken sample. This weapon works best with the Crystal Lord, which is highly tailored to this specific rifle model."
"How come this rifle is so powerful?"
"That’s because we incorporated a smaller version of the Crystal Lord’s chest crystal into the mechanism of the rifle. Its many wondrous properties allow us to substitute much of the conventional components that add a lot of bulk to the rifle. It’s smaller and lighter, but still delivers the same amount of damage of a full-sized rifle."
As Ves elaborated on the crystals, the chest crystal quickly reached its saturation point. It could no longer continue to absorb more energy.
"Don’t think this crystal is limited to absorbing energy. What comes in must also come out."
To illustrate his point, the saturated crystal instantly discharged a thick white beam against a target prepared to the side. The white beam burned through multiple layers of armor plating, demonstrating the awesome power behind the cannon-like beam in a direct fashion.
"That power!"
"Look at the energy readings! It’s more powerful than a laser cannon!"
"Hah! More powerful, but is it useful enough? Don’t forget that the crystal absorbed a lot of laser beams. How many mechs will stand still on the battlefield and how many enemies will conveniently aim at their chests? I stand by my words! This is nothing more than a marketing gimmick!"
Some people still remained sober, to which Ves could do not against. It wasn’t as if they distorted the truth. The utility of the crystal was much less than what the mechs depicted.
Still, the overall reaction of the crowd looked encouraging. Ves still managed to sell the idea that the crystals held a lot of utility.
Ves walked back to the podium. The two mechs in the arena followed suit, as did seven other identical mechs.
A strange effect emerged as nine gold label Crystal Lords stood side by side as if they made up a single cohesive squad of mechs. Ves used this trick before and back then he already managed to shock the crowd into silence.
This time, the X-Factor in his design had reached another level. Although Ves wasn’t sure of the difference, he knew that it would definitely deliver a bigger impact on the crowd. Multiple auras blended together and amplified each other. Some of the people rubbed their eyes, while others forgot to blink as they stared at the nine exquisite mechs.
It was as if the Crystal Lords came to life. They collectively radiated a sense of pride and threat. Their dark coloring and strange head shapes added to the sense of mystery behind these mechs.
"The Crystal Lord is more than a product. It is a mech. Not just any mech, but one that will grow on you. This is a mech that can be a lifelong companion to any mech pilot looking to invest in their future."
The projections around them started to depict the Crystal Lord in battle. The simulations crafted a vision where the Crystal Lord endured constant battles, only to be patched up and sent back into battle again. The sequence highlighted its robust construction and its resilience against wear-and-tear and the test of time.
The battles also showcased the fights that best suited the Crystal Lord. It excelled in longer engagements and was suitable to be used in extended deployments.
"We hereby announce the Crystal Lord is available to order from this moment onwards. At the end of this press conference, five of our exclusive gold label Crystal Lords will be auctioned out. The silver label versions of this mech will immediately begin production, but take note that supply is very limited for the time being. Bronze label Crystal Lords will soon enter the market after we have completed negotiations with the appropriate third-party manufacturers."
Sensing the end of the presentation, the crowd and in particular the press started bombarding Ves with questions.
While Ves could have opted to leave the stage, he chose to remain and answer the questions. Despite the risk of facing difficult questions, answering them increased the Crystal Lord’s exposure.
"Your new design sounds very impressive and all, but I can’t help wondering, how much does it cost?"
Immediately, the reporter asked the one question that everyone wanted to find out. The crowd of bystanders might know nothing about mechs, but the people sitting closer to the front knew much more about mechs. What Ves had introduced so far about the Crystal Lord was overwhelmingly positive and definitely outperformed the mainstream rifleman mech models that dominated the market.
"The Crystal Lord is a premium mech design positioned at the upper end of the local market. The base price for the limited-quantity gold label prestige models is 90 million credits."
That caused pretty much everyone to gasp.
"I can buy two good-quality rifleman mechs with that much money!"
"Forget about those overpriced mainstream junk, I’d rather buy four or five budget models instead!"
Ves continued on as if he didn’t hear the outrage. "The silver label Crystal Lords will soon be made available for 75 million credits, whereas the bronze label Crystal Lords will be sold for 65 million credits."
The fact that even the cheapest version came at a more expensive price than the Blackbeak caused everyone to become perplexed. Certainly, the mech was powerful, but did Ves have to be so greedy?
If not for the nine mechs standing in a row behind him, the crowd would have been more vocal in their outrage.
"Absurd! This toy is too expensive! I’m out of here!"
"I don’t know. It’s expensive and all, but we can afford to buy one. It’s a pretty good mech if you only want quality."
Another reporter put forth a question. "Mr. Larkinson, your Crystal Lord looks very impressive. What we want to know is did you design this mech by yourself?"
"I worked on this design from the beginning of the design process. Only at the very end did I consult an anonymous mech designer. That entity who shall remain nameless generously tweaked my design and optimized it further."
"So it’s not your own work!"
"I have meticulously logged the design process to the MTA to back my words. Much of the Crystal Lord’s DNA is still my own work. The anonymous contributor only smoothed out some inefficiencies."
Some people looked skeptical, while others showed a more understanding expression. Those familiar with his history automatically assumed that Master Olson had lent a hand.
Most people didn’t care. They only wanted to see or get a hold of a good mech. The fact that Ves accepted help only added to the soundness of the Crystal Lord design.
"The quality of the Crystal Lord is acknowledged by the MTA as well. Those who wish to acquire an open licensing contract of the Crystal Lord design will have to pay an upfront sum of 5 billion credits."
As soon as he revealed the figure, the crowd turned numb yet again. Five billion credits was an extremely impressive number for an Apprentice Mech Designer. Most designs only held a value of 500 million to 2 billion credits.
The skeptics grew less skeptical as they quietly referenced their comms. The moment Ves mentioned the figure, he knew that some of the attendees wanted to confirm his words. Therefore, he arranged for the secrecy around his design to be dropped at that moment.
Everyone could browse the MTA’s public database and call up the entry for the CL-A-01. Ves hadn’t lied. The info page prominently displayed the license valuation at 5 billion bright credits.
"A design worth 5 billion credits! That’s unreal!"
"Who validated this gimmicky design? The MTA should investigate whether the people who tested this mech have slept on the job. There’s no way it’s worth 5 billion credits!"
"Maybe this mech has something going for it. I don’t know, but the MTA has never been wrong."
The credibility of the MTA formed a powerful cushion which stopped the skeptics from spreading any falsehoods. Ves had tactfully left the MTA’s valuation at the end of this product reveal because he needed to counterbalance the negative sentiment that emerged when he detailed the sticker prices of his mechs.
Right now, the 5 billion license valuation overshadowed the earlier event entirely. Every mech insider spoke with glowing words as they discussed the awesome sum among themselves. In this light, charging well over 60 million credits for a single Crystal Lord didn’t sound so crazy anymore.
Ves managed to raise the expectations of his potential customers. This was good for him, but not so good for others. This would be the perfect time for someone to spoil the party.
"I have a question!" A thirty-something year old woman with curling blond hair and a stylish beret stood up and asked.
The way she spoke with force and gravitas somehow pulled everyone’s attention to her. Ves instantly recognized the training put the manner she modulated her voice. She meticulously trained to achieve this effect.
"Go ahead." Ves replied simply, trying to appear as unruffled as possible even as he recognized he faced a tough customer.
"I do not doubt the craftsmanship of these admittedly impressive copies, but they are from your top-of-the-line label, are they not? How many of them will be made available, and what are the differences between these mechs and your readily available offerings?"
Ves may have been able to dazzle most customers, but the woman spotted the loopholes in his presentation. Against this line of questioning, he had no choice but to tell the truth.
"The Living Mech Corporation’s gold label mechs all come with a guarantee that they have been handcrafted by myself. Therefore, they are only available in limited quantities. Of the nine mechs you see before you, five is made available for auction while the other four is reserved for internal use. For the time being, the LMC will not be releasing any gold label mechs, for obvious reasons."
The mech insiders nodded in understanding. Many mech designers already disappeared from Bentheim, making it a much less livelier place. Once the Mech Corps called up the second wave of mech designers, the only ones who remained would be the elderly and the special cases.
With regards to the limited quantity of gold label Crystal Lords, the news benefited the collectors the most. The rarer the model, the more valuable their investment, though they also had to be prepared to bid high in order to get their hands on a copy.
"There are differences between the three labels." Ves continued. "The gold label version is the most complex design in this product line and features the largest chest crystal that has received special treatment that makes it more effective. The silver label Crystal Lords that my company produced in-house is nearly identical to the gold label version, but incorporates very small amounts of simplification in its construction and will also host a smaller chest crystal, but will similarly benefit from special treatment."
"What’s the performance difference?!"
"Both the silver and bronze label chest crystals are unable to hold as much energy, so they will reach their saturation at roughly half the amount. Their output will be similarly affected by the same proportion."
This put a slight damper on everyone’s enthusiasm. A single beam with twice the power of a laser cannon was very impressive because it outputted a very high amount of thermal energy at once. This helped a lot in terms of penetrating heavily-armored opponents.
With a half-strength beam, this effect would be much less pronounced. Unless the mech pilot possessed supreme control, it would be impossible for two half-powered laser beams to hit the same spot on a moving target. The damage would certainly be spread out over a wider surface area.
Therefore, even if they outputted the same amount of energy, the effective damage differed remarkably. On the battlefield, these differences could become a matter of life and death.
"What’s the use of this gimmick then?"
"Do not forget that it offers a remarkable amount of defense against directed energy weapons. The beams unleashed by the bronze and silver label Crystal Lords are still extremely powerful and can deliver a sucker punch to any opponent regardless of the expenditure of their laser rifles."
Ves thought about this problem and before and delivered a prepared response without any hitchups. Since most of the Crystal Lords made available consisted of lesser quality mechs, it was important for the LMC to highlight the usefulness of the smaller crystals.
In any case, Ves mainly spoke to the mech insiders in the crowd. As long as he won them over, he achieved his goal.
Sadly, the woman wasn’t done. "Do you have a physical copy here so we can compare their differences?"
"We do not have one on hand, but we can provide something even better." Ves replied and snapped his fingers.
A large amount of carrying bots emerged from a back entrance. They all carried high-quality portable simulator pods supplied by Marcella’s brokerage. The bots brought over a hundred of these pods at a time.
"Any potentate here is free to try out the virtual copies of each version of the Crystal Lord for fifteen minutes at a time! You may opt to test out the mech in a number of prepared scenarios, from empty sandboxes to complex battlefield environments."
A substantial portion of the crowd lit up at the appearance of the simulator pods. Though they only worked for potentates, a significant part of the crowd actually consisted of active duty or retired mech pilots.
"Is there any multiplayer available, or will the simulations serve us with AI-controlled bots?" The woman asked.
This was important, because the LMC meticulously placed the setpieces in the simulations to bring out the Crystal Lord’s potential. Allowing the attendees to bring the Crystal Lord design in an online competitive environment might lead to awkward situations where the design failed to demonstrate any value.
As a design that thrived in longer engagements, the Crystal Lord did not favor the high-intensity combat inherent in mech duels.
"From tomorrow onwards, the LMC will release all three labels of the Crystal Lord onto Iron Spirit and other virtual games. Those present here will be allowed to experience our new products in a variety of situations."
Ves admittedly dodged the issue, but did it in the best way possible. People would still be able to test out the Crystal Lord in more dynamic combat situations, they just needed to wait another day.
In fact, Gavin proposed to delay the release of the virtual mechs by a single day for several reasons. First, it stopped the naysayers from pointing out that the LMC lacked confidence in their own designs. If the female heckler continued to ask, Ves could easily put out an excuse that they delayed the release due to technical or legal reasons.
Secondly, a delay of a single day might not sound like a big deal, but it would be way too late for the reporters who raced to publish their pieces on the press conference by the end of the day.
The news portals all prided themselves on delivering up-to-date news. It made no sense for them to wait another day just to test out the Crystal Lord a little more. After all, Ves already brought out a sufficient number of readily available simulator pods. Who cared if he manipulated the the scenarios?
The reporters that attended the press conference came here to cover a product reveal. Reviewing the mechs could be done by specialists at a later date.
The woman very obviously looked unresigned. Ves made ample preparations this time. The previous instance where Ves allowed himself to get caught up in the moment when Michael Dumont challenged him to a design duel wouldn’t happen again.
Ves couldn’t read any hesitation in her eyes, but he figured that she might be adjusting her plans right now.
"Fair enough." She said. "Yet you still have all of these working, physical copies on display. Why not showcase their capabilities in a live duel?"
That caused the crowd to swing back in her favor. Her argument sounded very compelling. No matter the benefits of experiencing a simulation, they all lacked the raw, visceral impact of real mechs fighting against each other in front of their eyes.
"The Crystal Lord is not a duelling mech. Its a high-mobility premium rifleman mech that maintains its strength for hours at a time whereas many other mechs might reach their limits at that time. Unless we reserve the largest arena on Bentheim and let the duel format stretch for hours, you won’t be able to appreciate the Crystal Lord’s true value."
A lot of people looked disappointed. Suitable or not, everyone loved to watch a mech duel. They found it rather disappointing that Ves did not plan on showcasing the power of his mech in any duel.
His answer also precluded any challenges. Cowardly as he might seem, Ves left little means in which others could challenge him to a design duel.
Ves figured that the woman who asked the questions might be a mech designer. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been able to hone in on the holes in his presentation. He smirked minutely at her, as if he was confident he could defeat all of her tricks.
Right now, the only thing that could lead to a lot of trouble is if someone insisted on a duel. In fact, it looked like the woman still possessed a means to pressure Ves.
"I have a friend who is a mech designer. He happens to have designed a similar mech in terms of performance. Why not accept a challenge from my friend?"
"Hahaha!" Ves laughed. "Does his mech sell for upwards of 90 million credits? Has he incorporated an energy-absorbing light crystal in its chest? Is his laser rifle as light as mine? I doubt it unless your friend is a Journeyman Mech Designer!"
Not a lot of mech models sold for 90 million credits in the first place in the Bright Republic. They mostly consisted of customized designs that incorporated a rudimentary level of resonance.
His retort left the woman with little openings to pursue her challenge. Whether her friend was at the same level as Ves or not, the chances of coming up with a mech that was similar to the Crystal Lord was minute.
Although the crowd would still enjoy a duel between mechs of different configurations, it didn’t serve that much of a point in the context of a design duel.
An ordinary mech duel tested the skill of the mech pilots and the qualities of their machines. It was primarily a contest between the pilots. The designers played second fiddle in that regard.
A design duel on the other hand tested the skill of the mech designers in designing the best mechs possible. If the mechs shared little in common, then the influence of other factors such as the matchups between different types of mechs and the skill of the mech pilots became more relevant.
Such duels still went on, but the person being challenged would generally be regarded as a genius or a fool.
The woman appeared to open her mouth once again, but Ves forcefully forestalled her words by holding up his palm. "There are other guests who want to ask a question. Let them have their turn."
Raising his palm in this way was actually a signal for someone in the backstage to muffle the woman’s words. As she attempted to utilize her compelling voice yet again, no sound escaped her throat. Hidden machines embedded into the convention hall dampened the sound of her voice just as they left her mouth, preventing anyone else from hearing her voice.
This was one of the benefits of renting an upscale convention hall. The cheaper ones lacked this convenient feature, forcing organizers to resort to more disruptive means if they wanted to silence a troublemaker.
Still, many mech insiders recognized what went on. His solution had been fairly discrete, but the smart ones in the crowd couldn’t help but lower their impression of Ves and the LMC. As acidic as the woman might have been, she asked a lot of questions that they should have brought up in the first place.
Ves didn’t care.
As Ves continued to answer questions from others, the earlier harsh questioning became less acute in everyone’s minds. That was not to say that the reporters didn’t challenge him on certain points, but they obviously didn’t care whether the Crystal Lord succeeded in becoming a hit.
All they wanted was more material to add to their articles, and Ves largely obliged.
Once the first attendees exited from the simulator pods, they shared their remarkable experiences to the people waiting in line.
"Remarkable! It’s so lifelike! This is the best mech I’ve ever piloted!"
"I can’t believe how much at home I feel when I pilot the Crystal Lord! I tried all three versions and the gold label mech is by far the most sublime!"
"The cheaper bronze label model is no slouch either! Let me tell you, my mercenary corps already owns a silver label Blackbeak. Piloting a bronze label Crystal Lord is almost the exact same experience!"
Their subjective experiences and lack of technicalities that they could point out as issues led to a growth in positivity. Everyone focused on the good points of his design, and those who tried the models out in the simulations came away with strong desire to pilot the mech again.
"Fifteen minutes is too short! I can’t wait until tomorrow to pilot this virtual mech again! I need the real deal!"
"When will the auction start? Let me get my hands on a copy as fast as possible!"
Ves deliberately arranged the simulator pods to be placed in the vicinity of the nine gold label Crystal Lords. He also allowed the guests to approach the mechs and touch their cool metallic surface. This way, the vast majority of the attendants became exposed to the mutually amplified auras radiated by the mechs.
It was difficult to describe their effects on the people who neared the mechs. Everyone gazed at the machines with reverence. Some even lowered their heads in respect. As they discussed the Crystal Lord design among themselves, their thoughts and words would unconsciously be colored by their altered moods.
Nobody showed any awareness of this effect. As far as Ves was concerned, he achieved the same effect as outright drugging them into liking the Crystal Lord design.
The thought of it caused him to smirk, and as he continued to make himself available for questioning, he radiated supreme confidence in his work.
Under the intangible but near-oppressive might of the Crystal Lords, no one dared to affront their dignity by mentioning any shortcomings. Most of the crowd subjected those that raised any critical points with dirty looks. Under this strong social pressure, troublemakers found little means to raise another ruckus.
Of course, Ves and the LMC did not leave everything over to fate. After answering another question, Ves briefly excused himself and walked to the side. Gavin greeted him with a nod as he kept his eyes on his data pad.
"How many troublemakers have been carted away by security?"
"Twenty-five and counting." Gavin answered. "Since they only tried to heckle you, Sanyal-Ablin isn’t able to hold them back and question them. We haven’t been able to trace whether they attempted to stir up trouble on behalf of others and who their employers might be."
"Don’t count on finding that out even if we held them custody. These professional agitators are smarter than that." Ves grunted. "Still, Sanyal-Ablin is surprisingly effective in rolling them up before they could make a scene."
Gavin raised his head and grinned. "That’s what you get when you hire the best. SASS has a lot of experience in crowd control. It makes sense when you consider how obsessive the Konsu Clan is about conformity. The AIs they employ are keeping a close watch on every attendants at once. The moment they attempt to raise their voice, the sound dampeners immediately silence their throats."
"Too bad they didn’t caught that woman." Ves frowned. "Why hasn’t security stepped in?"
"They couldn’t silence her at the time because she took the place of an invited guest and sat close to the front. By standing up, she called out a lot of attention to herself while making any attempts at silencing her really obvious. Her voice also carried a strange property that inserted doubts in the AI."
That was something else he wanted to know about. "Who is she, anyway? How come she’s in our guest list?"
"Her name is Mellie Neverland. She’s actually a cousin of Andar Neverland. She’s a mech designer as well, though she works at one of the larger mech manufacturers in Ansel. According to her record, she doesn’t have a lot of designs under her belt. She only contributed a small part of a couple of larger collaborative projects."
He somewhat understood her background now. "She’s a graduate of the Ansel University of Mech Design, isn’t she?"
Gavin looked down at the data pad. "You’re right!"
An outsider like Gavin might not be fully aware of the influence of the AUMD. Ves guessed that Mellie had been tasked by someone from the AUMD to drag down the perceived value of the Crystal Lord as much as possible.
"Could it be Mr. Neverland who is behind Mellie’s attempt?" Gavin spoke out.
Ves shook his head. "It doesn’t make any sense for him to do so. He’s earned a sizable fortune with mass producing the bronze label Blackbeaks for the domestic market. Sure, his Elemental Mech Engineering isn’t suited to produce the Crystal Lord, but that is no reason to risk his current licensing contract with us. The mastermind is likely someone else connected to the AUMD."
As for why someone from the AUMD wanted to spoil his party, Ves could think up a lot of reasons. It might be due to animosity against those who with foreign ties, or an attempt to diminish his value in front of the Mech Corps so that he wouldn’t take away a plump assignments from their graduates.
"I don’t get it, boss. Why does the AUMD feel the need to put you down?"
"They feel threatened by someone like me. I studied at Rittersberg, a place filled with spoiled brats descended from decadent billionaires and poisonous politicians. A small number of mech designers who graduated from my school act all high and mighty once they enter the industry. They compensate their lack of talent and ability by bullying everyone aside with their connections or their wealth."
"I thought the mech industry is an extremely competitive field." Gavin replied with puzzlement. "Shouldn’t those rich kids make fools of themselves once they publish a couple of designs?"
"Ordinarily, their lack of talent is exposed in very short order. You’re right in that the market won’t be fooled by a bad design. However, those with means have other tricks available to them. The easiest way is to hire or coerce a more capable mech designer into designing mechs in their stead."
"I see." Gavin nodded. "So these good-for-nothings stay in business far longer than they ought to. Still, isn’t it easy to expose them in that case?"
"Hahaha." Ves laughed in a low tone. "Who would dare go against their influence by challenging their competence? Anyone who sticks out their head won’t gain a lot of rewards, but instead piss off a powerful influence."
"Still, you don’t seem like one of those spoiled brats you’re talking about. Unlike them, you’ve demonstrated your actual skill several times in public."
"That’s even worse. Since the graduates of the AUMD can’t take out their frustration on those spoiled brats, they train their firepower on schmucks like me. Even though I enjoy some backing as well, they can’t help me out in this area."
"Why not? You’re a Larkinson and an apprentice of a Master Mech Designer. That should scare loads of people off."
"Those influences can deter a casual bystander, but they don’t look so scary to those in the know. We Larkinsons are fairly famous in the mech pilot circles, but we don’t have any influence in the industry other than myself. As for my Master, she’s many light-years away from the Bright Republic. I’m just a nominal disciple, so how much does she really care about me?"
The few times she met her, Ves in fact felt as if Master Olson genuinely cared about him, if only a little bit. Perhaps she might have ulterior motives and perhaps she saw a use for him in the future, but Ves never got the impression that she regarded him as dirt.
Still, as busy as she was, Ves never fooled himself into thinking that he registered high in her list of priorities. A Master Mech Designer wielded enough influence to affect the entire Friday Coalition. She probably spent most of her time on developing her own enterprises.
"Besides catching people who wanted to make a fuss, Sanyal-Ablin also caught a couple of armed people outside the steps." Gavin spoke in a serious tone.
"How many?"
"Only three, but all of them had been kitted out with stealth gear. Regular security companies would have been fooled by these measures."
"These guys aren’t much of a threat even if they managed to sneak inside." Ves waved away the threat. "Whoever sent them is too small-time for us to track them down. Tell Sanyal-Ablin to deliver them to the local authorities and let them handle the thugs as they see fit."
The high-class convention hall hid an abundance of defenses. Before anyone could pull out a gun and shoot into the crowd, a large number of solid plates would emerge from the ground to block his line of fire.
Anyone with a bit of know-how should know about this and more. That a bunch of stealthed assassins or saboteurs attempted to cause a major incident anyway showed their lack of importance.
"Have any more people entered the hall since the end of my presentation?"
"A fair amount of people are constantly coming through. In fact, it’s starting to become a problem. Too many people are entering, and not enough are going out! By now, Sanyal-Ablin is forcing the people outside to queue up and wait their turn."
"This is a good sign." Ves smiled. "The men and women clamoring to come inside must have heard about the event from a broadcast or through word of mouth. What they heard about the Crystal Lord must have been extremely positive as well. Otherwise, they won’t be coming in such great numbers."
"A lot of mech designers are attempting to enter as well. Per your orders, the guards refused them entry."
"Good." Ves nodded.
Mellie Neverland and a handful of other mech designers only got to attend this product reveal because of their relations to him or the LMC.
Ves did not look forward to getting challenged to a design duel, so he straightforwardly forbid entry to other mech designers. Perhaps he might be pissing off a lot of fellow colleagues, but he wouldn’t be the first mech designer to do so.
He found it more important to retain complete control than to please potential troublemakers.
Once he took a look at the contents of the data pad, Ves nodded to Gavin and patted his shoulder. "Keep up the good work. Try and find a way to get people to leave. I want as many people to witness my mechs as possible today."
"That’s going to be really hard. Look at their faces. Do any of the attendees look like they want to go?!"
"Figure something out with Sanyal-Ablin. They should be good in this as well."
Around ten minutes later, Ves saw a result. He didn’t know how, but Sanyal-Ablin managed to set up a rotation. Aside from the invited guests, everyone else could only linger in the hall for a limited amount of time.
Time went by and Bentheim’s sun fell over the horizon. By the end of the local day, tens of thousands of citizens and tourists visited the hall and got a close glimpse of the nine impressive mechs.
The auction held at the evening went great as well. The collectors and representatives all stewed underneath the combined auras for hours at a time.
Such a strong and pervasive exposure to the effects from the X-Factor of the mechs inured them to its influence. However, even if they got used to the charm of the mechs, they still couldn’t think about parting from their presence.
The representatives of different collectors who hadn’t decided to attend all did their best in convincing their bosses to bid on the gold label mechs. Some even managed to pull their collectors from whatever they were doing in order to attend the auction in person.
This led to a raft of eye-watering bidding. The most expensive mech auctioned for 134 million credits while the cheapest one went for a respectable 122 million credits.
While the winning bids hadn’t reached the level he had hoped, Ves could still call this day a success.
"Still, even if I managed to woo the crowd, I don’t know if the rest the market will be so easily convinced."
Without seeing the mechs in person, others wouldn’t be drugged by their auras. Will the Crystal Lord models still appeal to them? Ves could only wait until tomorrow to find out.
After a successful day of presenting the Crystal Lord, Ves patiently slept and waited until the next day to find out the public’s response.
As he ate breakfast in his hotel room, Gavin came up to him and provided him with a brief report.
"Almost every publication who attended the press conference wrote glowing praise about the Crystal Lord! We succeeded in wowing them and transfer their enthusiasm in their reporting!"
Ves accepted the data pad and skimmed through the articles they published in the morning. Some delivered unfiltered words of admiration, while others looked more restrained, as if the editors of the publications forcefully leashed their over-enthusiastic reporters.
Nonetheless, getting that much was more than sufficient for the LMC. Interest in the Crystal Lord obviously spiked upwards and millions of people started looking up the mech on the galactic net after just a few hours of exposure.
"What about the negative articles?"
"There are a lot of other publications who are trying to throw shade on the Crystal Lord. Some of them are excessively negative while others express some doubts at its value proposition. I don’t believe that all of these news portals are following someone’s orders. They just don’t buy into the hype."
"Hm, that’s to be expected." Ves nodded gravely as he sipped a cup of coffee. "Even though the Crystal Lord looks impressive when you see it in person, it’s hard to convey its value onto a spec sheet. It’s unusual for an Apprentice Mech Designer like me to publish such an expensive design."
"The main point the skeptics are raising is if it is a product looking for a market. Most rifleman mech models in this price range are designed by Journeyman, and all of their products are a notch above your own in terms of value for money. The only wildcard is the amount of value your gimmick can bring to the table."
Ves smirked. "That’s exactly why I kept working on this feature that all of you thought was a big waste of time. I never intended it to be a game-changer in a battle. As long as people think it’s useful enough to justify its price, it’s accomplishing its mission."
The virtual models of the design appeared onto the different simulation games as well, allowing the public to explore their strengths at their own pace. The first reviews already reached glowing levels as many of them became affected the X-Factor of the virtual mechs they piloted.
As Ves read through the reports, he got a sense that this effect became a lot stronger than compared with the Blackbeak. Anyone who piloted the virtual version of the offensive knight design came away with much less enthusiasm.
Perhaps that was one of the main differences between B and C-grade X-Factors. The responses of the early adopters sounded no different than those who piloted any of his mechs in person.
This happened to have formed a powerful boost for the newly published Crystal Lord. The overwhelmingly positive feedback elevated the virtual models to a whole new level. As they gained in popularity, they also became more prominent in the virtual marketspace, leading to more curious players trying them out.
"It’s too bad that it’s a fairly demanding mech to pilot." Gavin noted sullenly. "It’s classified as a 5-star virtual mech in Iron Spirit, so not a lot of people are qualified to purchase and pilot it in the first place."
Right now, the higher-leagued player base of online games like Iron Spirit had plummeted due to the war. These working men and women needed to focus their full attention on surviving the war. They had no time to waste on games in simulations that didn’t cut it as a professional training tool.
Ves still smiled. "The more exposure, the better. Great things start from small steps. Building up some grassroots popularity for our new design is never a bad thing. The more the laymen talk about it, the more the professionals take note. Word will spread, and eventually interest will blow over to the people in charge of procuring mechs."
"Actual sales are still very modest. We may have received a lot of orders for the silver label Crystal Lord, but we aren’t getting any further orders except from those who attended the conference."
They both knew that the Crystal Lord might be off to a rough start. Ves already thought about it extensively and believed that the situation might change once people start to convey their experiences with piloting the mechs in circulation. "These things take time. It’s normal for potential buyers to hold back on purchasing an expensive mech. They want to avoid being scammed, so they’ll only start to move once we receive some positive feedback from the first wave of customers."
"Yeah, about that, we’re kind of in a tight spot with regards to production. I don’t need to tell you this, but the Mech Nursery is bottlenecked by the fact that it only runs three production lines. That was already insufficient with the silver label Blackbeak and now with the silver label Crystal Lord on top, their waiting lists have reached an insane proportion."
This was one problem that the LMC couldn’t easily solve. "We already went into debt in order to finance the acquisition of two additional Benson production lines. Do we have to dig a deeper hole?"
"You can always have the company issue more stock. The LMC is obviously on the rise, so its stock is really hot right now."
"No. Absolutely not." Ves quickly shook his head. "I haven’t changed my mind on this stance. The other shareholders don’t want to dilute their ownership. Personally, I don’t feel desperate enough to sell my own shares either."
The LMC currently faced a paper loss resulting from missed opportunities. That was an entirely different to sustaining real losses by spending much more money than they earned from their revenue streams.
Basically, the company was already in a pretty good spot, but everyone wanted to move over to a better position. They just had to pay a price in order to do so.
Ves already relayed his opinion on the matter to Calsie, and tasked her to coordinate with the board and the Finance Department to find out a solution that made everyone happy. With the LMC’s financial growth prospects, taking out another loan shouldn’t be difficult, but the sticking point was the amount of investment they wanted to make.
A conservative expansion entailed acquiring two second-hand production lines on the cheap, while more ambitious plans called for diving deep into debt into order to finance a whopping amount of six new production lines.
Though Ves did not look forward to saddling the LMC with debt, in the long run it paid off. The only worry was that something drastic happened in the meantime that might disrupt the company’s future profit streams.
In these uncertain times, it became increasingly harder for mech manufacturers to obtain loans at favorable rates. One of the most awful consequences of the earlier mass raids by the Vesians was that banks suddenly hiked all of their interest rates overnight. It was a lot more expensive to owe money to them after that point.
This was why the question of financing a further expansion required a lot of consideration. Even after they made a decision, they might spend a month or two on negotiating the best possible terms with the banks they wanted to go in bed with. Once they finally managed to acquire the production lines and get them up and running with an expanded crew of mech technicians, at least half a year might have gone by.
All the while, demand for the Crystal Lord piled up.
To placate the urgent demand, the LMC pretty much had to resort to relying on third-party manufacturers yet again. This was something else that Ves had delegated to Calsie and the rest.
"What kind of third-party manufacturers are expressing interest in producing the bronze label Crystal Lords?"
"Well, first off, you’ve got Vaun Industrial." Gavin began. "They are remarkably open in their intentions, despite not earning as much from their Blackbeaks as they hoped. Bronze label Blackbeaks only make up a tiny portion of their total earnings, so it’s rather unusual for them to be so forward about licensing the Crystal Lord. I get the idea that if not for the steep 5 billion credit price tag for the standard contract, they might have already signed it instead of coming up to us."
Ves nodded. "Vaun Industrial is a big player, and they excel in volume and precision. I don’t really like to go into business with them though, but it’s hard to refuse a partner once they have a foot in the door."
Unspoken was the fact that despite the lack of passion in their production methods, they did a really good job in fabricating his mechs. They matched the design schematics to an almost obsessive level of precision, and no one ever reported any major defects from the mechs that rolled off their sophisticated production lines.
"I don’t know why you’re so hung up about Vaun. They’re our best partner by far with regards to the Blackbeaks. They’re a lot better than Neverland’s EME, which still needs constant monitoring from us in order to avoid any slip-ups."
"It’s difficult to explain. It’s enough for you to know that I would rather work with companies like EME with all of its troubles than Vaun. The latter see mechs as commodities while the former knows there is more to quality than mechanical perfection."
Someone like Gavin wouldn’t understand, so they quickly moved on from this point. They discussed some other matters, such as the company’s liquidity and how much they needed to spend on promoting their new design.
"We should keep the hype alive by running occasional ads." Gavin suggested. "Once the hype dies down completely, it’s hard to bring it back to life. We should spend at least 100 million credits a month on this, and that’s the bare minimum. Once Vaun Industrial and other partners crank up their production lines and produce the Crystal Lord by the hundreds, we can really ramp up our promotion by then."
"Even if we’re in the process of acquiring more debt, don’t skimp on the promotion. The first month after publishing a new design is the most crucial period of all. We can’t afford to neglect the importance of shaping everyone’s first impressions of our new mech.
Gavin dutifully noted all of his words and would send them off to Calsie later. In the meantime, Ves finished his breakfast and allowed some attendants to brush up his clothes and appearance. He adopted a couple of smiles until he settled on one that seemed modestly polite.
"How do I look?" Ves asked.
"Confident, but not arrogant. It’s the right look for a mech designer who’s talented and is aware of it. You don’t want to widen that smile, or else you might come across as unhinged."
The reason why they went through the trouble of brushing up his appearance was because they scheduled a whole host of interviews for today. While they hadn’t gotten any major publications to come and talk to Ves, they did garner the interest of many smaller local news portals.
Though they didn’t reach a very wide audience, they formed an influential voice in certain communities. A mosquito’s leg still contained meat, so Ves filled up his plate with as much of them as possible in order to substitute for a single chicken drum.
It was grueling work, though. Ves needed to maintain a constant veneer of poise in front of the recorders.
"Boss, don’t think about how much the interviews will tire you out. Instead, think about what you get out of this. You only have to endure a single day of suffering."
"I don’t know. I feel kind of desperate accepting all of these interviews from hack publications. For example, I don’t even know why you invited The Mech Conspiracy. They’re a bunch of crazies!"
Gavin laughed. "Crazy as they are, they are actually some of the most loyal customers you can have as long as you make them like you. Just study their latest conspiracy theories and find a way to portray the LMC in a good light."
"That’s impossible. These people believe that half of the MTA has been taken over by bots, and that every mech is secretly brainwashing their mech pilots into worshipping some unknown lizard-like race."
"It’s a good thing you don’t look like a lizard."
"Haha."
Despite all of the work that Ves put into promotion his new design, the effect was hardly noticeable, but every little bit helped. He had no doubt that once they finished setting things up with the third-party manufacturers, people would have much more to talk about as more of them got exposed to his mechs.
Throughout the next week, Ves participated in several promotional events in a row. The reason why he filled up his schedule with these activities was because this might be his last opportunity to put in a good word on his newly released design.
After returning back to his hotel room, he felt tired to the bone. Even though his mind and body reached reached a transhuman state, the amount of activities he took part in almost crushed him into a worm. His spiritual exhaustion had reached a peak.
"I can’t do this any longer. I’m not cut out for this line of work."
As the lead designer of the LMC, it was extremely important for Ves to get his face out and shape his audience’s impressions of his new mech. Still, the company relied too much on him to do everything. While he worked to shift some responsibility to others so that it wouldn’t collapse in his absence, Ves realized he overlooked one key player.
The LMC needed a spokesperson.
"Gavin?"
"Yes, boss?"
"Who will take over as the face of the company when I’m gone?"
Unlike Ves who did all the work, Gavin only stayed on the sidelines and arranged his schedule. He still looked relatively fresh and look eager to freshen up his boss so that he could drag them to another promotional event.
The moment Ves asked the question, his assistant looked pained. "Calsie isn’t suitable for this role, and neither am I. We’re too young and we don’t understand mechs the way you do. The best we can put forth is Jake Altern."
Jake was an old man and single-handedly expanded the LMC from a small-scale mech workshop into a proper medium mech manufacturer. The COO knew more about the business side of the company than anyone else, including Ves.
Still, did the LMC benefit from putting forth an old geezer who couldn’t get into the nitty gritty details when it came to discussing the intricacies of mechs?
"Jake is too old and doesn’t have the expertise to answer industry-specific questions." Ves concluded.
"True. A young company such as ours needs to present a dynamic image. Most of our customers are mech pilots or mech commanders who looking for alternatives to the most conventional options on the market. Presenting a stiff and old-fashioned image goes against our positioning."
"Well said, Gavin."
The only problem was that this left no one qualified to represent the LMC in public.
"Boss. If we can’t use an insider, why not adopt an outsider?"
"Hm. I was thinking about that as well."
Not all mech designers wanted to show up in front of a recorder and have his face projected throughout the entire state. They put up different kinds of as their surrogates, and over time this experimentation have led to a number of best practices.
The most popular solution was to put forth a mech pilot as their public voice.
Though not too well-versed in the technical design and construction of a mech, they knew all about the stuff that customers really wanted to know. Mech pilots understood other mech pilots the most. This common level of understanding helped a lot in roping people into becoming their customers.
The only problem was picking the right person. Ves did not want to put up Melkor or anyone else from the Avatars of Myth. Being a spokesperson was a full-time job these days and mech pilots who chose to take on this role needed a lot of grooming to present a knowledgeable but authentic image in public.
"If you don’t have any other suggestions, why not let the LMC sort this problem out on its own?"
Ves would have liked to select his own spokesperson, but he had a feeling he would be gone very soon. "Very well. Put it on their agenda and make sure they select someone by the end of this month. Once the bronze label Crystal Lords are beginning to appear on the market, we need to be more active in our promotion."
They didn’t discuss anything else that evening. Ves was too tired and hit the sack soon after. The next day, a fateful message arrived at his comm.
It was the message that portended his next step in life, for good or ill.
"The Mech Corps is calling."
Ves briefly checked the galactic net and saw that a lot of other mech designers received the same message as well. The Mech Corps formally called up the second wave of mech designers to fight for their state.
Despite knowing that this day was long in coming, Ves still felt uneasy about it. He heard so many second-hand stories about mech designers in the Mech Corps that he didn’t know if he should believe them all. He also didn’t know if the Mech Corps valued him enough to assign him to a meaningful role.
"There’s no use dragging this moment out."
Although the message granted its recipients a generous amount of time before they needed to report to the Mech Corps, Ves wanted to get in early. He learned that tip from a classmate in school.
"Arriving early demonstrates your dutifulness and shows you care."
The Mech Corps constantly kept watch over its mech designers. Those who showed signs of disgruntlement and dragged their feet in their work tended to be transferred away from a research base and be sent straight to the frontlines.
However, before he submitted himself to the Mech Corps, Ves planned to make one final visit. He raised his comm and called up Melinda.
"Hiya Vessie." Melinda greeted him, though not with a smile this time. "I heard about what just happened. You’re joining the war, aren’t you?"
"Yeah." Ves nodded. "Don’t worry about me, I’m not going to be picking up a weapon anytime soon."
Melinda still looked worried. "You should still watch out for yourself. The Mech Corps looks strong on the outside, but it’s made out of countless cliques that fight over every scrap of resources they can get. That’s one of the reasons why I opted to join the Planetary Guard. It’s much simpler here, since we’re only responsible for defending a single planet."
The burden of defending more than a thousand star systems at once fell heavily onto the shoulders of the Mech Corps. It was a difficult job to juggle at the best of times, but once you factoring in the limited amount of funds and resources it had at its disposal, then internal fights often broke out.
Mech pilots being what they were, it wasn’t unheard of for hem to punch each other in their faces. Even upper echelon would sometimes be guilty of this, as they all used to be mech pilots themselves. They learned their entire life how to develop their aggression and channel it against their opponents.
Learning how to compromise came much later in their careers.
"Since I’m going to be cut off from everyone very soon, I’d like to pay a visit to you. Are you free for today?"
"Hm, it’s all hands on deck at the Planetary Guard right now, but we recently stepped down from the highest state of readiness. As long as ask around for some favors, I can probably clear up a couple of hours in my schedule. Is that alright?"
"That sounds great!"
A couple of hours later, Ves arrived at a stately-looking condominium in the middle of Dorum. Melinda’s current apartment was actually one of the rewards he dangled out for her in exchange for piloting the Blackbeak in the duel against Captain Vicar’s Havalax.
As far as condominiums went, the place Melinda lived portrayed a lot of quiet elegance. It was probably a huge hit to women, but others might like it as well for all the peace and quiet it radiated. The inner spaces contained a lot of gardens and minimalistic artwork. Together, they provided residents with a rare moment of serenity in an otherwise busy planet.
Once he reached the top of the condo, Ves stepped inside the penthouse, which commanded a sweeping view over Dorum.
"Welcome to my place!" Melinda waved from a sofa.
"Looks like you are doing well for yourself."
"Heh, ever since the duel, I can’t even show my face in public anymore. Even though a lot of time has passed, hardly anyone forgot about that fight. I beat down a captain of the Mech Corps! Hardly anyone else can claim they can do the same!"
As Ves took a seat on the opposite sofa, Melinda blabbered on about how everyone treated her with more importance. The Planetary Guard started grooming her into an officer while her fellow mech pilots constantly slapped her back for showing that they could measure up against their military counterparts.
Ves smiled at her stories. If not for her current career, she would have made a perfect spokesperson for the LMC.
"What do you think about my new design?"
"I followed your press thingie while I was out on patrol. Don’t tell my captain I did so." She winked at him. "All in all, if you weren’t my cousin, I would have smacked your mouth. Really now, do you really have to charge so much for a rifleman mech? It’s insane!"
"It’s not meant to be a mass-production model. The Crystal Lord offers several enhancements over the mainstream models."
"Hah! Sure, but who would want to buy a single overengineered mech when they can get two normal ones instead?"
"My product doesn’t cater to the average consumer."
"I’m telling you, each time I see you, your mouth is getting bigger and bigger. You’re greedy, Ves. It’s gotten to the point where its blowing over to the rest of the Larkinson Family. Last time I visited Rittersberg, all they talk about is stocks and dividends and how much money you’re going to shovel in their pig-like throats."
Ves laughed awkwardly at that accusation. "Everything’s easier with money. Do you think a fancy place like this can be bought for a couple of credits?"
"That’s not the point I’m trying to make. You used to be small and cute, you know? Just like any other munchkin at the Larkinson Estate."
"I’m a grown person now. My innocence is long gone."
"I get the feeling you lost a lot of other things as well along the way." Melinda spoke with a low voice. "Meeting you again has made me realize you’re turning into something else. The Ves I used to know is slowly making way for a different kind of person."
"What kind of person are you talking about?"
"You’re turning into one of those stereotypical mech designers you see in the dramas. Not the losers who are barely keeping their workshops afloat, but those successful ones who let their achievements grow their egos blow through the roof."
Ves knew what she was referring to. The mech designers portrayed in those stories tended to be the ruthless sort who fought and cheated their way to success. They didn’t hesitate to order a hit on their competitors if they could get away with it. They treated their own subordinates like furniture and their customers like sheep.
In the dramas, mech designers like that often showed up as conceited villains who thought they could get anything they wanted as long as they threw enough money at it. They treated their existence as if they had been descended from gods, and they openly behaved as if the galaxy revolved around their whims.
As Ves momentarily reflected on himself, he had to admit he changed from two years ago. "Even if I’m a different person now, I hardly walk and talk like one of those stupid caricature. I only changed because this is the way that business is done. The true mech industry is hardly cutthroat to the extent where I dress up in stealth clothing and sneak into the bedroom of my rivals to assassinate them in person."
The convoluted stories the entertainment industry came up with regards to mech designers boggled the mind. Though they also broadcasted other stories where mech designers played the hero, it was far too common to see them in the role of ruthless mech magnate.
Melinda didn’t appear to be convinced. She stared hard at Ves as she stood up and walked close to him. Once she reached his position, she extended her hands and grabbed his cheeks, only to pull them apart.
"I know the old Ves is still there! Come on out!"
Ves spent a couple of hours at Melinda’s place. They reminisced about the past and exchanged their thoughts about the war.
Unlike most Larkinsons, Melinda didn’t seem so eager to distinguish herself in the great conflict. "I’m not so hungry to earn acknowledgement from our uncles and aunts. What’s the use of making a name for yourself when you end up in an early grave?"
"You should be careful with such talk. Others might think you’re a coward."
"So what if they did? I’m my own person. I don’t need anyone’s acknowledgement. Besides, I’ve more than earned my chops in the Planetary Guard and that stupid duel."
"What will you do if the war reaches the surface of Bentheim? It could always happen."
"Pah." Melinda dismissively waved her hand. "The Vesians never managed to set foot on Bentheim before and they won’t do so for the foreseeable future. They can’t break the Republic all by themselves."
"It can always happen. No one can be certain of how this war will progress."
"Even if the Vesians arrive at my doorstep, I’ll continue to do my duty. There’s no question about that." Melinda stated with conviction. "Just because I’m not eager to earn for glory doesn’t mean I’ll run away at the first sign of trouble. I merely don’t buy in the glory that the other Larkinsons are talking about. I must be lacking those genes."
No one truly believed the Vesians could succeed in breaking through. They feared the possibility, but hundreds of years or unending failure inured everyone to the status quo.
Ves faintly found that attitude to be wrong. Maybe it was because he experienced these tumultuous times for himself, but his intuition told him that this time would be different. The problem was convincing others of the gravity of this current conflict.
"By the way, have you gotten in touch with Raella?"
Mentioning the current black sheep of the Larkinson Family sank Melinda’s mood to the bottom of a pit.
"She isn’t accepting my calls. From what I can gather, nobody else has managed to get in touch with her. She’s completely involved in her own little world. From the intelligence that the Planetary Guard has gathered, she’s become something of a champion pilot to the Blood Claws. They parade her out whenever they need to fight a mech duel."
"That sounds dangerous."
"I won’t argue that. Raella’s got as much balls as any Larkinson serving in the frontlines. Mech duels that take place in official arenas are already dangerous enough, but the underground arenas are ten times worse. It takes a real survivor to make it out alive from there."
Both of them looked a little worried, but Raella made her bed. If she thought she could handle it, then Ves couldn’t do anything about her reckless choice.
"How influential are the Blood Claws? Are they a big deal?"
Melinda snorted. "Hah! Big deal? They’re massive! They just hide it well. They control roughly a third of Bentheim’s seedy underbelly. Nothing happens on their territory without them knowing about it. They’re a violent bunch and the aftermath of their fights are always a hell to clean up. The only reason why they aren’t mopped up is because we can never stamp them out and the cost would be too much for us to bear."
This was a familiar refrain that every authority figure repeated when someone asked why they hadn’t mopped up the gangs.
"What are the Blood Claws good at?"
"Hm. They don’t have any specialties as far as I know. They’ve dipped their fingers into gambling, extortion, stimulants, pirated mechs and more. Whatever you can think of, they probably have someone doing it. That’s what makes them so pervasive."
"They sound like swell guys."
"They used to be worse. They only cleaned up their act once they couldn’t expand anymore."
He enjoyed his time at Melinda’s, even if he couldn’t stay for long. It was inconvenient for him to travel to Rittersberg, so talking with one more Larkinson besides Melkor reminded him he was a part of the Larkinsons as well. Blood was thicker than water, and Ves had a feeling he needed to count on them sooner or later.
"This might be the last time I see you for several years." Ves said as he stood at her doorstep. "I hope you take care of yourself, and keep an eye on my company as well."
She shrugged. "Will do, though it doesn’t look like your company needs it. Your new mech is catching a lot of attention."
"I’m glad to hear that."
Ves checked the updated status report on the exposure of the Crystal Lord. Interest in the mech grew significantly, mostly because several pilots tried them out in simulators. Their good impressions translated into glowing praise, which attracted their friends to try a hand at piloting the mech as well.
Even with the positive word-of-mouth, the amount of orders hadn’t grown by much. Buyers still wanted to hear more experiences from those who owned and piloted the physical copies of the mech.
"They’ll have to wait for a long time, since as far as I know, every bidder who won a mech at the auctions are pure collectors."
These types of people cared a lot about the condition of their mechs. The newer, the better. It would be best if the mechs hadn’t been piloted at all since they passed their testing phases.
It would be impossible for them to show off their new purchases by sticking a pilot into their cockpits and increase the wear and tear of the mech by skipping around.
In any case, Ves wouldn’t have to deal with this issues very soon. Instead, he needed to report for duty.
He entered an armored shuttle and directed it to bring him towards a processing center of the Mech Corps in the outskirts of Dorum. After a short amount of time, the shuttle and its escorts settled down onto a massive parking space that hosted hundreds of shuttle.
As Ves exited the vehicle, he took in the din of conversation and realized that he hadn’t arrived as early as he thought. Many other mech designers had already packed their bags and waited for the moment the Mech Corps called up the second wave.
His comm beeped as it received an automated message from the processing center. They sent him a map of the processing center and his schedule for the next couple of days.
"Looks like I’ve got a lot of inspections to go through."
Ves sounded a little worried because his body and mind was nothing like a baseline human. Even though the Bright Republic must have noted down his abnormalities, it would still raise some eyebrows with the Mech Corps he thought.
At this stage, a lot of mech designers already arrived. Ves took a casual glance of the people disembarking from their shuttles and aircars and guessed that most of them consisted of Apprentices and Journeymen.
Ves easily distinguished the latter from their attitude, body language and privileges. They treated obvious Apprentices like air and only held an equal conversation with other Journeymen.
To be sure, Journeyman Mech Designers enjoyed a lot more prestige because it was at this point that the mech industry regarded them as fully competent mech designers. Before advancing to this rank, mech designers still possessed a lot of holes in their knowledge base and couldn’t fully guarantee the soundness of their designs.
In contrast, regardless of the person involved, any Journeyman Mech Designer who received formal recognition from the MTA could be counted on to deliver battleworthy mechs. Their designs covered every base, and often carried something extra in order to distinguish their products from others.
This was why even if the LMC reached the point of selling thousands of mechs, the industry still regarded it as a small-time player. His low rank hobbled the reputation of his designs. He could forget about conquering a significant share of the mech market as long as his status remained the same.
"I still have a lot of work ahead of myself in order to reach their heights."
Most Journeyman Mech Designers looked to be in their middle ages, though it was hard to guess due to the use of age-prolonging treatments. Many Journeymen enjoyed enough success to be able to afford the most preliminary suite of treatments that stretched out their aging process. They couldn’t get back their youth, but the time of their natural deaths could still be extended by at least a century.
People who enjoyed age-prolonging treatments couldn’t be distinguished from a baseline human unless they exhibited some characteristic traits. Most of the time, their behavior could be described as wearing a young skin, but acting like an old person.
Ves only rarely saw so many people who behaved in this manner before. Age-prolonging treatments was something that was out of the hands of the general public. Even the Larkinson Estate couldn’t afford to provide any treatments to their most famous family members such as Grandpa Benjamin or Uncle Ark.
This was also one of the shortcomings of age-prolonging technology. Ves didn’t understand the science behind it all, but it was generally known that it took a lot more effort to extend the lives of a potentate or mech pilot.
Their brains operated in a different manner from the brains of baseline humans. Theirs was much more active and in fact wore out a little faster. Age-prolonging treatments needed to be calibrated very specifically to accommodate the unique brains of every mech pilot.
The higher their rank, the bigger the challenge.
The Bright Republic at its current state simply couldn’t afford to subsidize any age-prolonging treatments for their expert pilots. This actually led to a lot of them to pack up their bags and emigrate to the Friday Coalition or some other powerful state in a different star sector. The amount of expert pilots who stuck with the Bright Republic was very little.
Naturally, these expert pilots wouldn’t necessarily have a good time in their new homes, and it wasn’t as if the Mech Corps possessed no means of retaining some of them. Usually, they signed contracts with talented pilots that stated that if they happened to advance to expert pilot while in active duty, that they still needed to serve the end of their terms before they could go.
This illustrated the disparity in treatment between different ranks. Even if the Bright Republic didn’t possess enough means to please all of their talents, they sure tried their best to accommodate them. Ves witnessed the differences first-hand.
Whereas Ves only received a message on his comm and a projected AI as his guide, junior officers personally received every incoming Journeyman. They would quickly be led to a smaller building off to the side that nonetheless looked more luxurious.
"Some day, I’ll retreat the same kind of treatment." Ves shrugged and continued to follow the blinking projected ball that led him across the parking area and towards a large hangar-like structure.
Inside the cavernous walls, large amounts of mech designers lined up to report for duty and to go through their first inspections.
Despite the enormous lines, Ves moved forward rather quickly. The Mech Corps didn’t choose to conduct their business inside this giant hangar for nothing. Once Ves arrived at the front, a bland-looking serviceman checked his identity and signed off on a whole stack of virtual documents.
"Sign here to acknowledge that you understand the rules and regulations of the Mech Corps, and that you cannot use ignorance of these regulations as an excuse."
"Sign here to confirm you agree with the secrecy clauses. The Mech Corps takes confidentiality and information security with the highest level of importance. Report immediately if you carry any electronic or biological implants, no matter how small or unrelated they might be to spying activities."
Ves dutifully noted some of the abnormalities in his body, most notably the Jutland organ. Even if the Mech Corps likely knew all of this before, he couldn’t afford to slip up right at the start.
"Note down the possible conflicts of interest that might occur during your service time. Be as detailed as possible, and include both foreign and domestic influences."
"Sign here to consent to invasive health checks. The Mech Corps reserves the right to unilaterally operate and modify your body and its physiological functions without needing to adhere to any medical justifications."
"Sign here to state that during your service, you will put the interests of the Bright Republic over the interests of any other state or comparable entity. In case of a conflict of interests, you should immediately report it to your superiors."
By the time Ves biometrically signed the twenty-odd documents, his fingers almost cramped up. Some organizations were content with scanning the DNA or the pupils of a person, but the Mech Corps adhered to a much more rigorous standard.
The sheer amount of actions Ves needed to do to sign each document was a struggle in itself. The Mech Corps was determined to prevent any mech designers from committing fraud or misrepresenting the truth.
Ves understood why, of course. Mech designers primarily designed mechs, but were capable engineers as well. They used to pull off all kinds of tricks, from hacking the devices that held the virtual documents and changing their clauses, to putting forth a remote-controlled android to serve in their stead.
The most extreme example actually consisted of a spoiled brat who ordered the kidnapping of another mech designer. Gruesome surgery turned the victim’s body into a clone of the spoiled brat, while extremely brutal brainwashing slowly turned his personality into a passable imitation of the mastermind.
The entire scheme actually stood a good chance of working because the Mech Corps didn’t perform invasive inspections back then. The doppelganger dutifully pretended to be someone else and while some may have held some suspicions, no one realized the truth.
The only reason why it fell through was because the spoiled brat showed himself in public when one of his parties went out of control. People quickly started to scratch their heads why this good-for-nothing mech designer could be in two places at once. Wasn’t he working on debugging mechs in some isolated research base?
"Go on ahead and wait for inspection."
Ves moved on and followed the guide to a closed-off modular clinic. Throughout the rest of the day, he went through an extensive amount of tests. Due to his abnormal body, he enjoyed increased scrutiny and had to endure a lot more tests despite the existence of records that told the exact same story.
"We just want to be sure we got the right person." A doctor muttered when Ves asked why.
The Mech Corps wasn’t interested in the potentially miraculous effects of his Jutland organ. Instead, they held a lot of concern about its unknown functioning and the intentions of its creator. Who knew what kind of biological programming it contained.
Ves came across the first obstacle then and there.
"You’ll have to stay back, Mr. Larkinson." The doctor said as he furrowed at the inconclusive results in the reports. "We can let you go through the next steps of your initiation until we have received some assurances that you aren’t carrying anything that might prove to be a detriment."
Ves expected that something like this might happen. "I can refer you to Master Olson’s representative. He can vouch for me."
"That will help a lot!"
In cases like this where the Mech Corps lacked the means to resolve the issue, they would normally hold back the mech designer in question and dither on their assignments. Ves wanted to avoid such an awful fate, so he already prepared something beforehand.
He raised his comm and sent out the contact details for Horatio. "This is the contact for Master Olson’s steward. He takes care of all her administrative issues and knows about my situation."
The doctor retreated and corresponded with Horatio. Ves couldn’t eavesdrop on their conversation, but he had no doubt that the most contentious issues would be waved away.
After all, Ves was not the only mech designer here with connections to a foreign state. The Friday Coalition was a behemoth compared to the Republic, so the latter had no choice but to swallow every pill served in its mouth.
Some time later, the doctor returned and wordlessly nodded his head at Ves to move onwards.
"Thanks."
Although the experience was a little awkward, and the Mech Corps would never fully trust him, Ves knew that he had cleared the most essential hurdle.
He went through a final inspection where some bots stripped all of his clothes and belongings and issued him a bland, grey replacement outfit along with the most primitive comm he had ever seen.
"This thing doesn’t even have a single app installed besides a clock."
After that, Ves reached a dormitory area where a handful of mech designers bunked inside small modular rooms erected for the purpose. He entered a room only to meet three unfamiliar faces.
"Look at what we have here! The latecomer has arrived!"
"Took you long enough!"
"You missed dinner, but we saved some for you."
Ves smiled and went inside and took a seat at the square table in the middle. "Thank you, I’m starving."
Dinner in this case consisted of nothing more than a bland, stale nutrient pack along with lots of water to hydrate his stomach.
"Is this it?" Ves frowned. "It looks rather... bare."
Even prisoners got to enjoy reconstituted food that used nutrient packs as raw materials. Serving the dry bars of unidentifiable biological matter without any processing was jokingly considered as a borderline war crime. He introduced himself as Morgan Hollenfield.
One of the three mech designers sighed. He was a middle-aged man with dark brown hair and looked a lot older than the other two.
"The Mech Corps wants to show who’s boss around here. We only get to enjoy the nutrient packs as breakfast, lunch and dinner until we go through what they call their lightest version of boot camp."
Everyone frowned at that. As a rule, mech designers were nerds and geeks. What did physical fitness have to do with how well they designed their mechs?
"It’s another way to put us down!" A younger man burst out. "Those jumped-up mech pilots always think they are in charge, and want to drive in the point that we are their slaves!"
Morgan quickly pressed the young man’s shoulder. "Calm down, Jim! The Mech Corps is always listening in! You can land yourself in a lot of trouble if you talk like that!"
"As if I care! I had a good career lined up and several designs in the works. I wasn’t supposed to be called up!"
Morgan awkwardly laughed at Ves and the other mech designer. "Don’t mind Jim too much. He’s a scion of the Ronan Family."
That caused Ves to widen his eyes a bit. The Ronan Family owned a lot of asteroid mining operations. They weren’t a big player in the resource market, but carved out a niche spot for themselves.
Jim probably enjoyed a lot of benefits if he was related to that Ronan Family. His company would be able to incur much less costs to produce a mech if it took advantage of raw materials being sold to it at cost price.
However, to Ves, Jim didn’t look as if he enjoyed that much success. He looked a bit pathetic compared to the final mech designer.
The young man noticed the inquisitive stare and held out his hand to Ves. "Bartholomew Yi. Apprentice Mech Designer. Just call me Bart for short."
The man’s appearance only showed a hint of asian characteristics, so that side of his bloodline must have thinned out a bit through the generations.
"Ves Larkinson, also an Apprentice Mech Designer."
All four were obviously Apprentices with their own pride and accomplishments, so nobody treat each other as anything but equals. Ves may have designed some great mechs and enjoyed the backing of an influential Master from the Coalition, but the others didn’t lose out too much in their own careers.
As Ves gradually consumed the nutrient packs, he got to know his three new roommates.
"I’ve designed fifteen original designs in my career." Morgan proudly boasted. "Though they haven’t won any awards, all of them turned out a handsome profit."
"What type of mechs did you design?" Ves asked as he tried to swallow another bite of dry nutrients.
"Oh, they run the gamut from light mechs to medium mechs, skirmishers to knights, landbound mechs to aerial mechs. The only kind of mechs I can’t design are spaceborn, aquatic and heavy mechs."
"That’s... a really wide range of mechs." Ves said, a little stunned.
It wasn’t unheard of for mech designers to design a broad sweep of mech types. However, Ves always learned that mech designers needed to apply some focus, especially in the formative stages of Novice and Apprentice.
Scattering too much at such an early phase risked stalling a mech designer’s development in developing his own style and design philosophy.
From the askance looks that Jim and Bart directed to Morgan, they must have thought the same.
"I know what you’re thinking." Morgan replied, demonstrating his self-awareness. "Your reactions are just like everyone else who hears about my record, but hear me out. What if, I’m on the right track, and you guys are dead wrong?"
"That’s impossible!" Jim erupted after smacking his palm against the tabletop. "Who’s ever heard of an Apprentice advancing to Journeyman by designing every type of mech in the galaxy? Even if you have the lifespan to complete all of those designs, your focus is so diluted that there’s hardly any style to speak of!"
Ves nodded in agreement. He held the same opinions as Jim, blunt as he might be.
"That’s where the entire mech designer community is wrong." Morgan grinned and crossed his arms while leaning back. "Admittedly, some of you may advance to Journeyman in the next decade or two. That’s okay. Mech design is not a race. Just keep in mind that you’ll regret it for the rest of your lives if you move on so fast without rounding out your experience."
"Why so?"
"Because mech design is all about reaching the pinnacle in mech design! Think about it. How can you reach the top when you skimped out in your foundational stages? The moment you advance to Journeyman after designing only five to ten or so mechs, you are progressing on top of an unstable foundation."
"What constitutes an unstable foundation?" Bart furrowed his brows. Unlike Jim, he appeared to be more interested in Morgan’s theory. "My mentor has taught me that a good foundation consists of a comprehensive understanding of the sciences related to mech design."
Morgan raised a finger. "That’s only one part of the equation! Don’t forget that to become a Journeyman, you need to be more than a good learner. The other two requirements are to design several original mechs and to develop your own design philosophy. In truth, the design philosophy is connected to the other two criteria. It’s the goal that every Apprentice is aiming for, and it happens to be the part which everyone is trying to rush through!"
"That’s nonsense." Jim retorted. "Most of the Master Mech Designers today are geniuses who advanced rapidly through the ranks. The faster they reach Master, the brighter their future! Anyone who took more than a hundred years to reach that exalted rank has no future at all."
"You’re wrong! Rushing through the Apprentice stage is as if you are building a starship with no FTL drive! Sure, you can still build a decent ship without it with fully functional power reactors and thrusters. This is enough to drive the starship from planet to planet within a single star system. However, the moment you want to jump into FTL in order to reach a better star system, you will suddenly find yourself coming up short, because you forgot to install the FTL drive at the construction phase!"
The analogy sounded really compelling, but none of the other three designers looked convinced.
"Mech design isn’t anything like building a starship." Ves calmly replied. "As Jim has said, many Master Mech Designers seem fine even if they only spent a couple of years as Apprentices."
Enough hard proof existed on the galactic net to prove his assertions.
"Oh sure, those Masters all seem impressive trying to outrace each other." Morgan waved their accomplishments away as if they were nothing. "To me, they’re like toddlers running around in the sandbox. Is Master Mech Designer the end point of our careers? No! Above Masters, there are Star Designers!"
Star Designers! These were the true pinnacles of mech design in the galaxy. Legendary figures like the Armorer and the Polymath worked with the most cutting-edge technologies available to humankind in order to push the envelope of what mechs became capable of achieving.
"What do Star Designers have to do with your theory?"
"If you’ve read their biographies, then you should know that none of them started out as geniuses. Except for the Polymath, but she’s a weird one. Aside from her, everyone else started off like you and me. Average. They were dullards even. They lingered in the Apprentice phase for decades before they advanced to Journeymen. Instead of regarding those periods as their lowest point, perhaps they are actually the secrets to their success!"
Jim and Bart looked stunned at Morgan. However, Ves did not appear to be convinced. "There’s a very big hole in your theory. The other Star Designers might have stalled in the Apprentice stage, but they haven’t branched out in their design work."
The hierarchy among mech designers looked like a very fat and short pyramid. Novices were as abundant as red dwarfs in the galaxy.
Only a fraction of them reached the Apprentice-level, but anyone could advance to this stage as long as they studied hard and received some opportunities.
Reaching Journeyman Mech Designer was a watershed. Many tried but failed to reach this rank despite all the effort they put in their development.
Ves did not have a good clue what it took to reach Senior and Master-level, but it must have been accompanied by extremely stringent demands, because less than one per mille of mech designers in the preceding ranks managed to break through.
As for reaching the rank that went beyond Master, most people didn’t dare to dream about it. Even though enough Masters existed in the galaxy to fill up an entire planet, only the MTA only recognized seventy-or-so Star Designers.
Perhaps a few more Star Designers existed who hadn’t made themselves known, but by and large there shouldn’t be more than a hundred of them across all of humanity.
Their power and influence transcended states. At that stage, even the first-rate superstates treaded lightly around them. Many Star Designers renounced their former loyalties and became independent entities that worked for the common good of mankind.
It could be said that Star Designers transcended their former bonds and shackles and have reached a level of existence on par with god pilots. Both types of humans formed the absolute best of what humanity had to offer and were worshipped by trillions of humans.
Low-ranked mech designers like Ves, Bart and Jim constantly thought about how to reach Journeyman-level. It was way too soon to even think about advancing to Star Designer, but Morgan amazingly already thought about a strategy to reach this supreme existence.
Although Morgan’s theory sounded logical, Ves read the same biographies as well. They were mandatory reading in school. Every mech designer should have read at least a dozen different biographies.
"Star Designers emerged through chance, opportunity and coincidence." Ves explained the common understanding on Star Designers. "Many geniuses who have quickly reached the Master stage have never been able to touch upon the threshold to the next rank. Although we don’t know why that is so, no one has ever told us it’s due to a supposedly ’bad’ foundation. Besides, if the only way to get a good foundation is to linger in the Apprentice stage for hundreds of years, then the galaxy would be flooded with Masters right now."
Morgan instantly shook his head. "Ves, my friend, I thought you looked smart, but you fell into this trap as well. Just think for one second about the biographies you’ve read. Is all of it true?"
That caused everyone at the table to blink. Certainly they told the truth, right?
"Why would they lie?"
"Why won’t they lie? Those biographies read like fairy tales or adventure novels! Do you really think those Star Designers went through all that nonsense and transformed into strange existences that has turned them into something special? It’s all drivel fed to the masses in order to keep the upper echelon in power!"
Morgan continued to rant about his assertions for a couple minutes. Ves, Jim and Bart all looked at each other with perplexed smiles.
Ves couldn’t take it any longer. "It’s all well and good to state that the biographies are fictional, but what are their true stories? Just because the early days of those Star Designers don’t conform to what is being told in the books, that doesn’t mean they adhered to your theories either. You have no proof."
"That’s because they’re keeping it all a secret! It’s a conspiracy against nobodies like us!"
The man could claim all he wanted, but nobody else bought his shtick. After finishing his bland dinner, the rest of them tried to move on from this topic. Ves got to know about his other two bunkmates.
"I’ve never gone to any universities or institutions." Bartholomew Yi began. "My father is a mech designer as well and he believes he can teach me a lot better than any school in the Republic."
"So you learned everything you knew from your dad?"
"Correct. I even joined his design team and assisted in developing a couple of his models. They all worked out well. The experience gave me enough confidence to design my mechs."
"Did you start your own company or are you working for dad?"
"The latter. There’s no point in starting up a seperate company if I’ll eventually inherit my dad’s existing company."
Bart’s story sounded fairly typical. A small but substantial portion of mech designers learned the craft from their parents. Such a teaching method was even more intimate than apprenticing to a Master, because one’s father or mother always taught their descendents with utmost care and attention.
That said, the mech industry as a whole looked down on homeschooling. Mech designers who learned from their parents and no one else often ended up as pale imitations of their parents. They knew the theories and could replicate a past work, but when it came to applying their knowledge to develop new designs, that was where most of them fell short.
Ves didn’t say anything about that to Bart. He didn’t want to piss the homeschooled mech designer off.
"How many mechs have you designed?"
"Not much, only four. Like my father, I specialize in spaceborn mechs."
"That’s more than than me. I only have two original designs under my belt, and my second design only came out recently. What about you, Jim?"
"Hm, I only designed one original mech, a nice little light mech. I’m still taking it slow."
It turned out Jim’s design hadn’t caught on in the market. The disappointing sales figures burdened his company with losses, which forced him to crawl back to the Ronan Family for some money to tide his company over.
Naturally, Jim didn’t sound so pathetic when he meandered through his story, but Ves was sharp enough to pick out the truth.
"What were you working on as your second design?"
"It doesn’t matter anymore." Jim sighed. "This war has made everything moot. My company will certainly be shuttered without my presence. I’ll have to figure something out once the Mech Corps releases me."
Out of everyone in this room, Jim appeared to be the least successful mech designer. Ves got the sense that he had barely made any progress since reaching Apprentice.
Even Morgan possessed a better track record, though that could also be accounted to his age. The older man truly designed a substantial amount of mechs, each one better than the last one, though none of them ever sold more than a couple of thousand copies each.
As they got to know each other, they realized that besides their rank, they had very little in common.
Morgan possessed the most experience by far, but his insane theories caused him to stall in his progression.
Jim achieved the least success, but he could draw on a lot of help from the Ronan Family, either through paying less for raw materials or through direct cash infusions.
Bart grew up in a comfortable environment, having everything handed to him with a silver spoon.
As for Ves, though he only published two designs, he built up everything on his own, though he conveniently left out the role the System played in his rapid ascension.
This caused the group’s dynamics to shift. Jim’s perpetual resentfulness made him a hard person to befriend, while Bart’s easygoing ways reflected his lack of struggle.
Morgan shifted to become their unofficial leader in a way. No matter what they thought about his beliefs, it couldn’t be denied that he really designed over a dozen different original designs. Such an accomplishment deserved recognition.
As for Ves, he fell somewhere in the middle. He was actually the youngest of the group and possessed very little practical experience compared to the others. Yet even Bart spend years to advance from Novice to Apprentice whereas Ves only took a couple of months.
Out of the three young men in the room, Ves burned the brightest and held the most potential. The only reason why the others didn’t regard him higher was the fact that he possessed a complicated backing.
In truth, Ves got the sense that everyone felt envious at him for catching the attention of a Master Mech Designer. It made them regard him as a competitor more than a possible friend.
The distance suited him fine. Ves held many secrets, and he wasn’t eager to let anyone get too close. Not when he couldn’t protect himself in the event he slipped up.
"What’s it like to apprentice under a Master?" Morgan asked with some curiosity in his face. "My mentor is only a local Senior Mech Designer, so I’ve never seen a Master in the flesh. Are they truly magical?"
Ves thought back on the Leemar Open Competition that took place so long ago and refreshed his impressions of the Masters that sat on those tall pedestals.
"They are every bit as impressive as you think. They look human, but inside they are biological weapons dedicated solely to designing some of the best mechs in the galaxy. You simply can’t relax around any of them at close proximity."
When Ves personally met with Master Olson, he felt as if he entered a zone in which his judgement became a little fuddled. Back then, he hadn’t noticed any discrepancies, but looking back on it made him suspect that being in the presence of a Master affected him in many subtle ways.
He couldn’t really tell what kind of influence Master Olson exerted around her, so Ves somewhat doubted whether it was simply a combination of apprehension and admiration at seeing a Master up close.
Morgan sighed. "I wouldn’t have the guts to try my luck in Leemar. The Friday Coalition looks down on mech designers that arrived from the boonies. It’s truly unfair for us."
"That’s the way the galaxy works." Jim added with a bit of sageness in his voice. "People who are born in the galactic center have it best. Anyone else are country bumpkins in their eyes. Even the rulers of the Friday Coalition are nothing more than a bunch of ants in front of a lowly security officer from the galactic center."
This was the eternal sorrow for those born in the galactic rim. The circumstances of their birth sealed their fate before they could even learn their first words. The galactic center was unimaginably dense and wealthy, but it couldn’t afford to subsidize the development of the outer galaxy.
Ves found this turn of conversation to be too depressing. "Our starting points are different from the mech designer who enjoy an abundance of privileges that they take for granted. However, the galactic rim isn’t too far behind in pumping out Masters. It takes more than wealth to improve."
That gave them a ray of hope again, though Morgan looked about to repeat his theories on maximizing the chances of reaching Star Designer. Everyone else quickly raised another to forestall his story, thereby avoiding another crisis.
After a couple of hours of relaxing and occasional chitchat, they retired for the night. As Ves tried to lie comfortably on his stiff, cold bed, Ves thought back on Morgan’s explanation.
Despite clashing with most of the contents of the biographies of Star Designer, his theory looked like it made a lot of sense.
"Am I walking down the wrong road right now?"
The mech industry placed a lot of attention on talent and potential. Those who advanced faster than others would be considered talents, while those who muddled through and reached Journeyman-level in their fifties were regarded as people who would soon reach a dead end.
The reason why the mech industry placed so much importance on speed was because it indicated that this person had a lot more in store. It was extremely expensive for influences to nurture a Master, and it might not even work!
"Should I change my plans?"
Previously, Ves thought about doing the bare minimum in his Apprentice stage. Once he designed three more mechs, he’d be able to tick another box.
No matter how many times Ves tried to dismiss Morgan’s ranting, he mind constantly drifted back at some of his assertions. The older mech designer’s belief that you need to design more mechs than five to develop a proper foundation sounded very attractive to Ves.
Well, it wasn’t as if he’d be able to design a mech while he served in the Mech Corps. "I’ll think about it later."
The next days, the Mech Corps began to perform a lot of tests. They wanted to know everything about the capabilities of their mech designers.
Physical tests only formed the start of it. Due to his endowments, Ves breezed through examinations that sought to test his strength or endurance. However, once he moved on to examinations that tested his coordination and how well he played certain sports, he fell flat on his face due to a lack of practice.
His strange performance instantly distinguished him among the crowd of hundreds of mech designers in training unit. Even his bunkmates had to reassess his existence.
"Why are you such a freak, Ves?" Bart asked with goggling eyes.
"Bad luck from a mission gone wrong at the frontier."
"Wow, if can call that back luck, then you are more than welcome to pass it over to us!"
"Haha! I wish. It’s mostly my own fault for accepting the mission in the first place."
Besides finding out their physical limits, the processing center also stressed out their cognitive limits. The entire training unit went from examination to examination where they needed to perform specific actions such as memorizing as much pages of a random book in a short amount of time.
While performing a single test wasn’t that big of a deal, the Mech Corps seemed keen on carting them off from test to test without any time to rest. This quickly led to a lot of protests from many mech designers.
"Our treatment here is outright disrespectful!"
"Are we training to become commandos or something?! I’m almost falling apart at the seams!"
They mostly complained at empty air, as the Mech Corps never sent out any human face to conduct the tests. Instead, they relied on bots and projections to corral the mech designers as if they were guinea pigs.
The strange methods all added to the illusion that they somehow ended up in a prison instead of a training center.
A lot of mech designers carelessly uttered their frustration at the inane treatment they received. Many of the Apprentice Mech Designers who got called up in the second wave all enjoyed a certain amount of success in their careers.
They expected to be treated with a measure of respect. Instead, the processing center went out of its way to make their lives more difficult.
A lot of mech designers attributed this behavior to the mech pilot-centric focus of the Mech Corps and the wider society.
Only a handful of people such as Ves knew the truth. As a Larkinson, Ves already possessed a lot of awareness on how the Mech Corps worked.
The grumbling of the mech designers couldn’t compare to the harsh training every mech pilot endured before they were allowed to enter the cockpit. To Ves, they acted like a bunch of babies.
Out of his bunkmates, only Morgan appeared to be aware as well. "They want to break us down and shave off some of our egos. Who among us doesn’t possess a net worth of at least a couple of hundred million credits? It would be hell if they put us all in a base without attempting to adjust our attitude."
Ves nodded. "It’s more than that. It’s pretty clear that Journeymen are receiving different treatment from us. They’re probably being groomed in a different way, possibly to lead over juniors like us."
Even if they knew what went on, it wasn’t as if they could become immune to the constant manipulation. Humans didn’t work that way. Attitude and behavior came from the mind and body. Both could be manipulated in a million different ways.
If some smart alecs thought they could endure the annoyances without becoming affected, they had another thing coming.
Over the next couple of weeks, Ves and the others finished their tests and moved on to actual training. Each mech designer trained together but received individual goals they needed to achieve by the end of the training session.
Failure to comply led to very severe punishments.
Ves pretty much fell into the illusion that he went through a boot camp. The exercises pushed him harder than anyone else. Where as one person only needed to lift a boulder the size of a child, Ves had to lift a boulder the size of an adult.
The training program also sought to push the limits of his cognitive functions. His exercises would be ten times harder than anyone else. Sometimes, the disparity would be even wider.
His superhuman intelligence caused him to excel in brute force cognitive functions such as memorizing a raft of texts or performing mental calculations that might have stumped an average mathematics professor.
Ves also seemed to excel in more creative aspects such as sketching out a mech described in a single page that was filled with abstract words. His ability to visualize a mech from vague and fanciful concepts actually caused others to look like him as if he was a freak.
"Ves Larkinson is a monster. He simply isn’t human!"
"Don’t get close to that freak.A single handshake of his will break every bone in your hand!"
"Do you think he prefers tall women? Drat, if I knew a hunk like him was here, I would have undergone a treatment to shorten my stature!"
It came without saying that Ves did not enjoy all the attention he was getting from the training unit. While some of the mech designers exhibited exceptional cognitive functions, they couldn’t be compared to his own abilities. On top of that, he also possessed an abnormally strong physique.
As his performance became increasingly exceptional, his bunkmates started to distance themselves from him. No longer could Ves walk up to them as an equal and talk about what they thought about mechs.
Even Morgan admitted his inferiority in front of Ves. In his mind, though he would certainly be having the last laugh, he should do his best to keep his head down while he was weak.
"It must be really nice to have a Master looking over your development." Jim sullenly said after a brutal round of training one day. All of them felt physically and mentally exhausted. "She must have stuffed you with all of the latest genetic boosts. How many did you get?!"
Ves frowned as he lay on top of his bunk. He was in no mood to argue. "I only got one. As I mentioned before, all of my other changes are a result of my own actions. There are many wondrous things in the frontier. It’s dangerous to wander outside of human space, but that’s exactly where the last treasures of the galaxy reside."
"You’re hiding something!" Jim burst out and pulled himself into a sitting position on his bunk. "I heard from the others that you shouldn’t have even passed through the first inspections! You only got through because you ran to mommy for help!"
"Now that was uncalled for!" Ves barked back. Using that particular word in that manner wore down his patience. "I won’t deny your words, because it’s true, but what does it matter? I came here to do the same thing that everyone else is doing. I am here to serve the Republic."
"Hahaha! Keep your stupid drivel to yourself! All I’m seeing is someone who is better than us trying to act like he’s one of us. Let me tell you, it’s useless! You trying to fit in with us is like a wolf pretending to be a sheep among a herd. The only ending that’s in store for us is you putting all of us down!"
Ves did not get angry at Jim’s outburst. Everyone was tired, and some even held a lot of accumulated resentment. In these kinds of situations, people often said things they didn’t really wish to express if they possessed a sober mind.
His mother taught him to avoid such arguments by not getting into them. Therefore, Ves merely rolled around in his bunk and tried to go to sleep.
Unfortunately, Jim took that as an affront. "Are you ignoring me, Ves? Answer me! Why are you here!?"
His raised voice caused the other two bunkmates to add their own voices.
"Shut up, Jim." Bart wearily frowned. "Ves is on a different level than us. That’s got nothing to do with us."
Morgan held a very different opinion. "You know, maybe Jim is on to something. I keep thinking why Ves is slumming it out with mortal men like us. Then I realized the truth. He’s not an Apprentice Mech Designer. He’s a Journeyman!"
His outburst caused the other three to jump. What?!
"Think about it! In every single exercise that the Mech Corps is subjecting us to, he’s head and shoulders above the rest. He’s beating us up so badly that even our mothers can’t recognize us anymore! A monster like Ves fits in more with Journeymen than Apprentices!"
"B-B-But-But-But Ves only started designing mechs two years ago! How could he jump from Novice to Journeyman in that time?!"
"Do you really need to think about it? A Master Mech Designer is capable of doing anything as long as she’s willing to spend a lot of resources. My take is that Ves has a ’special’ relationship with Master Olson, if you know what I mean."
"That’s slanderous!" Ves retorted back to Morgan. He felt obliged to defend Master Olson’s honor. "My relationship with my Master has always been cordial and proper!"
"Says the boytoy!" Jim taunted to Ves. "I don’t know how a hick like you got lucky and caught the old hag’s eyes, but you aren’t a real mech designer! All your achievements are due to the gifts you received! You never accomplished anything by yourself!"
This impacted Ves a lot more than he thought. He felt deeply affronted by the way that this loser of a mech designer accused him of having everything handed to him. Even if he benefited from the System his father had left him, the thing hardly allowed Ves to breeze through the ranks. He worked hard to get to this point!
"Really, it’s obvious now that I realize it." Morgan uttered as he pointed an accusing finger at Ves. "The only reason why the people upstairs placed here is because you’re here to stir us up! Smearing all of our faces with your inhuman level of performance is another form of torture to us!"
Jim cursed and jumped to his feet. "Bastard! Go back to your masters and tell them to sod off!"
Before Ves could utter a defense, Jim bolted towards the bunk where Ves was resting on with remarkable haste. His exhaustion didn’t seem to be a factor as his outburst lent him a lot of strength.
"Get off me!"
Jim started to punch, kick and claw at Ves. It might have been very severe if not for his pathetic amount of strength.
His attacks did nothing to Ves. His body was like a sponge that absorbed Jim’s mindless attacks as if it soaked up water.
Though Ves really wanted to punch Jim in the face, he withheld his body and remained on the defensive. He already knew what would happen next.
A loud tone sounded out in the room. Moments later, a massive electric shock ran through all four occupants. Even Ves became paralyzed, in part because the shock mainly targeted at his nerves, which still remained fairly vulnerable.
The shock succeeded in stopping Jim from lashing out. His body shook and shivered as his body completely went out of control.
Half a minute later, the door opened and a couple of black-coated armored bots hovered in. They clawed at Jim who was sprawled on the floor and hauled him out like a sack of meat.
The door closed and locked after the departure, leaving the remaining three occupants to deal with the after-effects of the shock attack.
Ves was really beginning to hate this experience. He had a feeling Jim wouldn’t be the last designer to be carted off.
After that day, reality started to sink in the mech designers. Even the most ignorant among them learned that the Mech Corps did not care about their status and their achievements. No matter how many mechs they designed or how many pilots used their products, everyone started from scratch.
The ongoing pressure from the exercises and the inhuman way the processing center treated the mech designer really took a toll on everyone. No one had the time to smile and chat with each other. They needed to conserve every available moment to rest and regain their strength.
This suited Ves fine. By now, his alienation among the other mech designers reached the furthest point it could go. The only reason why his status as a pariah didn’t bother him was because the mech designers didn’t treat their closest friends that differently. The constant frustration and exhaustion sent everyone into a pit of self-wallowing isolation. Everyone was too numb to do anything more.
It was at this point that the training regime started to move beyond senseless exercises. They entered classrooms which served them with images of the Bright Republic.
A pair of bedraggled mech pilots leaning against a wrecked mech.
A city bombed to oblivion, only to be rebuilt anew.
An enormous fleet carrier surrounded by a flotilla of combat carriers orbiting around a glittering planet.
Throughout the inspirational visuals, it repeated a constant refrain.
"We are the bastion of reason."
"We are the torch that lights up the end of the galaxy."
"We are all that stand in the way between freedom and tyranny."
In their tired states, most mech designers soaked up the message without resistance. Ves on the other hand possessed a much more potent recovery speed, so he remained very aware throughout these indoctrination sessions.
Frankly, he didn’t know what to think either. Most of the footage sounded inspirational, but to Ves they largely fell flat. He already possessed a lot of attachment to the Republic and hardly needed any reinforcement in that area.
Along with indoctrination, the mech designers also started to learn other necessities. They memorized the hierarchy of the Mech Corps, how they should behave among themselves and to the servicemen of the Mech Corps, and what they needed to do if they ever fell into a precarious situation.
It became clear to Ves that the Mech Corps explicitly didn’t train them to be servicemen. They didn’t fit in the usual hierarchy. Instead, mech designers took on an auxiliary role that existed apart from any existing bureau.
They weren’t taught how to handle a weapon, nor did they need to salute to any officers. Instead, they learned how the design teams of the Mech Corps worked and in what place they fit in. They learned the many different roles mech designers played and how their work impacted the regiments that made use of the designs.
"The war between the Bright Republic and the Vesia Kingdom is a conflict that is fought with mechs. It is vitally important that the mech pilots fighting on the frontline have access to the latest designs. Each mech model possesses their own strengths and weaknesses. Once a vulnerability is known by the enemy, that model loses its advantage on the battlefield."
Regiments constantly demanded new designs to replenish their wrecked mechs and become less vulnerable to the known faults of their current designs.
"Your only role is to assist the lead designer and his main assistants in optimizing their designs. It is not your responsibility to suggest new features or perform additional changes to the design."
The lessons hammered home that as Apprentices, they possessed no right to speak in front of a room filled with Journeymen and Seniors.
Ves really chafed at that restriction. The lessons obviously aimed to turn them into obedient cogs in a giant design machine. Instead of being able to design a part or suggest some modifications to an existing design, the Mech Corps only expected them to perform grunt jobs.
He distinctly felt his competences should have elevated him to a greater role. Too bad no one cared.
Two months went by in this vein. The training program superficially molded them in a way that allowed them to seamlessly slot into any working design team.
After the end of their training program, hundreds of mech designers assembled into neat ranks at an open area. As Ves discretely glanced around, he found that many mech designers looked as if they lost their spirit.
Even the likes of Morgan and Bart adopted the same numb expressions. Both of them dealt with the pressure in slightly different ways. Morgan developed a tendency to mutter to himself to sleep while Bart often needed to pace around in their dorm before collapsing into sleep.
Throughout it all, the mech designers hardly spoke with each other in whatever free time the schedule granted them. Ves hadn’t spoken anything aloud in weeks.
At this moment, they heard footsteps. A pair of hard boots clattered forward as a uniformed officer of the Mech Corps strode to the front of the assembly.
"Mech designers of the Republic. Your two-month training program is at an end." The man immediately began. "Seventeen of you have been declared unfit and are now serving out their penalties."
The crowd cared little about the likes of Jim and a couple of other mech designers who broke down and went crazy. They just craved to return to a somewhat normal society. The arrival of another human being actually provided mental succor to the deprived mech designers.
"The war waits for no one. Although your training program should have been much more extensive, the fighting at the frontlines has heated up. The Republic needs you you serve your state. Are you willing to bear the torch?"
Everyone automatically raised their arms as if they held up a torch and roared a resounding cry.
"Good." The officer nodded. "Your new assignments await. I bid you good luck and hope your work will help save the lives of our pilots at the front."
After that, they enjoyed their first period of rest and relaxation in a very long time. With no expectations being thrust upon their shoulders, they looked around with clueless expressions.
Moments later, they received a new set of documents in their military-issued comms. Ves activated the device and skimmed through their contents.
They turned out to be his new orders.
"Is that it? Is this really the end?"
Some of the mech designers broke their stoic exteriors upon realizing that they no longer needed to go through what they considered to be the equivalent of torture. They were more than ready to move on from this horrible place.
Ves couldn’t blame them. He felt the same.
None of the designers shared where the Mech Corps sent them off to. Even though their comms projected the documents before their eyes, it could only be read by them and no one else. The contents also carried a confidential label, which they learned should not be spread without an express order from their superiors.
Ves didn’t know where Morgan and Bart would be sent to next, but his current assignment came as something of a surprise.
He’d been assigned to the design team of the 6th Flagrant Vandals Regiment. This wasn’t an unknown regiment. In fact, it enjoyed a lot of fame or notoriety depending on who you asked. It was the last regiment of the 3rd Tarry Division, which mainly garrisoned a lightly populated region in the extreme ’bottom’ end of the border between the two states.
Ves blinked in surprise at the assignment because the 6th Flagrant Vandals Regiment was a tried-and-true spaceborn regiment. To someone who dealt exclusively with landbound mechs, he was like a fish out of water if his assignment forced him to work with spaceborn mechs.
"What is the Mech Corps thinking?"
He quickly thought about the Flagrant Vandals. Though the public didn’t hear too much about this regiment, Ves heard more than enough stories from the Larkinsons who served in the previous wars.
The Vandals didn’t call themselves this way for nothing. They served as a dumping heap for problematic mech pilots. Any Larkinson who had the pleasure of fighting alongside the Vandals all mentioned how much they hated the ill-disciplined brutes.
"They’re a bunch of thugs. I’m ashamed they are a part of the Mech Corps! They should have been cashiered en masse!"
"Don’t think for a minute that you’re safe with a Vandal. They’ll cheat, scam or coerce all your wages from your bank account. Watch yourself well, and don’t ever end up alone in a room with a Vandal."
"Scoundrels, they are all scoundrels! Ever since Colonel Lowenfield took over the reigns, it’s gone downhill over there!"
Ves never heard anything good about the Flagrant Vandals. To him, who hoped to be assigned to a more renowned frontline regiment such as the Infernal Hellhounds or the Fire Fists, the news came as a huge disappointment to him. His performance should have entitled him to better treatment.
"Is it because of my complicated situation?"
Perhaps the Mech Corps didn’t trust or expected much from him. To a basket case like Ves, it was much more convenient to dump him to a design team attached to one of the most expendable regiments in the Mech Corps.
As Ves went through the motions and let a bunch of bots guide him and the others towards a swarm of waiting shuttles, he started to recall more stories about the Vandals.
Though they apparently carried a bad reputation, they also possessed a lot of ferocity. Nobody accused them of cowardice. This was because the Vandals was one of the few regiments that took up the responsibility of raiding Vesian space.
Whereas almost every mech of the Mech Corps operated within Republic space, the Vandals eagerly snuck past the stretched southern border between the two states and revelled in causing havoc in star systems the Vesians thought would never suffer an incursion.
The more Ves thought about it, the more he realized that it might not be a misdemeanor for him to join their design team.
"It’s not like I’ll be stationed aboard their combat carriers as they pass through the border."
Ves felt better about that. The only thing he needed to figure out was how he could adjust his skillset to accommodate the peculiarities of spaceborn mechs.
It wasn’t that simple for him to design a spaceborn mech without any prior experience.
As the shuttle lifted off from Bentheim, Ves looked around the cabin and figured that they wouldn’t be sent to the Vandals. They probably had their own assignments.
Of all the faces seated in the chairs, Ves only recognized Morgan. The man happened to turn around and their eyes suddenly met.
"Nervous?" Morgan asked out of the blue.
"No. I’m excited."
A few seconds passed before Morgan spoke again. "Look Ves, I did some thinking in the last month, and I realized I went too far that day when Jim let his frustrations take him over. Thinking back on that time, it’s pretty stupid of me to accuse you of being someone’s tool. Can you forgive me?"
Ves did not know what to say to the other mech designer. While he felt indignant about it at the time, he long pushed the matter to the back of his mind.
"I won’t forgive you, but I’m willing to let matters go." He eventually replied. "Don’t be so quick to believe in conspiracies next time."
"Thanks." Morgan nodded and turned back around.
Naturally, Ves didn’t believe that Morgan would change his ways. That man still believed that he needed to design every possible mech type in existence before he advanced.
While Ves didn’t ascribe to that theory, he found the logic behind it to be too compelling to dismiss it entirely. Perhaps Morgan spoke some truths about the consequences of rushing through the Apprentice stage.
At this moment, he was still undecided about the matter. He didn’t know if he should delay his advancement and absorb more experiences or continue his fast-faced growth and break through to Journeyman as fast as possible.
It was a good thing that Ves had plenty of time to choose. "I’ll get back to this when I reach the point where I can advance."
Ves leaned back in his chair as the shuttle broke through orbit and zipped towards a floating military station. A whole mass off military transport ships moored alongside the station. One of them would probably bring Ves to the Tarry System or somewhere close.
After a number of transfers, Ves entered an old-model transport ship. While large number of bots filled up the ship’s cargo hold with containers of supplies, Ves and two other mech designers entered a nearly-empty passenger compartment.
The compartment offered enough space for thirty passengers, though space was at a premium and the amenities left much to be desired. The yellowing white-paneled corridors and the faded and worn furniture made it clear that the vessel wasn’t well-maintained.
"This is where you mech designers will stay for the time being." A crewman assigned to guide them said as he chewed some sort of stimulant that would have seen him cashiered aboard a properly-run ship. "Once you enter, the main hatch here will lock so you won’t wander off and disturb the rest of the crew."
"We have to stay here for the entire duration of the trip!?" The only female mech designer among them spoke out. "There’s barely anything inside!"
"You can always stay within your bunks and go back to sleep. There’s a cabinet of nutrient packs along with a food recombinator, so you won’t starve. If you want some distraction, we left you some data chips that contains some of the games we play in our off time."
Ordinarily, Ves could at least browse the galactic net if he wanted a distraction. However, ever since he received his military-issued comm, he started to get around the fact that the Mech Corps would never let someone like him with a sliver of access to the rest of the galaxy. The local networks plainly refused to let his comm access the galactic net.
The spacer quickly went through some obligatory safety instructions before letting the mech designers stew inside their empty but cramped abodes.
A couple of seconds passed by as the three looked at each other awkwardly.
"Let’s claim our bunks before the others arrive."
"Good idea." The young woman nodded.
They each split up and entered some of the available cabins to claim their preferred sleeping spots. Ves stayed within the cabin and started to rearrange his thoughts. Ever since he learned he would be joining the design team of the 6th Flagrant Vandals, he dredged up every piece of knowledge that pertained to spaceborn mechs.
While spaceborn mechs didn’t look very different from aerial mechs, they actually operated under very different circumstances. An aerial mech could operate in space in a pinch, but would only be able to express eighty-or-so percent of their strength.
Spaceborn mechs on he other fared much worse in atmospheric conditions. Some didn’t even carry a strong-enough flight system to let their mechs remain aloft under standard gravity conditions.
Compared to landbound mechs, spaceborn mechs predominantly carried a notch less mass around. This was because it took a lot of energy to move these mechs around in space. The heavier the mech, the more energy it took to get it to move and make it come to a halt once it reached its destination.
Therefore, spaceborn mechs consisted of a much higher proportion of light mechs, though plenty of medium mechs existed as well. Besides the space knight mechs, every other medium spaceborn mech tended to mass at the lighter end of the medium weight class.
The decreased mass allowed these mechs to accelerate and decelerate rather quickly with more efficient but less powerful flight systems. It wasn’t unheard of for spaceborn mechs to be able to last an entire standard day in space.
"They’re smaller and lighter, but they’re also more fragile."
The emphasis on speed and agility and the vast room for maneuvering in space shifted the design of spaceborn mechs away from a reliance on armor. While the existence of Space Knights and the like still proved that armor played a role, in space, speed, or rather acceleration was king.
The higher a mech’s ability to accelerate, the better it would be able to dodge incoming attacks. Fast, unpredictable dodging patterns threw off the aim of enemy pilots.
For this reason, ballistic weapons was a tad bit less popular in space, though they still played a huge role when it came to attacking ships. It took far too long for lasers to carve through the hull of an enemy combat carrier.
Melee mechs played a role as well. Light skirmishers generally boasted excellent thrust-to-weight ratios, allowing them to close the distance to elusive ranged mechs and carve them up from up close.
"Still, the lack of any cover in space makes ranged mechs the dominant types of mechs in space."
Many battles took place in orbit or in the middle of an empty patch of space. Only rarely did battles erupt in asteroid fields or any other area where lots of objects floated nearby.
The lack of any cover for mechs to hide behind heavily favored ranged mechs. Even though their targets were easily capable of dodging most enemy fire, as long as a squad of mechs coordinated their fire, they could trap their target in a cage where they would get hit no matter where they dodged.
"In short, it’s a numbers game as well."
Spaceborn mechs therefore tended to be rather cheap and disposable. Their lighter construction meant they got damaged more easily and needed more frequent repairs or replacements. Fortunately, they rolled off the production lines in great numbers.
Only their mech pilots couldn’t be replaced. Although spaceborn mechs skimped out on a lot of areas compared to landbound mechs, the one component they left intact would always be the cockpit.
"This way of combat still sounds really wasteful."
The nature of space combat meant that skirmishes started and ended quickly. Whoever won the fight received the opportunity to salvage the wrecks and recoup the costs.
When Ves finished sorting out his knowledge base, he realized he still possessed a couple of holes in what he acquired up to this point.
"For spaceborn mechs, it’s important to know how flight systems works and how to compartmentalize the interior of a frame to the point where every separate compartment was airtight.
The most complicated variable related to space combat was definitely heat management. Without ground and air to transfer much of the heat generated by mechs, mechs mostly radiated out their heat like the ancient practice of toasting a bun.
This was far too slow compared to the amount of heat a mech built up during battle, so mech designers did everything possible to extend the time a spaceborn mech could fight without becoming too hot.
The Bright Republic didn’t have access to a lot of means to improve the heat management of their mechs. Therefore, the Republic’s spaceborn mechs tended to be built according to endurance and efficiency rather than peak performance.
That was one area where Ves happened to know a lot.
Ves reluctantly concluded that he should be able to understand most spaceborn mech designs. He could even design a mech on his own, though it would be a lot more inefficient compared to what was available in the market.
Someone knocked at the door of his cabin. It was one of the guys who initially boarded the ship. "Mr. Larkinson? Can you come to the common room? We should talk."
"Coming."
Ves jumped to his feet and smoothed down his standard-issue clothes. The Mech Corps stocked the dressers in the cabin with a simple green uniform that carried a patch of a half-designed mech. This was how a working uniform looked like for mech designers called up during the war.
The mech designers that formed the true core of the design teams wore the same uniform, but boasted a couple chevrons that denoted their higher stations.
As Ves exited his cabin and approached the common room, he took a seat at an oil-stained table. He looked around, and besides the young man and woman who arrived aboard the transport ship together with Ves, no one else was there.
"Is this it?" Ves frowned.
"I believe so."
Bentheim held an enormous amount of mech designers. Ves only saw a couple of hundred mech designers in the processing center where he went through training, but the Mech Corps erected a lot of other processing centers elsewhere. All those mech designers should have finished their training by now and boarded their ships today.
"Maybe we finished sooner than others."
"I just checked the panel near the hatch." The other man said. "It projects the estimated departure time of this ship. She’s disembarking from the military station in less than fifteen minutes. It’s safe to say that other passengers won’t be joining us."
This really startled Ves a bit. "Truly? I thought that design teams needed at least fifty mech designers or more."
During his training, Ves learned that design teams typically employed around full-time mech designers. During wartime, these design teams needed to accelerate the development of new designs, so the Mech Corps supplied them with a lot more mech designers.
The reinforcements consisted of one or more Journeyman Mech Designers accompanied by at least fifty Apprentice Mech Designers.
Hearing that this transport ship would depart with only 3 Apprentice Mech Designers was a whole other thing. Neither of the two other mech designers had a clue why their ship was empty of passengers.
"Maybe the Tarry System already received a batch of mech designers, or maybe they are aboard a different ship."
"Don’t kid yourself." Ves interjected. "This is the only transport ship that’s headed to the Tarry System. It’s not because their needs are already met, but because one ship is sufficient to supply the Vandals."
"What?!"
"Do you know what the 6th Flagrant Vandals looks like?"
Both the male and female mech designers shrugged or shook their heads.
"They’re a bunch of rogues." Ves began, and proceeded to bring his fellow mech designers up to speed with their reputation.
"They sound like pirates!"
Ves found that description to be particularly apt. It actually led him to believe that the Flagrant Vandals used to be a pirate gang that went legitimate.
The table fell into silence once again. Both the other two mech designers shuffled around their chairs with discomfort. They took part in the same training regime as Ves, so they still looked at him with apprehension.
"I’m not going to bite you all." He sighed. "I’m a Larkinson. You ever heard of them? I’m no different. I just chose to be a mech designer instead of a mech pilot."
That helped calm them down a little. The Larkinsons were known entities to the two designers, so associating them with Ves turned him into a somewhat more relatable person.
"Let’s start with the introductions. You already know who I am, so let’s move on to you two. Who are you?"
The woman started first. "My name is Laida Nnvist. I’m an Apprentice Mech Designer."
"Where are you from?"
"...Haston."
That caused Ves to take another look at Laida. The woman looked young and rather timid, completely unlike the stereotypical assertive hags that often came from this low-class city on Bentheim.
"That’s... interesting." Ves quickly turned to the other guy in the room. "And you?"
"Pierce Yuvalis." The man spoke in a low tone, as if he was affected by the presence of Ves as well. "I came from the Friday Coalition."
If Laida’s peculiar background raised some eyebrows, then Pierce’s origins absolutely floored Ves.
"Which partner do you hail from?"
"The Gauge Dynasty."
Both Laida and Ves stared at Pierce as if he was an alien. How in the hell did a mech designer who hailed from the most powerful partner of the Coalition ended up in the clutches of the Mech Corps?
"Tell us more."
Pierce provided some context. "My father is a mech designer from the Republic who emigrated to the Gauge Dynasty and married a local there."
Though Pierce was a little reticent, Ves applied a little pressure in order to get him to open up. It turned out that Pierce was the oldest among three children. He was also the least talented of the three.
Whereas his younger siblings excelled early in their studies, Pierce turned out to be a tad bit slower in being able to understand the fundamental sciences that every mech designer needed to learn.
His father, angry and disappointed at Pierce’s performance, pretty much banished the lad to the Republic.
Ves didn’t know what to say about that. It must have been a crushing letdown to be sent away by your own father. Moving from the most prosperous part of the Friday Coalition to the backwards Bright Republic would have pushed most mech designers into ending their own lives.
Hearing their stories and matching them with his own made him realize that they were outcasts.
The transport ship sluggishly separated from the military station and fell into formation alongside a convoy of vessels heading in the same direction. Most of the other transports would drop out along the way as they reached their destination star system. Only one ship was scheduled to reach the Tarry System, an important but fairly isolated defensive border system.
In the standard territorial depiction of the Komodo Star Sector, the Bright Republic and the Vesia Kingdom were situated at the northwest portion the map. Any ship that travelled further northwards reached the borders to the vast frontier.
The Tarry System was located at the southern portion of the border between the two warring states. It anchored a vast stretch of low-value star systems with scarce resources and even scarcer population. The Tarry region therefore held limited value even for the Vesia Kingdom, because they would need to allocate far more mechs to garrison the region than what was economical.
This didn’t mean that the Vesians ignored the border region entirely. Sometimes, desperate nobles shied away from the heavy fighting at the center of the border. On paper, the Tarry region only held a couple of mech divisions, so it should have been an easy target.
The truth turned out to be different. Located far away from Bentheim or Rittersberg, the Tarry divisions sat at the far end of the supply lines. Nevertheless, they learned how to make the most out of limited resources. The sheer amount of distance from the political and economic centers of the Republic granted the Tarry divisions a lot more leeway on how to operate their mechs, and they did well in adapting to the circumstances.
"From what I heard about the Tarry divisions, they form their own faction within the Mech Corps." Ves explained in front of Laida and Pierce. The strength he displayed during the training sessions elevated him to the forefront of their little group. "They’re often the last divisions in line to receive new upgrades or additional resources. I think this is the case for us as well. There’s no getting around the fact that we are the least desirable mech designers of our batch."
Somewhat surprisingly to Ves, the other two designers accepted his assertion without any challenge. Both Pierce and Laida encountered many disappointments in their lives.
"Let’s make the best of things. At least we aren’t being accompanied by some Journeyman Mech Designer that wants to boss us around. We can relax throughout the journey."
Ves studied the appearances of his newly assigned colleagues. Pierce looked similar to what Ves looked like before his various enhancements. Though he appeared rather skinny, his eyes reflected a very keen and measured mind. He possessed a black mop of hair not too different from Ves, though he let the grooming bots style his hair in a very neat and slick fashion.
As for Laida, Ves felt as if he faced a timid cat. The young woman’s body language displayed her lack of confidence that shouldn’t be present in Apprentice Mech Designers. She possessed dull light brown hair which was styled in a plain and boring bun. Her standard green uniform added a bit more sharpness to her body, and if not for her slouch, she would have looked moderately attractive.
Ves met a handful of female mech designers in his life. Those who achieved some success always held their heads up high and asserted themselves in some way.
For example, despite being just a Novice back then during the Leemar Open Competition, Miss Barakovski acted like she was a queen among peasants.
Patricia on the other hand acted in a more enigmatic fashion. Both at Rittersberg and at Leemar, she acted as if she was no one special, but her stellar performance made it impossible for anyone to dismiss her presence.
Therefore, Ves really didn’t understand why Laida put herself down like that.
Through some prodding, they got to know each other a little better. Ves expected that they would be working together from now on, so it was important for him to establish a good rapport with designers of the same level.
Ves shared some of history to the two designers. What they found most impressive with Ves was his willingness to partake in dangerous expeditions.
"I don’t have the guts to do the same." Pierce admitted with a rueful expression. "Mech designers aren’t meant to be out in the field."
Ves understood the sentiment. "That’s true in the strictest sense, but sometimes you won’t be able to achieve your dreams without putting in some extra effort. With so many mech designers out there doing the same things over and over, it takes a lot of inspiration and a unique perspective to stand out from the crowd. The rewards are also good as well."
"It’s too dangerous. Sorry, but I don’t agree with you. Better designs come from hard work. As long as you study hard and apply your knowledge well, you should be able to achieve more solid results."
That only worked up to a point, Ves thought, but he didn’t argue the point. Instead, he asked the other man a question. "You’re an Apprentice as well, right? What kind of work did you do since you graduated?"
"I worked at at a major mech manufacturer and joined their design teams. It wasn’t as large as the ones where we are heading into. The lead designer did most of the work and assistants like me only played a role in the debugging process."
"How good is the lead designer?"
"Oh he’s really good. He’s old but he’s a very seasoned Journeyman Mech Designer. He often stopped by to teach some points to us. I really benefited from his tutelage."
Unmentioned by Pierce was that the Journeyman Mech Designer likely held an ulterior motive for doing so. The way Pierce spoke about the leader designer didn’t carry a lot of endearment.
Likely, the Journeyman wanted to catch the attention of Pierce’s father.
There was nothing wrong with that in his eyes. Both Pierce and the lead designer benefited from such an arrangement. The only problem was that it didn’t look as if the lead designer succeeded in his goal.
"What kind of mechs have you worked with?"
"I have an extensive amount of experience in working with several different types of landbound mechs. I’ve taken part in the design process of at least eight different types of mechs."
That sounded very impressive, though it was easier to do when you spread the workload over multiple designers.
"Sounds like you have a lot of experience working in a team." Ves nodded. "I only worked on my designs on my own. I’ve never really collaborated with others when it came to developing an original design."
While Ves admired Pierce’s experience in working on many collaborative projects, the other two mech designers expressed their own admiration to him for relying on himself to develop a functional design.
Pierce let out a weary sigh.""Even with my experiences, I only ever attempted to publish a single original mech. I couldn’t get the lead designer to release the funds for me to fabricate a prototype. It wasn’t a commercially attract product, he said."
It wasn’t easy to make the jump from taking part in a collaborate project to designing mechs on your own. Ves only managed to do so by acquiring years worth of knowledge with the help of the System.
"If you want to design your original mech, there’s no substitute for learning the theories on your own. Teaching can only go so far."
"I know. I have access to plenty of reading materials, but the things I need to learn are too much or too hard."
"Even so, at least you have access to them. THat’s a lot better than what most mech designers enjoy."
After learning just enough about Pierce, Ves turned to Laida, who had been listening quietly all this while.
"What about you? What’s your story?"
"I graduated from the AUMD."
It turned out she excelled in school in Haston and succeeded in applying to Ansel on a scholarship. This was extremely impressive for someone who grew up in Haston.
Still, Laida didn’t talk too much about her experiences in the AUMD. She skimmed over her years in school and skimmed through her graduation.
"After that, I found a job at a design studio. I chose to specialise in designing aerial mechs, so I became involved in all of the designs that could fly."
"How many designs have you contributed to?"
"Over twenty different designs."
"That’s a lot."
"It’s not that impressive. Design studios work differently than mech manufacturers. We developed as much designs as possible, and many of them consisted of variants that shared a lot of things in common. Only one out of ten of our designs are licensed. The rest end up collecting dust in an archive."
Even so, Laida must have gained a lot of experience in working with different mechs. This was the norm for mech designers that worked in a team.
Though Ves still thought he had the edge in terms of independent design, he probably would fare a little worse if he ended up in a situation where he had to work together with others.
"I have one question for you, Ves." Laida blinked at him. "Why did you choose to stay in the Republic? With your opportunities, you could have made a name for yourself in the Coalition."
Ves and Pierce both shrugged their heads.
"The Coalition isn’t so easy to establish a foothold on. There’s more money to be made there, but there’s a lot more competition there as well. The best and brightest of the Komodo Star Sector all flock to Coalition space in order to take advantage of the higher spending power and more abundant resources. What they don’t realize is that as outsiders, they are already on the back foot compared to the locals."
"Oh."
"I’m doing fairly well on my own here in the Republic. My company has grown fast and I’ve already published two original designs. I would have never been able to achieve this much if I tried to do business in the Coalition."
The Bright Republic was also his home and the root of the Larkinsons. Ves felt at home here in a way the Coalition could never provide. Their cultures different too much for Ves to ever grow comfortable in that prosperous second-rate state.
Pierce knew a lot about this as well. "There are too many foreigners in Coalition space. The Carnegie Group is the most attractive destination for them as their institutions accept the most outsiders. What these foreign mech designers don’t realize is that the Carnegie Group only picks out the best. The vast majority of foreigners aren’t able to accomplish anything except to become saddled with mountains of debt."
"What happens to those with debt?"
"They hire themselves off as slaves, basically." Pierce answered grimly. "The Coalition doesn’t call them that, though. They instead employ extremely restrictive hiring contracts that run for a period of fifty or even a hundred years, depending on which coalition partner you are dealing with. A mech manufacturer from the Konsu Clan can even get away with a contract that lasts for your entire lifetime."
"Who would ever accept that kind of contract?!"
"A lot more mech designers than you think. You have to realize that it’s extremely expensive for someone from a third-rate state to live in a second-rate state. The price of everything you buy is a hundred times more expensive. That goes for rent and tuition as well."
In short, staying a single year in Coalition space cost as much as living a hundred years in an average third-rate state like the Bright Republic.
"Why don’t they declare themselves bankrupt and start anew?"
Pierce shook his head. "The laws of the Friday Coalition only extends that right to its own citizens. Foreigners like you and Ves won’t get away that easily. They’ll put a metaphorical gun against your head and force you to sign a contract of indentured servitude. Don’t think that you will end up designing mechs after signing such a contract. You’ll mostly be used as human calculators that need to do jobs that require human judgement."
"Therefore, the Friday Coalition isn’t that good of place to go unless you are supremely confident in your talent." Ves added after that. "And in most cases, they won’t even consider employing a mech designer who graduated from an institution from a third-rate state. We’re too low-class for them to take us seriously."
Laida looked crestfallen at the news. Ves figured that she might have held some hopes for starting elsewhere, but the truth was often brutal.
It took three weeks for the convoy to meander through Republic space, dropping a couple of ships off at every star system along the way, before it reached the Tarry System. By then, the convoy only consisted of a handful of ships.
The three mech designers noticed none of that. The crew kept them in their assigned compartment and never issues any notifications except to warn them of FTL transitions.
As a group of outcasts, none of them shared much in common, nor did they speak too much about their background beyond the basics.
The restrictive passenger compartment contained nothing but furniture and food. The few projectors they found couldn’t be turned on to display a news feed or outdated dramas.
Thus, with nothing else to do, they shifted to talking about the only thing they had in common.
"What are the nuances of designing aerial mechs? What do you have to take into account?" Ves asked as he sat across the table from Laida.
"Aerial mechs are designed specifically according to a range of gravities. Most designs work best at 1.0 g, the standard gravity of Old Earth, because most states prioritize on terraforming planets that closely match this gravity."
"Not all planets feature standard gravity. A significant amount of planets have gravities that range from 0.5 g to 2 g."
Though the woman was rather shy when it came to her personal life, she carried herself with a bit more confidence when it came to her expertise.
"That’s why a mech that’s designed to operate at 1.0 g will always lose against a mech designed to operate at 0.6 g on a 0.6 g planet."
"Why is that so?" Ves furrowed his brows. "A mech that’s rated to fly at 1.0 g carries a much stronger flight system. I can understand why it won’t be able to perform as effective in a 2.0 g environment where gravity is twice as strong, but if the gravity is forty percent weaker, shouldn’t it be forty percent stronger?"
"You landbound mech designers are all the same." Laida rubbed her head. "You have to realize that aerial light mechs devote up to half of their volume and carrying capacity to their flight systems alone. I can’t say too much about medium mechs, but for light mechs, every cubicle centimeter is as precious as exotics. Space that could have been used to strengthen the mech’s armor or firepower instead has to be dedicated to powering the flight system or shunt away its heat."
"Ah. So it’s a matter of priorities. So if I understand you correctly, an aerial mech that’s designed to fly in 0.6 g will allocate less capacity to supporting the flight system?"
"Correct." Laida bobbed her thin head, causing her bun of hair to bob in a cute fashion. "You can say that such a mech is becoming less of an aerial mech and more of a landbound mech. In extreme cases, such as small moons or large asteroids, an aerial mech could theoretically make due with a handful of anti-grav modules for three-dimensional propulsion, though the lack of atmosphere in those environments is better suited to spaceborn mechs."
"What’s the difference between spaceborn mechs and aerial mechs?"
"Early on, there wasn’t any difference. Mechs with flight systems did double duty because it was more affordable to design and produce a single model that could do both than dedicate two separate models entirely. It’s only later that the two classifications came into being."
"Because of specialization?"
"Yes. A mech designed to operate in space doesn’t need to accommodate for gravity. Instead, they have to be designed to withstand a lot of g-forces and rapid changes in course. As for aerial mechs, they need to be able to retain their balance in the air at all times. Their flight systems are also tweaked to be highly efficient in counteracting the force of gravity that is being exerted from below."
Laida freely explained all of the nuances behind designing aerial mechs. Ves heard about some of these maxims, but never in such detail and accompanied by the personal insight of a mech designer who knew what she was talking about.
Of course, Laida didn’t explain her insights for free. Among mech designers, an exchange of this nature required Ves to put up knowledge of equal value.
As Laida finished providing Ves with a general overview of aerial mechs, she began to ask her own questions. "What do you need to pay attention to when you design an original mech on your own?"
"A lot of things. There’s too much to mention. Leaving aside the material requirements such as possessing the right licenses and having access to the production equipment, designing a mech is mainly a test of your vision."
"Vision?" Laida frowned as she pursed her lips. "What is vision?"
That caused Ves to stare at Laida as if she forgot to wear a helmet on a spacewalk. "You studied at the Ansel University of Mech Design, right? Don’t they teach you the importance of vision in their classes?"
Laida still looked clueless. "They primarily focused on teaching the sciences to us. The school calls it setting a firm foundation. Without knowing the math and science behind designing mechs, there’s no chance of becoming a qualified mech designer."
Through their talks, Ves found out that Laida was indeed fairly competent in that area. Her intelligence couldn’t be underestimated and it was impressive how well she grasped the mechanics of designing an aerial mech.
However, Ves found it really strange that her school neglected to teach the artistic side to mech design.
"Designing mechs is both an art and a science. Building up a foundation sounds good and all, but that doesn’t prepare you to design a mech on your own. Did they even teach you the steps you needed to follow to develop an original design?"
"...No. Many graduates of the AUMD are expected to learn these lessons after graduation. A lot of promising alumni take in the most promising graduates and teach them the ropes."
Despite her talent in learning, Laida fell outside their scope. Her hometown of Haston did not fit in the elite society of Ansel.
She was lucky that other employees still valued her AUMD degree. She reluctantly joined a design studio as a junior assistant and enjoyed a first-hand glimpse on how the designers of the studio created new aerial mech designs.
However, the design studio’s generosity had limits. the senior designers never seriously groomed her into becoming a senior designer in their studio.
Perhaps that was why Laida radiated a lack of confidence.
"Laida, designing an original mech is not that hard." Ves said softly. "It comes from the heart, not the mind. True, a mech is a technical product that can be broken down in a set of parameters, but if everything can be solved with numbers, why don’t we leave the job of designing mechs to AIs?"
Creating a complex war machine the size of a building opened up an endless amount of possibilities. Its design could take on countless of shapes. Some of them might be better than others, but none could claim to be perfect. Even the strongest processors in the galaxy would never be able to derive the perfect mech design.
Because it didn’t exist.
"Rittersburg might not be the most renowned institution in the Republic when it comes to mech design, but the method they taught me has served me well in my career."
Ves understood why the AUMD took a different approach. For Novices and Apprentices, it was indeed important to accumulate as much knowledge as possible. Someone who didn’t know the answer of one plus one could forget about designing a mech.
For the next half hour, Ves conveyed her with a brief introduction of the basic approach on how to design an original mech.
It started with setting a vision. Without a solid clue on what you wanted to design, your work wouldn’t be constrained by any rules. Mech designers who forgot about vision often strayed from their initial intentions and let their designs to be affected by feature creep and disharmony.
Only after a designer established a vision for their mech could they begin to follow the other steps. Ves briefly explained on what she needed to pay attention on when she moved to the draft stage.
"The specifics aren’t very important. A good draft design is flexible enough to accommodate a number of different component licenses. Don’t set anything in stone, or else you will limit yourself to components that turn out not to fit with your design."
After that came feedback, the initial design phase, the initial simulation phase, the prototype testing phase, and depending on the amount of time, manpower and resources available, the design process might loop back into a second round of designing and testing.
"That sounds exactly like how we work at the design studio." Laida nodded once she realized she came back to familiar territory. "Designing mechs is a very iterative process. Involving more designers allows for more directions to follow. Sometimes, the lead designer of a project changes after each new iteration. The studio takes the original design and publishes it while the design team that’s in charge of the project is already developing a new variant."
Ves nodded in understanding. Adopting such a development cycle enabled the design studio to come up with a large amount of variants, each of them carrying unique traits due to the change in lead designers.
"When you work on your own, you don’t have the luxury to iterate all that much. Up to now, I only went back to the design board after one or two rounds of testing. Due to practical constraints, I couldn’t spend more than a couple of months on each of my original designs."
"That’s still an impressive achievement!" Laida softly praised as her eyes grew a little more worshipful at him. "I could never finish an original design within a year."
"A year is too long. If it takes you that long to get a design together, then you aren’t ready to embark on this venture."
"How can I speed up my work, then?"
"Think long and hard about your plan. When I designed my mechs, I could have spent a lot more time on modelling the performance of my design. Yet I only spent a month or so on this at most. Do you know why? Because the tradeoff wasn’t worth it. I could have spent another month at crunching the numbers, but it would have only improved my work by one percent or less."
Granted, many people cared about about that one percent. The whole point of the Mech Corps drafting so many mech designers was to provide more manpower to operations that only achieved something substantial as long as it involved enough people.
It was a very brute force way of solving a problem, but as long as it worked, the Mech Corps did nothing wrong.
Laida needed some time to realize this point. "I learned never to let go of an opportunity to improve the design, no matter how slim the parameters grow. It’s hard for me to adjust my thinking into letting these opportunities go."
"Trust me, when you run your own business, you need to get used to balancing costs and priorities." Ves chuckled in amusement at her struggle. He felt as if he threw a cat in a bathtub full of water. "When designing your mechs, you should never lose track of your vision for your design. Parameters are important, but I’d rather let go of some percentage points of performance and adhere to my vision than the other way around."
Ves truly provided a different perspective to Laida. Though his approach to mech design didn’t sound very complicated, it different substantially from everything she learned from the design studio. None of the senior designers there talked about a vision. The only thing that resembled a vision was a list of demands that their designs should meet.
A different voice spoke out from the side. "You’re wrong, Mr. Larkinson."
They both turned around to see Pierce, who had just finished taking a shower.
"Why am I wrong?"
"Your method is too rigid. It’s all well and good to visualize your end goal at the start of your design process, but designing a mech is a very fluid process. The more you flesh out your design, the more you start to reconsider the choices made at the start. You always know more when you are in the middle of designing your mech than when you started on the draft."
"The iterative cycle is meant to accommodate a mech designer’s desire to change his choice."
"That’s different." Pierce retorted. "It’s like putting a box of rusting bolts from one side of a storage room to the other side of the storage room. The correct decision here would be to take the box away from the storage room entirely."
This was a very different mindset from what Ves had encountered before.
"Why do you say so?" Ves asked Pierce.
Though the other mech designer looked a little uncomfortable at voicing his thoughts, as a mech designer he had his own way of doing things. "Well, from what I’ve learned from my father’s admittedly brief tutelage, your method is best suited for beginners who aren’t always able to control their impulses. Sticking to a well-defined concept formed at the start is very helpful preventing the project from going out of control. Yet it’s not the way an ambitious mech can be designed."
Ves thought about it a bit. Pierce had a point. "If you are designing something experimental, then I can see why you would want to keep your options open, but it sounds too much as if you are starting your design with no idea what will happen as a result."
"The people I worked with think that designs that can be imagined from the start of a project aren’t good enough to be developed. A great design is a product that is only revealed at the end of a lengthy journey of exploration."
"Is that how it goes in the design team of a large mech manufacturer?"
Pierce nodded. "The mindset among the older, more experienced designers is that they need to be more unconstrained in their design process. The best designs they came up with are often the result of long periods of experimentation. The fewer the limitations, the higher the odds of creating something remarkable."
This was a completely different perspective from what Ves had learned. "How can mech designers keep control? It sounds really chaotic to me if nobody on the design team have a common vision on what their end product should look like."
"That’s exactly the merit of this approach. Because everyone has a different picture in mind for the design, everyone has the opportunity to test out their insights. This way, you get the most options possible and allows the lead designer to pick from a wide range of possibilities."
"So the key here is the lead designer."
"Yes. The lead designer is the only person on the team who needs to retain some semblance of control. In some design teams, he acts as a herder that guides the mech designers under him in the right direction. In other teams, the lead designer takes the role of the composers, and imposes a bit more order in the process. THe most important factor however is that the design team should be setup in a way that takes advantage of each member’s creativity."
Ves understood the point of such an organizational structure when Pierce mentioned creativity. It allowed every member to contribute, thereby effectively making the most out of the design team’s creativity.
In other words, it compensated for the lead designer’s lack of imagination.
"I can see the advantages in such an approach." Ves replied. "Yet it sounds awfully wasteful and inefficient. Many ideas will be tried without any chance of ever getting incorporated in the main design. An incoherent vision will also do the design no good when it ends up with a lack of harmony."
That last point was difficult to explain. Ves really wanted to say that his method of fostering the growth of the X-Factor in his designs wouldn’t work if he didn’t hold on to a strong and predetermined vision.
All three mech designers argued about the merits of both approaches. Ves was a strong proponent of previsualisation, while Pierce thought that such an approach was only suitable for inexperienced mech designers.
"What do you think, Laida?"
"It depends on your goal. Although it sounds simple and limiting, the approach from Ves sounds the best if you are designing an original mech on your own. As for exploring many different ideas at once, it’s only suitable if there are lots of mech designers working on the same project."
In the context of a design team, the two methods determined whether the lead designer wanted to take a top-down or bottom-up approach to mech design.
"The latter approach only makes sense if the design team consists of a gathering of equals." Ves stated. "In nearly every other case, the design team will be better served if the lead designer exerts control."
After a bit more back-and-forth, they couldn’t come to an agreement on this topic. To Ves who valued mechs for their intrinsic identities, he knew the importance of defining a mech’s existence from the start. However, he couldn’t convoy this argument because it touched upon his trade secrets.
Ves prized his secrets above everything else, so he willingly let the argument end with a tie. Laida still looked a little confused, but she appeared to be getting around the idea of developing a vision for her design.
Throughout the rest of the journey, they discussed other matters related to mech design, and each designer came away with learning something new.
From Laida, Ves learned what he needed to pay attention to when he designed an aerial mech. From Pierce, Ves became enlightened to the different methods used by mech designers in the Gauge Dynasty. From both, he also learned how to work in different design team environments.
This was essential knowledge to him because he desperately lacked experience in this area.
As Ves happily soaked up knowledge and gave out some of his own in return, the transport ship finally reached the end of the convoy route. The weathered transport transitioned out of FTL at the edge of the Tarry System.
For the first time in weeks, the outer hatch opened up. A crewman popped his head inside. "We’ve reached the Tarry System. A shuttle is on its way to take you to another ship."
Ves looked up at the news. "This isn’t our end destination?"
"Not from what I heard."
Perhaps the Vandals maintained their bases elsewhere. The mech designers shrugged at the news and waited to be picked up.
With their arrival to the Tarry System, some of the restrictions to their comms had been lifted for some reason. They gained access to a highly limited network that nevertheless proved to be a treasure trove of information.
"A number of battles have already occurred in the Tarry System."
The reports made available to them didn’t specify the number of mechs involved or how many of them got wrecked. They didn’t even mention the units involved either.
The only special thing about the reports was that they detailed the designs of the mechs involved and analyzed their strengths and weaknesses after the fact. This granted Ves and the others a pretty good picture of what kind of mechs saw use on this part of the frontlines.
Ves quickly came to a conclusion after skimming through the reports. "When it comes to both ground and space warfare, the mechs here are smaller and lighter. Pitched battles are rare, but skirmishes and raids are the order of the day."
The others agreed, though they stayed silent. Their reading and comprehension speeds couldn’t keep up with Ves.
"Have the Vesians ever committed to an invasion?"
"They overwhelmed some border systems at the outbreak of the war, but hadn’t moved forward since. They are still consolidating their gains and haven’t made a major move since."
The Vesians took the slow approach in the Tarry region. With much less mechs and resources allocated to this front, the Vesians moved at a snail’s pace. Yet despite their languid pace, they proved impossible for the Tarry divisions to dislodge.
As they read the reports, the transport ship quietly reached a midpoint in the System, whereupon the mech designers suddenly had to leave the passenger compartment. Without much ado, they entered an airlock which extended out an enclosed ramp onto the hatch of another ship.
Once they walked across and entered the airlock of the other ship, they entered a metallic grey corridor of a small and cramped corvette.
"Mr. Larkinson, Mr. Yuvalis and Miss Nnvist, right?" An easy-going spacer greeted them as they entered the ship. The man looked like he could use a good shave, and his red-colored uniform could use another wash. "Your cabins are already prepared. It’s a little tight here, so you’re going to have to bunk with the crew. Apologies for that."
Ves and the others looked at each other. Nobody had a clue what went on. "Lead the way."
The spacer guided them to their cabins as he casually chewed a stimulant, something which the Mech Corps strictly forbid. "You guys came at a swell time. Professor Velten has been ringing the Mech Corps for extra manpower for years now. It finally took the outbreak of the war for those stingy bastards to send some of you out to the Vandals."
"Who is Professor Velton?"
"That’s the boss man of the research base you’re about to go to. I can’t tell you where it’s located, it’s all hush hush and such. All I can say is that the Vesians will never be able to pin it down."
They reached the cabins where their bots dropped off some of their luggage. Ves continued to ask some questions from the crewman. "Is this ship part of the Vandals fleet?"
"She sure is! She’s called the Bloodless Dagger, born and bred as a Vesian but taken as a prize by us a couple of years ago. We sure taught those bastards a bloody lesson back then!"
The three mech designers looked shocked at the spacer. "The war didn’t even start until more than half a year ago!"
"Hah! It’s not like we need a declaration of war to stir up some trouble. We Vandals are all about taking opportunities. The Vesians have always been our enemy. Peace with the Vesians is a big fat lie. We’ve raided their systems and trade routes plenty of times and they have done the same to us. The only difference now is that we don’t have to go through the trouble of camouflaging ourselves as pirates."
The more the spacer blabbed on about the previous actions of the Vandals, the more they sounded like pirates!
"Why all the raids?" Ves couldn’t help but ask.
"Because we’re the 6th! Those fancy ponces over at Rittersberg and Bentheim never send out adequate supplies to us! Our division is at the end of a long supply chain, and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th regiments get their turn first before leaving the leftovers to us! Hah! By the time we receive our supplies, everything has been siphoned away."
This happened a lot in the Mech Corps, but Ves never realized that the 6th Flagrant Vandals had it so bad.
"So the Vandals have resorted to stealing from the Vesians to gather their supplies?"
"Yup."
"How do you get away with it?"
The spacer grinned. "It’s all thanks to Colonel Lowenfield. Ever since she took charge of the Vandals, we’re no longer begging the others for fuel, parts and other supplies."
This colonel must be a remarkable leader if she was able to control this bunch of ruffians.
The Bloodless Dagger didn’t stick around the Tarry System for long. She headed towards a nearby gas giant’s Lagrange point and smoothly transitioned into FTL.
As the three mech designers spent their time aboard the corvette, they quickly learned that the crew didn’t make any attempts at keeping them under control. Besides restricting their comms, they allowed Ves to go outside their cabins and explore the tiny ship, not that they saw all that much. It was still a corvette.
Though the crew acted a little casual around the mech designers, they still showed some discipline in their normal operations. They at least still showed signs of being a part of the Mech Corps in the things that mattered. The Bloodless Dagger was well-maintained for a captured ship and none of the spacers appeared incompetent. It showed that the corvette had definitely taken a lot of risks.
"You know, maybe it’s not so bad to be assigned to the Vandals."
The corvette entered a lifeless star system with no known settlements. Ves and the mech designers weren’t allowed to know where it was located, which underscored the importance of this seemingly empty system.
After another day of coasting towards the inner system, they stopped by a vast asteroid belt that ringed around the dull yellow sun. From there, Ves expected to enter some sort of secret asteroid base, but instead the corvette came face to face with one of the largest industrial ships he had ever seen.
"Is that a factory ship?"
"That, and more. You’re looking at the one and only Wolf Mother."
The so-called Wolf Mother was imposingly large. Larger than a fleet carrier, even, though both her hull and armor couldn’t compare to a ship dedicated for battle.
As a factory ship, the Wolf Mother was basically a manufacturing complex compressed in a single hull with some thrusters and and FTL engine slapped to her. The Wolf Mother’s design looked rather crude, displaying many gaps in the hull that led to empty cavities that hadn’t been filled since her commissioning.
"So this is where the Vandals design and produce their mechs?" Ves asked in a weird voice.
"That’s right."
"That’s not possible! A ship of this size can’t service an entire regiment’s worth of mechs!"
A normal regiment fielded around two-thousand mechs at a time, but that didn’t take into account the spare parts and spare mechs that would be necessary to keep the unit at full strength.
Despite its massive size, only a tiny portion of the factory ship could be dedicated to the production lines. Each production line expended an enormous amount of power and resources, so Ves estimated that the Wolf Den only held two production lines at most, and that would be straining the ship.
To that, the spacer sent a cheeky smile at Ves. "Who said we need to rely on our own mechs to fight?"
"Oh."
Ves forgot about the usual conduct of the Flagrant Vandals. They were so cut-off from conventional supply lines that they needed to steal or scavenge everything for themselves. This also applied to mechs.
The imposing manner of the Wolf Mother only grew as the tiny corvette approached one of her docking spaces. The factory ship looked so immense that her hangers even offered enough space to let in the Bloodless Dagger, not that they did so this time. The Bloodless Dagger didn’t require any servicing.
"How old is the Wolf Mother?" Pierce asked.
"She’s over thirty years old. She’s actually a product of the previous war."
Ves didn’t know whether he should feel afraid or reassured at that fact. The vessel definitely looked like she had been through a war. Much of her armor looked like a patchwork construction where different holes and battle scars had been covered up by any available armor plating the Vandals could get their hands on.
This led to a very shabby appearance. If not for her size and solidness, Ves would have mistaken the Wolf Mother for a floating junk heap.
The interior of the ship looked a little better compared to her exterior. Once the Bloodless Dagger docked with the factory ship and let out the mech designers, Ves felt as if he entered a cross between the Mech Nursery and a fleet carrier.
The Wolf Mother was completely geared towards logistics. Massive grinders and other processing equipment broke down asteroid chunks and extracted every useful materials from the remains. Elsewhere, mighty production lines churned out part after part for both mechs and ships.
The brief view he got as a guide led them across the corridors made it clear that the Wolf Mother had been built in a piecemeal fashion. She started small, but the Vandals tacked on more compartments over time, until she eventually reached her current size.
This haphazard method of expansion might have suited the Vandals well, but it left little room for protection. Even a much smaller combat carrier would be able to endure more damage than this tough-looking but fragile-shelled logistics ship.
After passing through a maze of corridors, they reached a large out-of-the-way compartment. "This is your stop. Professor Velten is expecting you."
They entered what appeared to be a design lab. Rows of terminals connected to powerful processors stood ready to perform any number of simulations. Further ahead, Ves spotted areas which facilitated the design process in many different ways.
For example, one open space contained a table that supported minifab. This tiny 3D printer only worked with a handful of materials, but through the application of different treatments, it was perfect for fabricating tiny models that could help with the visualization of the design.
The newcomers entered an office to the side. Professor Velten looked up from the data pad he studied and smiled. "Come on!"
The Professor was a short and aging woman. She obviously enjoyed a coupe of age-prolonging treatments, but they didn’t seem to be of very great quality. Nevertheless, her status alone forced the three arrivals to show a measure of respect before taking their seats, because the professor turned out to be a Senior Mech Designer.
"Ah, it delights me to see new chickens have come." The professor smiled in a slightly creepy manner. "You are the fourth, fifth, and sixth mech designers to have arrived from the inner regions of the Republic."
The old woman spoke no further but eyed them as if they were exotics.
"Ahem, Professor," Ves began. "What are our responsibilities?"
That forced the absent-minded professor back into the present. "There is much that needs to be done! You may have realized that we are very short-handed. Even if we cut back our projects, we are barely able to keep up! There are a total of three Journeyman Mech Designers under my wing, and each of them lead a small design team of around three Apprentices."
That didn’t sound like an impressive team at all.
"Due to... the difficulties in securing a sufficient amount of time, money, resources and manpower, I have restricted the development of new and improved designs to three different mech lines."
A typical design team with over a hundred mech designers working together could easily support the development of a dozen designs at the same time. Professor Velten’s team barely managed to scrape by with only three designs.
Like a lonesome granny who only saw her grandparents once a year, Professor Velten treated Ves, Pierce and Laida like they were precious treasures.
"Three Apprentices have already arrived from the Rittersberg region. Along with your arrival, that makes six fresh faces. Sadly, that’s the extent of their generosity. They haven’t even sent us some much-needed Journeymen!"
After ranting a bit about the lack of concern from headquarters, Professor Velten returned to the topic at hand.
"It’s best if the three of you split up and each take part of one of the three projects in development. It is not as if the addition of three extra Apprentices to a single project will make any difference compared to sending only one. It takes at least ten more mech designers for the synergy to become apparent."
The professor didn’t let them choose their assignment. She briefly read their profiles and track records and arbitrarily added them to the teams that best matched their skills.
"Miss Nnvist, you will be joining the design team that is working on the Inheritor spaceborn skirmisher design."
"Mr. Yuvalis, you shall be joining the design team that’s responsible for improving the Akkara heavy mech design."
"As for you, Mr. Larkinson, you will fit wonderfully with the design team that is developing the successor to the Hellcat spaceborn hybrid knight design."
What? A spaceborn hybrid knight design?
Before Ves could puzzle over the extensive challenges behind designing a hybrid knight with enough capacity to support a flight system, Professor Velten pushed them out and ordered them to meet with their respective design teams. The professor unceremoniously shooed them away from her office.
Once the hatch locked, they all looked at each other.
"The professor is a little senile, is she not?" Ves remarked.
Neither Laida nor Pierce dared to comment on Professor Velten’s mental state. She was a Senior Mech Designer after all. Even if they left her presence, she could still be listening in through the countless bugs embedded in this compartment.
Ves sighed. As someone who met a Master Mech Designer in the flesh, the prestige of a Senior Mech Designer hardly fazed him. He even found the professor to be a rather pitiful person. Perhaps her erratic mind was the reason why she lead the design team of the Vandals.
After consulting their comms, they split up and entered different compartments. Ves entered a sub-lab area where three other Apprentices sat behind a row of terminals performing various simulations and microadjustment of the latest iteration of the Hellcat design.
The other Apprentices stopped their work once Ves entered the compartment. A thin man with a towering height in his late thirties looked up from the schematics of a power reactor and turned his attention to Ves.
"Have you come from Professor Velten?"
"Yes, sir. These are my orders."
Ves passed over a data chip to the Journeyman, who slipped it into his terminal and read the contents.
One tidbit caused the man to stop his perpetual glower for a moment. "You’re a Larkinson? Are you related to..."
This was a familiar refrain to Ves. "Yes, I’m part of the Larkinson Family."
A few seconds passed.
"Very well then." The Journeyman nodded and resumed reading his records. "It says here that you have experience in designing hybrid knights."
"Not exactly, sir. I haven’t designed a hybrid knight from scratch. I developed a variant of an existing model."
"Which base model?"
"The Caesar Augustus."
That caused the tall man to scowl. "That piece of crap?! Why did you waste your time on that bloated mess?"
"I didn’t have any choice. I received its production license from a generous grant."
After making it clear that Ves didn’t deliberately choose to work with the Caesar Augustus, the Journeyman calmed down. "Very well then. Despite your limit track record, at least you know your way around with hybrid knights. Do mind you, a spaceborn hybrid knight is a radically different creature from a landbound hybrid knight, so don’t think you have the edge over your fellow Apprentices."
The Journeyman bobbed his head towards the three young Apprentices who sat attentively as they studied Ves.
"My name is Alloc Brandstad, and I’m the only Journeyman Mech Designer that lasted more than five years under Professor Velten’s supervision."
Alloc spoke those words with an exhausted tone.He shook his head and returned Ves his data chip. "Keep that chip safe. Otherwise you’ll get in trouble with the Wolf Mother’s security contingent."
"Understood, sir."
"Let me apprise you of the role of the Hellcat within the Vandals."
The 6th Flagrant Vandals used to be supported by a team of over fifty mech designers. That was only half as much as any other regiment, but it was more than sufficient to the undersupplied Vandals.
For some reason or another, the design team diminished to its current state. Professor Velten need to make a brutal choice and cut back the active number of designs in development. She chose to retain the most essential designs that formed the core of the Vandals.
The professor’s choice of retaining the Hellcat in active development turned out to be very controversial.
"Hybrid knights are difficult to design at the best of times. Spaceborn hybrid knights are almost impossible to design even if you put over a hundred mech designers to the task. Nevertheless, both Professor Velten and Colonel Lowenfield put down their feet. The Hellcat is an essential mech that enjoys a place of honor among the Vandals."
Much like the Caesar Augustus, the Hellcat was a versatile mech meant to be piloted by leaders. The Vandals fielded less than twenty-five Hellcats at a time, mainly because they couldn’t scrounge up enough mech pilots that could make good use of a hybrid knight.
"Make no mistake." Alloc said with emphasis. "Despite the small number of Hellcats in existence, they have served as the linchpins of the Vandals in every single battle in space since their inception. The hellcat is more than a single design. It is a symbol."
Developing and improving the Hellcat design required an enormous amount of effort. Yet the Hellcat design team only consisted of four permanent mech designers with two temporary additions, of which Ves was one of them. Professor Velten supervised the entire effort and occasionally stepped in to solve some difficult issues, but she was too busy to spend all of her time on a single design.
"Professor Velten isn’t as spry as she used to." Alloc said in an emotional fashion. "A couple of decades ago, she could easy keep track of dozens of concurrent designs, but now... she’s barely holding it with three concurrent designs."
Any mech designer who advanced to the rank of Senior was a formidable person. No one ever reached this height by being stupid. Professor Velten must have been an intellectual force at her prime.
Ves barely knew anything about the 6th Flagrant Vandals or Professor Velten. Both diverged so much from how the Mech Corps usually organized their units that Ves wondered what lay at the heart of their difficulties.
"Sir, I’ve just arrived and I’m not very familiar with the Tarry region or the Vandals. Can you give me a rundown on the mech regiment?"
Alloc sighed and released a weary breath. "The Flagrant Vandals look kind of bad, don’t they?"
Ves nodded.
"That’s because the Vandals never quite fit into the Mech Corps."
Alloc briefly explained the origins of the Vandals. It used to be setup by an ambitious general over sixty years ago. The general tired of the constant defensive attitude of the Tarry region divisions, so erected an additional mech regiment with the express purpose of giving the Vesians a bloody nose.
"The only problem with the Vandals is that the Tarry region is poorly endowed. It can barely field whatever forces they already possessed. Burdening the regional headquarters with a full regiment of mechs and everything that came with it pretty much broke the budget."
Other problems also became apparent. Entering Vesian space was a perilous ordeal and while the Vandals achieved some early successes, they occasionally ran into a prepared opponent that decimated their raiding forces. The regiment used up a lot more mechs, mech pilots, ships and supplies than originally projected.
"So what changed from the start?" Ves asked.
Alloc shrugged his head. "Headquarters came up with a new order for the Vandals that’s never been recalled. The 6th Flagrant Vandals needs to be completely self-sufficient. They have to fabricate or procure their own mechs and ships and they need to recruit and train their own mech pilots."
This completely cut off all of the support that was necessary to sustain a mech regiment. Maintaining the mechs alone drained a lot money, but supporting all of the ships was even worse.
If Ves didn’t know anything better, then the Tarry region’s regional HQ wanted to dissolve the Vandals by starving it to death.
"It’s a good thing that we’re more resilient than that." The Journeyman Mech Designer grinned. "We slimmed down our ships and mechs, all of our mech pilots have taken pay cuts and steal everything we need from the Vesians when we’re short on something."
Still, financing an entire mech regiment through raiding planets and trade ships could only stretch so far. Most mech regiments would have collapsed eventually from the burden.
"Our budget declined year after year. Nothing we did could have changed our downward slide. The biggest burden by far is the cost of replacing aging mechs and ships. Even if we’re able to recoup most of the costs by recycling them, we were still bleeding a ton of money this way."
"Were?"
"That’s right. I didn’t misspoke. Ever since Colonel Lowenfield took over as our regimental commander some time ago, she made a clean sweep of our regiment. She cut down costs to the absolute minimum by trading away our only fleet carrier, letting go of as much support personnel as possible and shutting down all of our bases. Under her urging, we’ve completely transitioned into a nomadic fleet."
Relying on logistic ships such as the the Wolf Mother factory ship formed the core to their strategy. Though it cost a lot to maintain their operations, their ability to move with the fleet meant that the Vandals never had to worry about stretching their supply lines if they ever went deep into enemy space.
Ves felt a little nervous after hearing this. "You mean the Vandals bring the Wolf Mother along whenever they cross the border?"
"Exactly! She spends more time in the Vesia Kingdom than the Bright Republic even. We know the Kingdom inside-out and while the Vesians have caught us out a few times, we’ve always been able to get away."
"Has the regiment lost any logistic ships over the years."
"A handful of smaller vessels have succumbed to the enemy in recent times. They didn’t last very long under enemy fire."
Great. When Ves imagined serving in the Mech Corps as a mech designer, he always thought he would be put in some secret base deep underground. Serving aboard a moving factory ship was an entirely different matter altogether. The Vesians must be hunting for the Wolf Mother all the time.
Alloc briefly looked at the time. "That’s enough about the Vandals. We’ve got to get back to work. Ves, since you’re new, you should study the design files of the Hellcat first before you do anything else. The Hellcat is an exceedingly complex design, and were it not for your prior experience, I would have given you a refresher course instead."
Everyone turned around and went back to work. Alloc passed around a weathered data pad to Ves before he returned to debugging some piece of software.
Ves didn’t disturb the design team any further and sat down at a sofa pushed into a corner. He activated the data pad and began to study the confidential documents held within.
"So this is what the Hellcat looks like."
The Hellcat’s humanoid frame looked bulky but powerful. Its head was shaped like a lion, but that was the only reference to its name. The rest of the design evoked pure power due to the thickness of its armor and how many weapon systems it carried.
One arm carried a saber and the other arm carried a kite shield. The kite shield wasn’t all that thick and didn’t provide full coverage, but that lessened some of the weight concerns of the knight. The Hellcat compensated for the deficiency in the shield by bulking up its armor to the very limits of what was expected of medium mechs.
The Hellcat’s second weapon system consisted of a pair of wrist-mounted nail drivers. A nail driver was a rather exotic weapon that didn’t see much use. However, they packed a substantial kinetic punch without demanding too much space. Mech designers referred to them as the poor man’s railgun.
The pair of nail drivers wouldn’t be very accurate if fired from the arm of a hybrid knight, but they granted the Hellcat a potent close-ranged punch that would be useful in a variety of situations. The only downside to the nail driver was that it only carried three nails in its tiny magazine. Along with the nail in the chamber, a Hellcat could only output 8 nails in total before needing to reload, which turned out to be a massive pain for the mech pilot. Changing magazines in the thick of battle was impracticable at best.
Much like many other hybrid knights, the Hellcat also carried a pair of missile launchers on its shoulders. As a fairly low tech weapon system, it hardly looked special in his eyes. The true worth of a missile launcher lay in the missiles themselves.
Surprisingly, the Hellcat’s tube diameter diverged from the standard used by the Mech Corps. Each state used their own standards in order to prevent the enemy from using their own munitions against them. If the Vesians ever captured a couple of containers worth of missiles, they were better off recycling them than trying to modify them to fire out of their own missile tubes.
Adopting the enemy’s technical standard on a mech that was supposed to be the standard bearer of the Vandals said a lot about the regiment.
"The Flagrant Vandals can’t afford to ship in Republic-standard missiles, so they’re getting them from the Vesians instead."
It sounded crazy, but on second thought it was a brilliant design decision. The Flagrant Vandals spent a lot of time in Vesian space and frequently replenished their supplies by raiding enemy trade routes.
Since the Vesians loved to employ a lot of missiles, many of these convoys would be carrying tons of mass-produced missiles. Rather than destroy the shipment or recycle them down, the Vandals were better off if they made of them. This became especially attractive after months of moving behind enemy lines.
The only complication was that these missiles implemented safeguards that prevented them from exploding in the Mech Legion’s faces. The Vandals needed some time to crack these safeguards before they could put them into their own launcher tubes.
"A saber for close-ranged combat, a pair of nail drivers for close-to-medium ranged burst attacks and a pair of missile launchers to provide long-ranged suppression."
The weapons might be different, but the Hellcat pretty much adopted the weapon patterns as the Caesar Augustus and the Marc Antony. Many other Hybrid knight designs copied the same pattern to the point where it became a standard in the industry.
The Hellcat’s flight system was the last thing that grabbed his attention. Ves became impressed and concerned at its sheer size. It was about fifty percent bigger than any other flight system he had seen on a medium hybrid knight. It took a lot of power to keep them running for a decent stretch of time.
Ves turned to another file that detailed the internal architecture of the design.
It looked completely different from what he imagined.
Ves expected a crammed up interior where each part tried to squeeze out its neighbors. Much like the original Caesar Augustus, mechs needed to accommodate a lot more components if it wished to support so many weapon systems.
The internal architecture of the Hellcat turned around his expectations. The internal components took up much less space than he thought, which allowed the design to feature a high level of redundancy and compartmentalization.
The Hellcat was unimaginably tough. Its armor was thick enough to take a good beating, but its internals extended the durability of the mech by a significant amount.
Inside and out, the Hellcat put the original Caesar Augustus to shame.
How did the design team do it?
The secret quickly became evident.
"This is a really expensive design."
Ves performed some mental calculations. He took note of the material composition of the mech and ran the numbers on their cost. The raw materials required to fabricate a brand new Hellcat cost as much as 350 million credits at market prices!
That was as expensive as a heavy mech!
"This is a prestige mech!"
The Hellcat was a marvellous design that hid a lot of ingenious tricks and nuances that Ves didn’t fully understand. Professor Velten was a legitimate Senior Mech Designer, so the Hellcat’s design contained an invisible strength that brought out strength beyond what it materials should have been able to bring out.
Nevertheless, cheap materials could only be elevated up to a certain point. In order to meet the Hellcat design’s insane demands, Professor Velten resorted to powerful exotics that did more with less.
That came at an enormous cost. In fact, when Ves compared the performance of the Hellcat to an average heavy knight, he could hardly justify its existence.
"Why do the Vandals treasure the Hellcat over more practical designs?"
Heavy knights provided a lot more impact on the battlefield. Sure, they were too unwieldy to be used in space, but that was not a reason to develop an expensive boondoggle like the Hellcat.
The files failed to list any information that could satisfy his curiosity. Ves had enough of looking at the schematics. He needed to see some footage of the Hellcat in action.
When Ves asked Alloc to see some footage, the Journeyman immediately agreed to provide him with some footage.
"The footage is stored in the restricted archives, so you can’t access it from your comm or from the terminals in this room. The proper procedure would be to apply for access to a secure terminal in an isolated chamber. Normally, only Professor Velten can weigh on your request, but she handed me a lot of leeway in these matters."
Alloc quickly prepared a code and access pass for Ves. After pointing out where he could find the isolated chamber, he returned to work.
He used the pass to unlock the secure hatch and enter the barren but highly restricted chamber. A very visible laser turret constantly tracked his movements as he walked to the middle where he sat down on a stiff, metal chair.
After supplying the code into the terminal, the projector began to expand and run some footage of a battle that happened around four years ago. At that time, the Bright Republic was at peace and Ves was still studying at Ritterberg.
No one had a clue that a handful of combat carriers of the Flagrant Vandals penetrated the border and crossed several noble domains until it reached the interior of Vesian space.
Their target? A massive refinery complex in an otherwise quiet star system midway between the mines and nearby industrial planets. The complex orbited a rocky, broken planet that suffered numerous asteroid impacts hundreds of millions of years ago.
Most of those asteroids turned out to be made out of several exotics. These materials reacted with the minerals buried beneath the surface to produce a strange new substance that made for extremely flexible armor plating that performed well against kinetic impacts.
The footage started with the raid already in progress. The Railguns and lasers flew in each direction as several companies of the Vandals assaulted the defenses of a massive depot in a head-on collision.
What struck Ves the most was that the attackers hardly looked any different from the defenders! Much of the mechs used by the Flagrant Vandals actually consisted of a hodgepodge of distinctly Vesian designs!
The battle went well for the Vandals. They scoped out their target and gathered as much intelligence as possible before committing to the raid. They brought more than enough mechs to overwhelm the defenders.
Although the defenders possessed enough mechs to put up a stiff fight, they were chained to the refinery complex in orbit. Their static turrets fell like dominoes and their defensive positions started to crumble from the sheer amount of fire being thrown in their way.
The Vandals primarily made use of ballistic and kinetic weaponry. Though they wouldn’t be able to outlast a force that fielded mechs with laser weapons, their damage output was extremely high so long as they didn’t run out missiles.
Just as it looked as if their mechs would easily break through the defensive line, more than one-hundred Vesian mechs popped up from behind.
"Enemy reinforcements from the rear!"
"Where did they come from?!"
"We’ve got to get out of here!"
The Flagrant Vandals deliberately chose to attack a privately-owned refinery complex defended by nothing more than a company security force. The lightly populated star system shouldn’t have been able to support any other mech force, so the appearance of over a hundred additional mechs unsettled the Vandals.
"Calm down." A clipped and clinical female voice broke through the chaotic chatter. "They outnumber us, but won’t be able to match our grit. Gather the Hellcats!"
The woman began to issue a rapid set of orders that split them into two. Most of the Vandals continued to press against the complex, while a smaller portion of mechs looped around to face the incoming horde of mechs.
As the reinforcements came closer, the Vandals learned their makeup. Three-fourths of the incoming mechs consisted of frontline mechs while the remainder consisted of cheap melee mechs.
Facing them were twelve nearly identical Hellcats. All of them were piloted by officers or elites. Pulling them out of the assault on the complex risked delaying the breakthrough, but the Vandals had no other choice.
"Your orders?"
Colonel Lowenfield spoke for the first time since the start of the footage. "Meet the enemy reinforcements and smash them apart."
Her orders sounded simple and to the point. As Ves watched and listened to this record of past events, this was the first time he heard Colonel Lowenfield’s voice.
To his ears, she spoke without the usual force and gusto of mech pilots when they were on duty. She sounded like an office worker instead of a commanding officer.
Nevertheless, the lack of weight in her voice didn’t detract from her gravitas. The Vandals followed her orders without question, as if they had absolute fate in her leadership.
What Ves couldn’t understand was why she felt so confident about her Hellcats. Even though their performance was extremely good, sheer numbers always had a way of negating any advantage in quality.
"The disparity in quality is not enough to make up for the deficiency in numbers."
That was what Ves concluded if he applied the the conventional maxims. Any other commanding officer would have allocated at least thirty mechs against the incoming reinforcements.
As the fresh wave of Vesian mechs neared the battle site in orbit, the dozen hybrid knights prepared their missile launchers. The protective ports retracted, allowing the missiles to escape from the launchers and arc out into space.
The missile launchers carried by this older iteration of the Hellcat used larger mech-sized missiles. Each Hellcat only released twelve missiles each. Therefore, they only unleashed 144 missiles in their only volley.
Nevertheless, these missiles packed quite a punch. The reinforcing mechs must have recognized their own missiles because they quickly halted their forward acceleration and entered a defensive posture. Numerous lasers started firing from their formation in an attempt to shoot the missiles down.
It was tough going for the Vesian mechs because these large missiles incorporated many elements that made it more elusive.
For the most basic-level mech pilots that piloted the frontline mechs, their abysmal accurace insured that the chance of knocking down a missile was low. The only thing the reinforcements had going for them was their sheer weight of numbers.
More than half of the missiles got shot down by the sheer spread of fire, but that left a lot missiles alive. The Vesians barely had time to brace their mechs before the missiles impacted their frames.
"That was a good volley!"
"I love flinging their missiles back to them!"
None of the missiles carried enough force to destroy a mech outright, but all of the impacts succeeded in throwing the Vesians off-balance.
"Charge!"
The hybrid knights accelerated forward in a sluggish manner. Even though they carried proportionally huge flight systems, it took some time to get them going. However, once they built up a reasonable amount of speed relative to the Vesian formation, the amount of force they could produce upon impact was extremely serious.
Meanwhile, the Vesians just recovered from the missile salvo. The missiles outright disable four or so mechs while heavily damaging ten or so more. Every other mech only suffered scratches from the flying debris.
"Hellcats, charge formation!" The highest captain of the Hellcats ordered.
The hybrid knights adjusted into a V-shaped formation as they neared the Vesians. Both sides accelerated into each other, so the time before impact wouldn’t be very long.
The Vesians might have gotten an inkling of what they planned. Their legless spaceborn frontline mechs frantically opened fire at the incoming Hellcats. Many shots went wide but those that hit only added a couple more scratches to their armor and shields.
"Ready the nail drivers!"
The hybrid knights adjusted the grips of their sabers and shields and extended out the barrel of the nail driver poking out of their wrists.
"Aim at your designated targets!"
The captain transmitted a series of targeting instructions that focused everyone’s fire on a handful of important-looking mechs.
"Fire!"
The nail drivers emptied out their chamber, releasing a long and sharp nail that flew forward until it met the Vesians. Every mech that the captain targeted suffered a lot of damage. Many mechs flung backwards upon getting hit, and all of the nails that hit had been able to punch through their flimsy armor.
The Vesian formation fell into disarray yet again. The lead Hellcat officer successfully managed to take out the mechs that carried the officers in charge of the reinforcements.
Though the surviving officers of the Vesian reinforcements quickly imposed order, the damage was already done. Though they managed to reassert their formation, they hadn’t been able to retaliate as effectively.
The Hellcats spent the rest of their time on approach by emptying out their magazines at the enemy. Most of those nails hit as the fire hadn’t been concentrated on any single enemy mech. Instead, the scattered fire was meant to disarray the enemy formation and prevent them from bracing against the imminent collision!
"Bring it on!"
"Vandals Ever-burning!"
"Three, two, one, impact!"
"Yahoooooooo!"
Twelve spaceborn hybrid knights simultaneously tore through the mechs of the Vesians. The difference in mass proved to be decisive. The Hellcats bulled through several mechs with their kite shields held in front.
Though the shields quickly got dented, the Vesians completely didn’t know how to handle the sudden intrusion. They aimed their barrels at the hybrid knights in the midst of their formation but hesitated in pulling the trigger. Their formation was too packed. While that added to their cohesion, once the Vandals entered their midst, they risked missing the intruders and damage one of their fellow mechs instead.
"They’re dispersing!"
"It’s too late!"
The commanding officer of the Vesian reinforcements decisively ordered his mechs to split, but it was far too late for that. The Hellcats moved in unison as they mowed down mech after mech.
The Vesian frontline mechs never lasted more than a second up close while the Vesian melee mechs only delayed their destruction by a couple more seconds.
Mech after mech got cleaved apart by the brutal sabers wielded by the Hellcats. As the Vesians belatedly dispersed, the Vandal elites split up into two squads. Six mechs went high while the other went low.
Though splitting up into two squads of six wouldn’t allow them to catch all of the Vesian mechs, they still exhibited strength beyond what their numbers suggested.
"Hybrid knights are shock weapons." Ves realized as he watched the Hellcats make a mockery out of a Vesian force that outnumbered them.
Though this force was fairly shabby, Ves still found it impressive that the Hellcats managed to route the mob without sustaining any losses.
"Very interesting."
After smashing the reinforcements, the Vandals easily broke through the orbital complex and stole all of its inventory before breaking it up and sending the pieces into an inescapable descent to the rocky planet below.
The key takeaway of the footage was the way the Vandals used the Hellcats. Though they would usually be dispersed among the rest of the Vandals, whenever the commanding officer needed it, he or she could easily order them to form up in a single group of Hellcats.
Several Hellcats working together was a lot stronger than he thought. Naturally, much of the victory was achieved due to the disparity quality between the two forces. The Hellcats didn’t fight against the Mech Legion. If Ves had to guess, the reinforcements looked a lot like mercenaries.
This was also why the Hellcats proved to be so effective. The Vandals mainly raided enemy infrastructure. The weren’t meant to go toe-to-toe with the Mech Legion, the Vesian premiere mech force.
The Mech Legion was famous for their high morale and their willingness to fight to the death, but the outfits that did business in the Kingdom’s private sector was made out of much less sterner stuff.
"It’s much more efficient for the Vandals to attack their morale. As long as the Hellcats deliver a sufficiently great shock, they’ll be able to route any number of inferior mechs."
Outfits in the private sector never fought to the death. As long as they glimpsed a hint of defeat, they wouldn’t hesitate in running away.
Ves only needed to witness a single battle to understand the characteristics of the Hellcat design.
Even though its design appeared to be a little scattered, in actual fact it prioritized one capability above all others.
"The entire frame is built to deliver a devastating collision attack."
The schematics and material composition prioritized sturdiness and shock resistance. It insured that even if the hybrid knight built up a lot of speed, it wouldn’t fall apart as soon as it collided with another mech. Even the shield that looked a little small for a knight hid a surprising amount of resilience.
The additional weapon systems facilitated this mode of combat. They were meant to soften up the enemy and disrupt them from meeting the Hellcats in a prepared formation.
"That’s why these Hellcats don’t carry much ammunition around. They’re only designed to deliver one big whallop before they close in with their shields and sabers."
Still, for a highly advanced mech that incorporated many ingenuities, its design was also surprisingly one-dimensional. Its strengths were evident, but that only magnified its weaknesses.
The biggest and most egregious fault spoke for itself. "The Hellcat is too heavy."
Spaceborn mechs relied on speed and acceleration to move around in the vast void of space and to dodge most of the attacks fired in their direction. An exception existed for knights, but usually mech designers exerted their utmost to minimizing their weight.
The less they weighed, the easier it was to change their direction on the fly.
Right now, the Hellcat resembled a transport ship in its movement characteristics. It weighed a lot and though it possessed a larger flight system compared to other medium mechs, the increase in propulsion force couldn’t keep up.
"This mech is as heavy as a Caesar Augustus."
The same weight on a landbound mech like the Caesar Augustus played to its advantages. Locomotion on land demanded much less of a mech. The weight might slow it down, but it also added weight to its movements and allow it to anchor itself into place whenever it received a mighty impact.
In space, this weight came with much more downsides. The amount of time needed to adjust the Hellcat’s inertia was at least twice as long as a conventional space knight. This difference was quite massive when it came to fast-paced battles such as smaller skirmishes in space.
Essentially, this meant that the Hellcat excelled in larger battles where they faced company-sized forces and more. "It’s not a duelist mech, that’s for sure."
The second major downside to the Hellcat design was its lack of staying power. Every part in its design cranked up as much power as they could possibly unleash without degrading their longevity by too much. Even with light and careful use of this mech, it would eventually by itself within a decade.
The Hellcat simply demanded too much out of itself.
Naturally, the upside to this was that the mech pilots could be assured of the best performance possible whenever they committed to the battle. Before that, they needed to carefully conserve their Hellcats in order to prevent them from running out of steam before the decisive moment came.
Mechs designed to stay in reserve and exert their full power in a single maneuver had always existed, but they never went to such extremes. The mech industry had a moniker for mechs like that.
"A prestige mech. It’s the parade horse of the regiment."
What Ves meant by that was that the Hellcat served a dual purpose. It broke through stalemates and reversed unfavorable situations not only through its objective performance characteristics, but also through shaping everyone’s perceptions.
The Hellcat was a standard bearer and the trump card of the Flagrant Vandals. Every mech pilot that fought alongside a Hellcat would receive a boost in morale. On the opposite end, enemies that recognized the Hellcat and everything it represented must be feeling a little suppressed.
In truth, the Hellcat’s ability to boost to friendly morale and damage enemy morale was much more important than the material damage it could unleash.
By delivering an overwhelming impact in a single moment, it exceeded the limit of how much enemy pilots could deal with.
If the Hellcat exhibited a more gradual performance curve, while it would be able to last much longer in a battle, the shock to the enemy wouldn’t be as potent.
Ves understood the challenges faced by the Hellcat design team. With only five Apprentices and one Journeyman working full-time on this design, hardly any progress could be made. The Hellcat’s design was simply too complex.
After returning to his team, Ves began to integrate himself with the team. Over the course of several days, Alloc taught him his responsibilities and what kind of expectations the design team shouldered.
"The Hellcat is not a fixed design like you see with private sector mechs." The Journeyman patiently explained. "Mechs in the military can come in many different variants. You can see it as a cross between updating an old design and modifying an existing design. For minor changes, we don’t bother fabricating new mechs, but apply them to existing mechs. This way, we can be sure that they possess the right configuration to deal with their upcoming missions."
"How many brand-new mechs are fabricated in a year?"
"Not as much as you think. The Flagrant Vandals have learned how to be frugal. You’ll have to take that into account when you do your work. You need to incorporate some tolerances and account for the most common cases of wear and tear. This is because our mech technicians reuse as much old components as they can get away with it. Professor Velten is watching out for this so you don’t have to be too concerned."
Alloc also explained the nature of the work being sent in his way. Predictably, the Journeyman didn’t think much of Ves and his abilities. After hearing that Ves excelled in physics and was passable in a couple of other areas, the seasoned mech designer dumped some trivial assignments onto his lap.
"Our design team is short-handed and the Hellcat needs tons of tweaks. Whenever Professor Velten and I introduce a major change in the Hellcat’s design, the knock-on effects are numerous. Many components are affected, some for the better and some for the worse. Your responsibility as an Apprentice is to record and quantify these effects, and whenever possible provide a suggestion on how we can mitigate the detrimental side effects."
While Alloc sounded solemn and made his task sound important, Ves knew he was being pushed aside to the kids table.
Still, Ves had only just arrived. He wasn’t arrogant enough to believe he could outmatch an actual Journeyman who was deeply familiar with the design in question.
He adopted a humble posture and did his best to reign in his arrogance. "Understood, sir. I’ll get right on the job."
Ves spent the next couple of weeks keeping his head down and doing what he was told. To be frank, the makework he received required hardly any thought at all. Most of the time, he inputted some settings in a mathematical model and let a portion of the Wolf Mother’s immense processors simulate the outcome.
Someone less knowledgeable than him might need hours to come up with the right settings and determine which models to use, but to Ves that was as easy as breathing air. He even showed some initiative by adjusting some of the math behind the models to best suit the exact conditions of where the Hellcat would be deployed.
The nature of his work meant that Ves mostly waited around for the processors to spit out their data. He idled around and looked at the others who worked with utmost concentration on their own assignments.
As the new kid on the block, the other Apprentices didn’t know what to make of him yet. In their off-time, they were usually too tired to socialize a lot. A complex design like the Hellcat required at least twenty mech designers to achieve stable amount of progress. All of that work that should have been carried out by twenty Apprentices was actually being shouldered by only five Apprentices.
Ves did not downplay his abilities, but neither did he call out too much attention. He merely accepted every task sent in his way and completed it a little bit faster than anyone else could manage. The only reason why he couldn’t solve the problems instantly was because he couldn’t do anything to speed up the simulations.
The processors only provided so much processing power to him. The massive factory ship needed to reserve the bulk of her calculations to her other operations.
Still, Ves believed his performance exceeded expectations. He hoped that Alloc would notice and entrust him with more meaty tasks, but he was all out of luck in that regard. Alloc was fully preoccupied in his own responsibilities for the moment, and until he finished his current assignments, he wouldn’t pay attention to anything else.
All of the other Apprentices in his design team was too self-absorbed in their own work, so the only people Ves could really talk to were the other Apprentices from Bentheim.
One day, Laida, Pierce and Ves gathered in a canteen adjacent to the labs. As they filled up their stomachs, they talked about their work.
"The permanent mech designers don’t take us temps very seriously." Pierce complained. "It’s not our fault we haven’t spent years obsessing over a single mech model line!"
Laida agreed with the sentiment. "They don’t expect very much from us. The mech designers who arrived a little earlier from the Rittersberg region are in the same boat. They’re even keeping secrets from us!"
That was the most annoying fact about their work. The design teams expected them to understand the designs they worked with and become familiar with their characteristics. However, while they had access to the top-level schematics, they couldn’t access the details to the proprietary systems.
For example, Ves couldn’t find out the exact material composition of the armor and the internal support structure. Neither would he be able to study the designs of key components such as the engine and power reactor in great detail.
The software he worked with treated these elements as black boxes. Ves was allowed to work with them as a whole as part of modelling their performance, but he wasn’t allowed to tinker their internal makeup.
"It’s understandable why they chose to compartmentalize their proprietary knowledge." Ves responded neutrally. "We’re newcomers and we won’t be sticking around for long. Compared to careerists like them who have volunteered to serve the Mech Corps for decades, conscripted mech designers like us are unreliable."
That depressed the mood in the table. None of them like to waste their time here. Working in a design team of the Mech Corps was both an obligation and an opportunity. They could not only access a lot of textbooks and teaching materials depending on their merits, they could also play around with the immense amount of proprietary technology developed in-house.
Many of the implementations used by the Mech Corps would not show up in the MTA’s catalog of licenses because the Mech Corps didn’t license any of their advancements. Sure, much of what they developed could be replicated with a similar enough license, but a standard solution from the market would not be tailored to the exact situation at hand.
"We should try to make the best of things." Ves said. He spoke the same words to Carlos a few months ago. "At the end of our service period, what did we get out of this unique time in our lives? I don’t want to look back and conclude that we missed out on treasures that we can only obtain in our time here."
While Laida and Pierce both expressed their frustrations, they didn’t possess the spine to assert themselves. Not that Ves was anything different at this point, but his ambitions would eventually drive him to greater things.
His words served as a reminder to them to not be content with their current status and miss out on the benefits that they could grasp. Certainly, every temporary mech designer needed to play the long game here and work themselves into the system without stepping on everyone else’s toes.
"Did you hear? The Wolf Mother is almost done with harvesting the asteroids in this system. It’s about to rendez-vous with the main fleet of the Vandals."
Life aboard the Wolf Mother did not seem so hectic to Ves. He spent most of his time in the compartment assigned to the design department. This only took up a fraction of the space aboard the massive factory ship.
The factory ship was like a city compressed into a capital ship. It housed thousands of servicemen and devoted caverns of space to the industry of keeping the Vandals afloat.
A lot of responsibility rested on the shoulders of the Wolf Mother. While it wasn’t unheard of for vagabond outfits to pursue a nomadic lifestyle aboard their ships, in the Komodo Star Sector, it was rarely seen on this scale.
From the basic information that Ves received on the factory ship, she used to start off as a smaller logistics ship. After some time, the voracious demands of the Flagrant Vandals necessitated further expansion.
Modules kept being added along her hull. The rising demand for services caused the Vandals to expand the capabilities of the logistics ship to a reckless extent. More asteroid breakers, more refineries, more alloy forge, more repair bays.
The expansion never ended, though it slowed down at this point due to physical constraints. The shipwrights among the Vandals did their best to accommodate the expansions. They strengthened the hull, overhauled the internal structure and sized up the essential components such as the power reactor, the thrusters and the FTL drive.
Ships of the Wolf Mother’s current size were hardly seen in the Komodo Star Sector. Further expansion necessitated an essential upsizing to her FTL engine, something which could not be done by in a third-rate state like the Bright Republic. Only the Hexadric Hegemony and the Friday Coalition could afford to field capital ships of that scale.
In truth, it was cheaper to maintain a single base on an asteroid or an abandoned moon. Running a ship came with its own costs, and a vessel that ballooned to such a size must be using up an enormous amount of power and fuel each day.
Yet that was also the genius of it. The capability to move their main logistical base around gave the Vandals unparalleled flexibility in their deployments. From the stories he heard, the Vandals became famous even before the outbreak of the current war for their deep raids. They struck Vesian star systems situated well within the Kingdom’s interior are fleeced their complacent industries to the bone.
While this sounded impressive and commendable, not everyone in the Mech Corps thought so. People would hardly be able to distinguish them from pirates, and their conduct of sneaking around to attack the weakest parts of the Vesians was seen as dishonorable.
While the warrior culture of the Mech Corps allowed for clever tricks and strategies to defeat an enemy force with ease, the Flagrant Vandals took it too far. The shamelessness in which the Vandals avoided standing battles against the Mech Legion led to their estrangement from the conventional military order of the Republic.
A mech pilot of the Vandals regarded themselves as Vandals and not as a serviceman of the Mech Corps. This was a problem, because the mech pilots who served in any other regiment held loyalty to both without any conflict.
Occasionally, Ves heard some talk of that nature whenever he ate in the canteen. Mech designers only made up part of its clientele. A lot of crewmen working in the nearby compartments ate their meals in this canteen.
"We’re Vandals, not soldiers."
"Leave the heavy fighting for the big boys."
"I heard they’re downgrading our paychecks again. As if they couldn’t get any lower!"
"Damn, what are the field marshals up to? They’re letting the Vesians intrude upon our territory for the umpteenth time. When will they ever have the guts to hit them back?!"
"Hah, we’re the only ones who give a damn about that. We might as well be an alien species to the big chiefs."
Talk like this was a bad indication of how far the Vandals became estranged to the Republic. The Tarry region was already isolated enough, and this undercurrent of resentment posed a lot of risks to the Mech Corps.
Maybe it was the Larkinson within him, but no one else shared his concerns. Outsiders like Pierce and Laida didn’t know anything better, but for Ves who grew up with the Larkinsons, some of the talk sounded outright mutinous.
"You know, won’t things be better if we just pack up and go?"
"Whadda ya mean?"
"Think about it. What has the Republic ever done for us? We built up the Vandals all by ourselves without a single credit from the state. We worked hard to pay for what we got, so how are we any different from a mercenary corps? If you think about it, we’re actually worse than mercs. At least they get paid, whereas we get nothing at all!"
"That’s not entirely true. We still have access to their facilities and their database. We couldn’t have gotten this far without all of the advanced technology at our fingertips."
"I still think we should make a getaway. It would be easy as pie. We aren’t anchored by any planets. Those with families who live on the surface of one can just take them along for the ride when we leave Republic space."
"It does sound easy. Getting cut off from the data banks will hurt us hard, but the Wolf Mother has a lot of life in her yet."
This was merely a sample of the talk that sometimes popped up from the lowest ranks of spacers. It did not mean their officers or the mech pilots fostered the same ideas. Without a better exposure of life among the Vandals, Ves couldn’t make any definite conclusions.
It still looked bad though. The canteen was surely monitored. Why hadn’t any officers come and reprimanded the spacers?
"Maybe they don’t care."
The crewmen aboard the Wolf Mother could be extremely dedicated to the Vandals and did their utmost to keep the Wolf Mother running. Yet they could also be extremely lethargic when it came to the rest of the Mech Corps.
The only person who could make or break this regiment was the elusive Colonel Lowenfield. Despite her name popping up everywhere in every important event in the last few years, Ves still had no clue what made her so respected among the Vandals.
"Did you hear? The colonel has recalled all of the detachments. We’re almost done with our repairs and resupply."
"Oh, finally! I’m bored to tears staying in this noname star system. I want to see some action!"
"Me too! There’s always a good score to be found when we shear the wool off the Vesian sheep. I’m broke and need more money!"
Ves shook his head and finished his meal before returning to the labs. He returned to his terminal only to see that the simulations in the queue needed another hour to complete.
He still had some free time on his hands.
He was pretty much the only person who enjoyed this privilege. A less capable mech designer would have spent a couple of hours trying to get the settings right or spend many late nights on interpreting the data.
The workload put into his lap could not keep up with his capabilities. If not for Alloc’s current preoccupation with getting the software right for the Hellcat, then he might have been more attentive to how fast Ves completed his work.
Ves quietly sighed. He looked around and saw that one of the mech designers had left.
While everyone except Ves constantly faced a mountain of work, it was important for the mech designer to keep in touch with how the mechs performed for real. Occasionally, Alloc assigned a mech designer to liaise with the mech technicians and the mech pilots that worked with the Hellcats. They mostly gathered feedback and measured the state of the existing Hellcat mechs.
He wanted to come into contact with the mechs as well, if only to get out of this tiny corner of the Wolf Mother. Ves had never seen a true Hellcat mech and that hampered his work somewhat. Other mech designers might be fine with a bunch of technical documents, but much of what made his work great was his feel for the intangible qualities of a mech.
Within a day or two, the Wolf Mother finally moved. She first exited the asteroid belt and headed towards the border of the lifeless star system with a couple of escorting combat carriers in tow. Once they reached the edge of the system, they transitioned into FTL.
The entire factory ship bucked and groaned while Ves momentarily lurched when that happened.
"Oof!"
The other mech designers laughed. "The first time is always the worst!"
Ves rubbed his head for a bit. The moment the factory ship entered FTL, Ves felt as if a nail had been driven through his skull. "How come it’s so painful? It is safe to be aboard the ship when it enters FTL?"
"This is normal to us." Alloc answered gently. "You have to keep in mind that the Wolf Mother expanded in an ad-hoc fashion. There was hardly any planning involved. Slapping modules onto her hull without restraint has made the Wolf Mother rather unstable. The Wolf Mother’s FTL drive is barely rated to carry along a ship of her size and mass. Some kinks are to be expected."
In other words, the FTL drive could barely cope. The worst case scenario was that it might eventually break from the all of the strain.
Bad things happened when FTL drives blew apart, especially when the ship was still in FTL.
Only a handful times did ships drop out of FTL after their drives became inactive. Most of the time, something freaky would happen and the rest of the galaxy never saw the ship again.
"How well is the FTL drive protected?"
"Oh, the Vandals aren’t unaware of dangers posed by a faulty FTL drive. They’ve put their best engineers to keeping it in shape. There’s also a lot of security surrounding this component. Nobody can wander in and do what they want with this critical part of the ship."
That might protect the FTL drive from boarding troops and internal sabotage, but it did not help the Wolf Mother’s inherent vulnerability to outside attacks. She was not a ship meant for battle.
Therefore, the recent orders concerned Ves a bit. Heading deep into Vesian space was a perilous matter even in times of peace. There was always the risk of getting tracked down by a dogged Vesian task force on its way to the frontline.
Ves id not know whether to see it as a good thing or bad thing, but it was undeniable that he would be able to grasp a lot more opportunities in that case. His time with the Vandals might stretch for years, so he would have plenty of time to ingratiate himself with the crew.
"Ves, are you available?" One of the young men looked around for help and saw that Ves was basically daydreaming behind his terminal. "I need some help with this stupid equation. I followed all of the instructions according to the handbook but the simulations are getting out of whack."
"Show me what’s the problem."
This was the first time someone asked him for help. The three permanent Apprentice Mech Designers often consulted among themselves and never asked Ves or the other designer from Rittersberg for any input.
Vse took a look at the model and spotted the problem at first glance. "It’s no wonder your simulation delivers such a nonsensical result. There’s nothing wrong with the equations or the model. It’s this bad set of data that is at the root of the problem. This is a typical case of garbage in, garbage out. Look at the input data. Do these measurements seem correct to you?"
The mech designer worked with actual measurements taken from a previous visit to the mechs. Whoever took these measurements made a mistake somewhere down the line.
Once Ves pointed out the problem, the mech designer could handle the rest. The young man nodded at Ves with a modicum of respect this time.
As Ves wandered back to his terminal to go back to his daydreams, he smiled in satisfaction.
"It starts with small steps."
Every time the Wolf Mother transitioned in and out of FTL, the entire deck lurched and a nauseous feeling overcame Ves. He never really got used to it, but the other mech designers in the design department shrugged it off like they got sprayed by mist.
The Wolf Mother already transitioned over seven times. From this, Ves could infer that either the range of the Wolf Mother’s FTL drive was really short, or they traversed a huge distance.
The Vandals didn’t release a lot of information to someone low in the totem pole like Ves. He learned more from eavesdropping the spacers in the canteen than in the pathetic amount of documents made available to him. The most he knew about the layout of the factory ship came from contingency plans in case of disaster, and they only outlined the most direct path to the escape pods.
What he did learn from from listening in on the crew was that the factory ship’s exhibited an onion ring-like shape. The original logistics ship that formed the core had already been changed beyond recognition, but most of the central functioning of the Wolf Mother was buried here. It contained the databases, the processors, the combat information center and many more goodies.
Tacked on to the top, bottom, port, starboard, bow and stern of the original structure were many other modules. For example, the compartments that made up of engineering took over the entire rear end of the Wolf Mother. Those who entered this section in person described it as a chimera of ship components that kept the factory ship up and running.
One day, Professor Velten called up every mech designer in the department for a general meeting. Ves filed into the conference room after the others and sat on a random chair in the rear. The room could have housed over a hundred mech designers.
With only sixteen people present, the place had obviously seen better times.
"It is the time for our monthly update. For the six of you who transferred in recently, this meeting serves to bring us all on the same page." The old woman nodded to Ves and the other temps. "Let us begin with everyone’s works. Journeymen, please present your progress."
The Journeyman Mech Designers who led their individual design teams walked up to the front and projected their results. Ves watched keenly as he got to see the details of the other two actively developed designs.
The 6th Flagrant Vandals started up as a spaceborn mech regiment in order to raid Vesian shipping lines. Only later on did they acquire the capability to field mechs on land.
Still, spaceborn combat remained the norm among the Vandals as most of the time they couldn’t afford to stick around a star system long enough to go through the trouble of descending and ascending from orbit.
The most widely-used design in active development was therefore the Inheritor line of spaceborn light skirmishers. Their small stature enabled the Vandals to fabricate them fast and cheap from the Wolf Mother’s own production lines. Their simple nature also lowered the burden of training rookie pilots into becoming proficient in piloting these mechs.
"We failed to find any means to reduce the weight of the cockpit by zero-point-three percent while retaining the same level of protection. I have personally tried to vary different shapes and sizes, but the current iteration is already highly optimised. Tweaking the ratios of the alloys used to construct the cockpit has led to a minor amount of weight savings, but will also weaken the cockpit by a disproportionate amount."
As the Journeyman in charge of its development reported on his team’s progress, Ves understood more of the nuances of its design. The Inheritor aimed to be fast. It had to be nimble enough to turn on the fly and powerful enough to accelerate to a great speed. The Inheritor relied on these strengths to close the distance quickly and tear apart vulnerable ranged mechs with its twin knives.
This was extremely hard to accomplish on a light mech which needed to devote a substantial amount of internal volume to its flight system.
"How much progress have you accomplished in decreasing the size of the Inheritor’s flight system?" Velten asked from the side.
"We accomplished a little bit more in that area. The Mech Corps recently released new formulas for alloys and composite materials. I’ve selected the formulas that are most compatible to the Inheritor’s flight system and tried to simulate what would happen if we substitute the old formulas with the new ones. Most outcomes didn’t come out in our favor, but I’ve tasked my team to tweak the design in order to provide a better fit for the new formulas. These results look more promising, as you can see on this projection."
Ves paid a lot of attention on this particular topic. He lacked first-hand experience in working with actual flight systems. Working with outdated flight systems for virtual mechs didn’t count in his eyes.
He noticed that every other mech designer paid a lot of attention as well. In a way, this was a valuable opportunity for the Apprentices to listen in to the insights of a Journeyman Mech Designer.
As Ves learned more about the development process of the Inheritor, he found out that the current state of the Inheritor was in a very good place. Its relative lack of complexity made it easier to tweak some of its elements without throwing everything else into chaos.
Of course, the mech designers faced many limitations as well. They weren’t allowed to exceed the Inheritor’s mass and volume, no matter how much of an improvement they achieved. This truly frustrated the designers who worked on the Inheritor because they accumulated a list of over a hundred easy changes they could implement if only the Vandals relaxed the restrictions.
"To sum up my report, I truly believe it will benefit the Vandals if we can convince Colonel Lowenfield to agree to a two-point-five percent increase in mass and three-point-seven percent increase in volume for the Inheritor design. There are so many new innovations just waiting to be implemented."
Professor Velten nodded gently. "I will take your words under advisement in my next meeting with the colonel."
In other words, nothing would change and the status quo persisted. The Journeyman must have realized it as well and looked deflated as he returned to his seat.
Another Journeyman went up to report on the work done on the Akkara line of heavy landbound mechs.
The 6th Flagrant Vandals predominantly used Vesian mechs, which was very unusual for a mech regiment of the Republic. They didn’t buy these mechs from the market and neither did they fabricate them in-house.
Instead, they stole the brand-new machines by raiding mech manufacturers or scavenged damaged ones from battles. The Vandals had become so adept at sourcing mechs in this manner that they stopped ordering mechs from the Mech Corps entirely.
There was only one downside. They couldn’t get their hands on any heavy mechs.
Only a proper military force fielded heavy mechs. To the Vandals, they could only obtain Vesian heavy mechs by raiding military bases or attack proper Vesian mech regiments.
The Vandals would be crazy to do so. The losses they’d sustain in any single assault wouldn’t make up for the acquisition of a couple of heavy mechs.
So, as burdensome as it sounded, the Vandals had to continue to develop their own heavy mech design.
"We’ve finally solved the air intake issue for cycling the heat build-up. It turns out that the filters we placed to protect the mechanisms aren’t coping too well when it comes to moisture in the air."
Compared to the more polished state of the Inheritor design, the Akkara appeared to be a lot less refined. The development problems outlined by the Journeyman sounded a lot more basic and impactful. They weren’t dealing with a highly optimised design. The Akkara was still a work in progress.
"We are still unable to determine whether it is better to stick with the older targeting system that is relatively reliable or the newer one that is made available by the Mech Corps."
"What are the issues with the new system?" Velten asked.
"The newer targeting system isn’t interfacing properly with our design. We don’t know why, but I think it’s because the Akkara possesses a lot more gun tubes than it can cope."
The Akkara heavy mech was a landbound mech that weighed so much that the Vandals never moved them from beyond their landing sites. As the only heavy mech of the Vandals, the Akkara distinctly served a defensive role.
On land, the Akkara’s moved on four legs to provide a stable firing platform. Dozens of rapid-fire laser and ballistic cannons dotted its spider-shaped torso, allowing it to bombard anything that approach from the ground and air.
A special feature of the Akkara was that it served as a weapon platform in space as well. Its heavy design incorporated some of the traits more often seen on spaceborn mechs.
This allowed the Akkara mechs to stay relevant in space battles as well. Every Vandal combat carrier incorporated special bunkers that enabled the Akkara to anchor its four legs into the bunker structure and fire out its weapons from the well-placed slits.
"We’ve experimented with changing the layout of the cannon barrels, and have come up with three alternatives that should better balance out the stresses placed upon the mech whenever it fires off its ballistic cannons. One solution is better for land and the other is better for space."
Balancing out the Akkara’s performance on land and in space demanded a lot from its design. Ves didn’t envy their design team, because optimizing the mech for one environment often compromised its performance in the other environment.
Once the Journeyman listed out a bevy of solutions, Alloc finally made his way up to the front.
"My team has not made any significant improvements to the Hellcat design."
With those words, Alloc laid out the reasons why, though Ves already predicted them. The spaceborn hybrid knight incorporated too many systems. Thereby, a change in one system affected the performance of the others, often in a detrimental way. This was a classic reason why hybrid knights hadn’t become more prolific.
"Lately, my work on drawing out more strength from the Hellcat design through tweaking its software has met a wall. I’ve already worked extensively in this area and most of my progress in the last few months represent the easy solutions. Any further improvement requires an exorbitant amount of time to dig up."
Velten honed in on this remark. "So you believe it is no longer worth your time to work on the programming of the Hellcat?"
"It is not cost-effective. All the bugs that I could think of have been squashed or circumvented. Any further improvements demands lots of research. My time is better spent on other things."
"Very well then. If you believe there is no further merit to put your attention in this area, then you may change your focus. What do you have in mind?"
"We are still working on strengthening and miniaturizing its oversized flight system. Our core issue with the flight system is that it generates a large amount of heat, something which our hybrid knight has never really learned to cope with. I’d like to take a stab at improving its heat management systems."
The professor nodded in approval. "Research our options and present them to me in private. I’ll derive a change in the Hellcat’s design according to the data that you present to me. Continue on with the report."
The rest of the report sounded familiar to Ves, as he worked on them himself or helped his colleagues solve some of their conundrums about them. The Hellcat design still hid a lot of secrets, but Ves already understood the broad strokes.
After Alloc finished his presentation and returned to his seat, Professor Velten went up again and made an announcement.
"Pardon the secrecy that is hanging over the department. We needed to make sure that Colen Lowenfield’s plans for the Wolf Mother hasn’t leaked."
Everyone looked at each other in a worried manner. "Ma’am? Where are we right now?"
"That’s a good question." Velten smiled. "The Wolf Mother has just arrived at Tomalin System. There is nothing special about this star system. It is an out of the way location in the Tarry region. The reason why it is our focus is because we are about to meet with the Vesian rebels."
Everyone was taken aback at the news. They were actually collaborating with rebels this time!
"As you may have heard, the 3rd Imodris Legion inflicted substantial damage to the Bright Republic’s morale. Although the Republic can cope with the material damage of their raids, it is much harder to restore the hearts of our citizens. The Mech Corps therefore expects the Flagrant Vandals to pay back the Vesians in kind. Colonel Lowenfield has therefore decided to pay back the 3rd Imodris Legion in kind by striking at their dukedom."
This alarmed Ves and some of the others because Imodris was a prosperous dukedom situated in the interior of the Vesia Kingdom. The Vandals would not only have to cross the border, they also needed to hop from star system to star system without revealing their presence inside Vesian space.
That was almost impossible to accomplish.
The moment the Vesians detected their presence within the border, they would surely dispatch a hunting party to the Vandals. Owing to their territorial advantage, the Vesians have an easier time to surround the Vandals than the latter slipping the noose and returning to Republic space.
"In the short but illustrious history of the Flagrant Vandals, our regiment has deployed to Imodris several times. Each time the alert garrisons of Imodris detected us quickly, sparking harrowing fights where we broke through the blockades at heavy costs. While the colonel does not intend to flinch from Imodris, neither can we afford to make the same bull-headed approach."
Therefore, the Vandals cultivated some relations among the rebels.
"With the help of the so-called Vesian Revolutionary Front, Colonel Lowenfield is confident we can circumvent the strict Vesian monitoring in their desolate star systems and approach a highly industrialized planet without any forewarning."
In other words, it was like breaking into a heavy defended mansion by bribing the butler into letting them in. The risks and perils of such a move could be imagined.
Perhaps the ultimate plan was a little more elaborate, but from what Ves heard so far, many things could go wrong.
The first and most important they should ask was whether they could trust the rebels to keep their word.
Professor Velten didn’t reveal too much about this. "The colonel is handling it. We have collaborated with this group of revolutionaries before, and they have been proven to be reliable as long as they are handsomely paid. Admittedly, this raiding expedition can’t compare to the minor border incursions we collaborated on before."
From Professor Velten’s description, the VRF didn’t sound like much.
As a monarchy in a time where humans advanced to a point where they settled half the galaxy, their existence was very controversial.
Those who grew up in the kingdoms and empires usually took their existence for granted, but those who grew up in Republics and other forms of non-hereditary governments thought of monarchies as backwards.
This last point was a generalisation, not an absolute. This meant that not every Vesian believed in letting a bunch of spoiled and entitled nobles and royals dictate every facet of their lives.
A governance system where a small number won big would always present a lot of losers. Those who suffered directly from the injustices within the kingdom eventually formed several resistance groups.
True to their chaotic nature and their rejection of strong authority, they couldn’t manage to form a united front. The VRF was one of the only rebel groups that still worked to unite the different resistance movements together. They achieved limited success in this area as many groups only paid lip service to this ideal.
Nevertheless, it could not be denied that the VRF was well-connected. However, this also increased the risk of cooperating with them. The Vandals not only needed to trust the VRF, they also had to put faith in their ability to persuade the local rebel movements into facilitating this risky operation.
"As of now, the Wolf Mother will enter into an elevated state of readiness. Contact with the outside galaxy will be even more restricted than before, so our database will no longer receive any updates from the central database maintained by Mech Corps. Keep this in mind when you work on the designs. You will not be able to rely on recent innovations to solve your problems."
Half of the mech designers in the room groaned. Quite a few of them managed to solve long-standing problems by applying something that wasn’t possible before. Cutting off the updates to the database forced them to revisit old methods and try to get them to work. This was extremely slow and frustrating work.
"Professor?" Someone asked. "What kind of tweaks do we have to make to ready our mechs for the coming battle?"
"Good question. While I am unable to inform you of our target, I am still allowed to relay some conditions. First, the star system is heavily defended from space, but the Vesians pulled half of the defending mechs to reinforce the frontlines. What remains of its garrisons consist of reserves, much of them recruited from the local population."
This was an important detail.
"The planet in question isn’t being run very well. The nobles in charge are decadent and the planet has been running a deficit for years. The planetary administration is forced to skimp on their services, which has made much of the underclass very mad. It’s a breeding ground for rebels, and the VRF thinks they can convince the local rebels into disabling some of the local defenses in orbit and letting us in."
This time, Ves raised his hand and asked a question. "Ma’am, why would the local rebels agree to let their home planet suffer? Won’t we be making things worse for them by raining down death and destruction?"
"That is a valid point to make." The professor nodded, yet waved her hand dismissively. "We have made the appropriate precautions. We are more than aware of the risks and we know more about the Vesia Kingdom than most of their citizens. Almost everyone in this state has a bone to pick with someone else. This is nothing new for us."
The Flagrant Vandals hadn’t run amuck in enemy space without learning a thing or two about their enemy. Although most of the time they operated alone, sometimes they cooperated with the local factions if they needed access to a sensitive area.
Although Professor Velten didn’t intimate anything of the sort, Ves read more from her answer and the way she chose to answer it than she wanted to reveal.
If Ves wasn’t wrong, one of the major reasons the Vandals stayed afloat up until now was because it also collaborated with the noble factions!
Though Ves kept his expressions neutral, inwardly he felt shocked at the audacity of it all. He would bet that no one in high command even knew about this! What would the Mech Corps think if one of their mech regiments collaborated directly with a faction of the Kingdom?
The news alone would shock the entire Republic!
Professor Velten couldn’t blame his level of observation. Ves heard many stories about some of the murkier deeds of the Mech Corps from his father and the other Larkinsons. Even then, none of those tales matched the brazenness in which the Vandals shook hands with the Vesians.
Ves guessed that the Vandals only cooperated in an opportunistic fashion. The rivalry among the Vesian nobles was legendary, and the Vandals probably presented themselves to discontented nobles as a convenient way to ruin their rivals.
As the meeting wrapped up, Professor Velten called up the Journeymen to hold a more private discussion while letting the Apprentices enjoy a rare break.
Ves, Laida and Pierce gathered around in a corner turned into a makeshift lounge area. A couple of comfortable chairs and sofas provided an oasis of calm during the most frustrating moments of work.
Pierce looked at Ves and Laida with a questioning pair of eyes. "Have you two been getting overwhelmed by the work they pile up on your desk?"
Laida nodded. "The Inheritor design is frustrating. Nevermind that it’s a spaceborn mech and that I only specialize in aerial mechs, but the Inheritor is showing its age. There is hardly anything we can improve without drastically overhauling its design."
"So it’s a legacy design?"
"It’s not old to the point to be called a legacy, but it’s design originated from the first half of this current mech generation. We are now late in the cycle and there are several major advancements in currentgen technology that we are missing out on for the Inheritor because the effort required to transform every Inheritor mech in existence is too much."
The Inheritor mechs serve as the workhorse of the Vandals. It was one of their most common mechs, and highlighted their preference for close-ranged combat against other mechs.
"Ves, what do you think about the Inheritor?" Laida asked him in a way that made it hard for him to withhold his answer.
"I don’t know. I’ve never seen the Flagrant Vandals in action besides some incidental battle footage. To me, the Vandals are living at the edge of the moment. It’s true that fielding lots of light mechs is cheap and easy, but that lack of weight will cost them dearly if they are ever forced into a position to fight against a proper Vesian mech regiment. For example, any of the 3rd Imodris Legion’s regiments can smash them into pieces."
"That’s counterbalanced by the fact that they are easier to pilot and excellent in overtaking supply convoys."
This was why the Vandals regarded the Inheritor so highly. The Vandals faced a lot of difficulties in recruiting capable mech pilots. Any recruit with promise would be snapped up by the more desirable regiments. The Vandals mostly received the dregs the service. They couldn’t do much against mech pilots with attitude problems, but those with lack of talent in piloting could still be brought up as cannon fodder inside an Inheritor mech.
Compared to Laida, Pierce faced a very different problem with the Akkara.
"Heavy mechs are different from light mechs. There’s much more leeway in their design. Even though it’s rather old as well, its internal architecture changed so much over the years that I can hardly call it outdated. My team has done well in updating it to the latest standard. The only problem is that our implementations fall short."
"Because there are too many systems inside a heavy mech, am I right?"
"That’s right. My father once taught me that it is a heavy commitment if you wish to embark on designing a heavy mech. The Akkara design is a basket case of incompatibilities. There is hardly any optimisation done because the Wolf Mother’s processors would crash if we threw too many things at it. Heavy mechs should be designed in proper research bases, not aboard a factory ship."
Lack of manpower and computing power slowed down the development of the Akkara design. It was a very unsubtle mech and required brute force to solve many of its problem.
"Is your design team biting off more than they can chew?"
"That’s an understatement!" Pierce huffed. "In my eyes, while the Akkara design fills an important gap in the lineup of the Vandals, we can’t keep up with the complexities of this parade horse."
Ves could have said the same. Though the problems with the Hellcat didn’t sound so extreme as the Akkara, a hybrid knight came with its own bag of issues.
"All three designs developed internally by the Vandals have one thing in common." Ves remarked as he put his mind on them. "They’re products of pride."
"Pride?"
Ves shrugged a bit. "Maybe you can call it stubbornness. If the Flagrant Vandals wanted to, they could have borrowed a ready-made design from the central database. I’m sure the Mech Corps developed a raft of highly-optimised designs of a light skirmisher, a medium hybrid knight and a heavy cannoneer."
"Why stick to the current designs then?"
"Because every mech regiment prides their own identity. Only rarely will a mech regiment borrow a design cooked up by other design teams within the Mech Corps because that would be admitting that they can’t wipe their own butts."
"That’s crazy." Laida murmured as she shook her head. "We’re not like any other mech regiment. Our design team is less than a fifth the size of any other team. We can only cope with developing one design at most."
No matter how much they think the current policy was stupid, none of it could be changed. Ves sighed and sank down into his sesat. "This isn’t the only area where the Vandals are sticking to their guns. These guys have taken self-sufficiency to an unprecedented height for a mech regiment of the Mech Corps. It’s baked into their DNA."
That has served the Vandals well so far, but how long could they go on in the same manner? Eventually, they would hit a wall.
Ever since Ves embarked on the path to become a mech designer, he progressed at a rapid pace. He liked to think he learned to see things others didn’t. Though his place among the Vandals only allowed him to observe a tiny part of their functioning, what he derived from it worried him a lot.
Ves placed his hand against the surface of the bulkhead and felt its cold metallic touch. The Wolf Mother traveled through a succession of star systems. Each time the ship exited FTL, the entire ship underwent a minor upheaval. It spoke much about the haphazard way the Wolf Mother grew to her current form.
Yet despite this side effect, nothing suffered any ill effects. The resourceful crew of the Wolf Mother timed their most critical operations around the schedule of transitions. They made sure that the production lines didn’t work on something delicate whenever the ship entered or dropped out of FTL.
"You’re tougher than you look like."
Much of what made the Vandals survive up to now came down to their ingenuity. They scraped by with a fraction of the resources that a proper mech regiment enjoyed. Though he found their design development plans to be perplexing and the legality of some of their actions a little iffy, he had to admit that the Vandals was the top regiment in the Republic in terms of resourcefulness alone.
Having lived among them and observed them up close made Ves a little sympathetic to their cause. Despite their outward displays of cynicism, they still retained a core of discipline and duty.
With regards to his work, his routine remained the same, though Alloc finally started to notice that Ves finished his work faster than others. Now that he ceased to be preoccupied with tinkering with the software of the Hellcat, Alloc finally spent more time watching over the mech designers working under him. Compared to the other Apprentices, Ves stood out in how relaxed he approached his assignments.
At some time, Alloc pulled Ves aside into a private office.
The Journeyman Mech Designer stared at the younger man with a penetrating stare. "Ves, according to the logs in your terminal, the speed at which you are nailing down the right numbers is a little frightening. It’s so out of bounds that I’ve been testing you with a number of different problems. The way you work with math and physics is frankly frightening for a mech designer of your age. Who are you?"
"I’m Ves Larkinson, no one else. As for how I got to be so good, didn’t you read my record?"
"I’ve seen nominal disciples to Masters in action before. None of them have rocketed upwards as fast as you." Alloc frowned as he tried to crack the secret behind Ves’ ascent. "Though I don’t specialize in Physics, the ease at which you solve complex issues related to this field surpasses what I’m capable of. Are you an alien or something?"
Ves laughed a little. "Sir, though my genes are kind of mixed up right now, I’m still a human in heart and blood. My life experiences are a little different from others."
One thing that Ves was most afraid of was eliciting Alloc’s jealousy. It would be extremely depressing if his direct superior wanted to squash Ves down due to being unable to tolerate someone younger being better than an actual Journeyman.
It appeared that Ves did not have to worry about that account. As much as Alloc enjoyed his own status, the dire state of the 6th Flagrant Vandals and the Hellcat design team had left Alloc in a state where extra talent and manpower should be cherished.
"You’re an anomaly, Ves." Alloc concluded with utmost seriousness. "I can’t quite put my thumb on you. Nothing in your record makes sense.The only way to explain it is if some unknown influence is cultivating you."
Ves could say nothing against that. He couldn’t mention anything about the Mech Designer System and how it had been a massive aid to his mech design career. He would rather let Alloc make his own conclusions.
After some time, Alloc nodded and smacked his fist against his palm. "I understand why the Mech Corps sent someone as promising as you to the Vandals. Unlike headquarters, we don’t care about your allegiances at all. You’re aboard the Wolf Mother just like the rest, so I hardly believe you would do anything that would go against our interests. We are literally on the same boat in that regard."
Though Ves felt a little pissed that Alloc casually questioned his loyalties like that, he was smart enough not to make a fuss about it. This was a critical moment for him. Opening his mouth would just ruin his chances.
"I’ve decided now. Since we’re so short-handed, I’ll let you pick your own assignments. I’ll increase your privileges so that you can access the planning and the list of issues for the Hellcat design. I don’t have the authority to unlock the entire design schematics to you, but you should have plenty to do with the access you already have."
"Thank you, sir! You won’t regret your decision!"
"You better not slack off, Ves. The Flagrant Vandals has already joined the main fleet, and we have already crossed the borders. While I can’t predict how much time it takes to reach the Imodris Duchy, try to present some solid results within a month. Any longer and we won’t have the time to implement any improvements you’ve made to our existing Hellcats."
Ves promised to respect the confidentiality of the information made available to him. Satisfied, Alloc delivered on his promise and raised the amount of files Ves could access.
Among the miscellaneous documents that Alloc unlocked for Ves, the most important piece of information was the succinct list of issues and problems facing the Hellcat.
They consisted of observations made by the mech pilots that handled the Hellcats and the problems foreseen by the mech designers themselves. All of the problems amounted to a very long list, though most seemed rather trivial.
Still, for a perfectionist like Ves, he became dismayed when he finally realized the extent of the imperfections.
"This is only the tip of the iceberg."
Many more problems wracked the Hellcat design. They just hadn’t been observed yet.
"Let’s forget about the problems out of sight. The visible ones alone are more than enough to keep me busy for years."
Alloc took a chance in increasing the privileges enjoyed by Ves, but unspoken in that move was that his superior expected more things. Ves needed to prove his chops and repay Alloc’s trust.
Not everyone responded well to his increase in responsibilities. Something like this couldn’t be hidden from the other Apprentices.
"Sir! I protest! Mr. Larkinson is just a temp! He’s the last person among us who should be handling all of that sensitive information!"
Alloc happened to have a very effective response to that argument. "Tell that to me once you can outsmart Mr. Larkinson."
No one dared to make that claim. In the previous weeks, Ves painstakingly demonstrated his competence, which much have surely damaged their confidence. Though he was an outsider who only joined the Hellcat design team due to the war, his presence had already improved their efficiency.
Though the Apprentices didn’t look resigned, they could only keep their opinions to themselves. They stared enviously as Ves browsed the expanded database in a leisurely manner.
"What shall I tackle?"
Ves had no time to pay attention to everyone else’s stares. Alloc expected great results from him, so Ves needed to pick something impactful that fell within his capabilities to solve. Not a lot of problems met this criteria.
He flicked through each and every problem on the list. Even if he rejected most of them, it was still valuable for him to read this list. "Hmmm... software again, not my cup of tea. Increasing the actuation speed of the legs, sounds more interesting, but that’s hardly consequential for a spaceborn mech.
"Enhancing the power of the wrist-mounted nail drivers... that sounds interesting."
The nail drivers served a small purpose to the Hellcat design, perhaps too small. Due to weight and space constraints, the nail driver only accommodated four nails in total. This was highly limiting and only really gave the Hellcat an extra lifeline in certain situations.
"Can I increase the power of the nail driver or overhaul its internal mechanisms?"
He already thought of a couple of tweaks, but a bigger solution remained elusive. Professor Velten must have gone over this problem plenty of times and this time was no different. The nail drivers enjoyed her personal attention for a time and she optimized the nail drivers to the point where she couldn’t come up with more gains.
As Ves studied the schematics of the nail driver and some other components, he also perceived the flavor of Professor Velten’s design philosophy.
It felt a bit strange.
Since the Hellcat was a collaborative project, the purity of its design was rather muddled. Still, Professor Velten’s imprint stood head and shoulders above everyone elese’s, including the minor work that Ves imparted on the design up to now.
"Ves found it difficult to describe Professor Velten’s design philosophy. "Perpetuance? No. "timelessness, enduring, fading."
One of the hidden dangers in the Hellcat design was that Ves faintly sensed some weaknesses seeping into the heart of its design. For some reason, Professor Velten started to lose her love for the design.
Ves couldn’t blame her. The Hellcat’s numerous demands tore it apart. It needed to fly, use up three weapon systems at once and it needed to be well-protected as well. It was enough to hear his heart out!
Though he didn’t think well of the Hellcat, the way the Vandals made the most out of the design made Ves realize that not all mechs had to be technical masterpieces.
"A good mech isn’t necessarily the one with the best specs or the strongest X-Factor. The best mech is the machine that gets the job done.
In this regard, the Hellcat made a definite impression on the enemy. Therefore, Ves found it regretful that Professor Velten started to slide.
"I can’t let this downward trend go on. Whatever is going on with Professor Velten, she can’t leave her own work in the dust like this. It deserves more."
In choosing where to start first, Ves no longer relied on the data included in the reports. Instead, he closed his eyes and started to commune with the design on a spiritual level.
It was hard, incredibly hard. In order to understand the nucleus of this mech, Ves needed to cut through all of the interference. Too many people used to work on this design. Their mixed sentiments polluted the design and made it harder for Ves to get a read on the design.
Ves continually refined his methods, but they only amounted to a limited amount of improvement.
What Ves got out of the Hellcat design was decidedly mixed. He perceived conflicting emotions from two unknown designers that nonetheless left a huge mark on the design.
"Seems like Professor Velten hadn’t designed this mech after all. She inherited from other Seniors."
The imprints of those two echoes were so strong and distinct that they couldn’t be anything else but Senior Mech Designers. Though Ves couldn’t get a solid read on the design itself, Ves figured he could infer some of its core traits by interpreting the imprints from the Seniors.
This was a very fascinating experience, and despite appearing like a lazy idiot in the presence of the other mech designers, Ves cheerfully plunged into the depths of the two distinct flavors.
"Interesting!"
Much of the issues surrounding the Hellcat design could be traced back to its original designers. They possessed very distinct outlooks and wanted to pull the Hellcat into two seperate directions.
One designer favored defense, and possessed a lot of experience in designing knights. The other designer emphasized versatility, and must have possessed a substantial amount of experience in designing hybrid and multipurpose mechs.
Both of them somehow ended up working on the same project, and from the looks of it, neither of them possessed authority over the other. They had been forced to cooperate on equal terms.
"What a tragedy."
Whoever ordered them to do so didn’t know anything about mech design. With no obvious lead designer in charge of the project, the Hellcat grew in scope and its featured ballooned to its present bloated state. Though they did a remarkable job in slimming down its internals, the interconnectedness of it all hadn’t aged the Hellcat very well.
"It’s a design that’s difficult to update."
As a spaceborn hybrid mech design, the Hellcat had been stretched into two opposite directions right at the onset of its conception. In the eyes of someone like Ves, he would argue that the Hellcat lacked a unifying vision that could have guided the design to better straits.
"It’s as if two stubborn kids wanted to play with the same doll and stretched it out between them as they tried to claim sole ownership over the toy."
The consequences to this could be imagined. The Hellcat, with its incongruous tiger head and substantially armored build looked like a cross between two very different mechs. The addition of the nail drivers and the missile launchers seemed more like gimmicks tacked on as an afterthought rather than a mainstay that the mech could rely on to save the day.
"At least the Caesar Augustus can rely on its miniature laser cannons to take out targets just out of range of its sword."
The Caesar Augustus was a much more inferior mech in terms of specs and scope, but the mere fact that it had been designed by a single mech designer who knew what he wanted made it a more coherent design.
Compared to the first work of an Apprentice Mech Designer, the Hellcat incorporated many advanced techniques and applications. Even after studying the additional documents made available to him, Ves hardly understood how the original designers managed to stuff so much capabilities in so little space.
Nevertheless, the current foibles with the Hellcat design underscored that technical prowess couldn’t compensate for a lack of vision.
"It’s not that it can’t be done, but this is just a case where the original designers didn’t leave any leeway for the future."
Ves found it sad that such a promising design had been born with what effectively amounted to a deformity. It didn’t became very evident at birth, but as it grew older, the design started to crack and show its weaknesses.
Therefore, the responsibilities piled up on the shoulders of the Hellcat design team was too much for them to cope. Even Ves couldn’t steer away a ship that was determined to travel right into a sun.
Sadly, even if Alloc and Professor Velten were aware of this critical fault, they couldn’t convince the Vandals to replace their prestige mechs with a different design. Organizational inertia meant that the design team needed to stick with this creaking product no matter how much it fell apart.
"How depressing."
This important realization put his role into perspective. He shouldn’t attempt to do anything too ambitious. With his current level of skill, he had no chance in revamping the design to a healthy state.
The best he could describe its situation was that the longevity of the design was running out. Rather than extending its useful lifetime, Ves could only improve some minor performance parameters in order to let the Hellcat make the most out of its final years of active use.
Ves had no doubt that the Vandals would eventually be forced to drop the Hellcat design during this war. The Vesian mech designers faced a lot of pressure in improving their own designs, and if the Hellcat failed to keep up, its end would come sooner or later.
"That’s something that will happen at least a year from now on. For now, the Hellcat is still a viable mech."
He returned to the list of problems and decided to tackle an issue that was challenging but one he could also complete within a month. It concerned a very persistent problem regarding the energy efficiency of the mech.
The Hellcat’s high performance metrics and ability to make an immediate impact on the battlefield came at a cost. The power draw was enormous and the heat that it built up was very problematic for a mech in space.
When the design originally came into being, the original designers already mitigated these issues. However, as the years passed and the design kept being tweaked to keep up with the current times, the old optimisations in terms of power draw and heat dispersal ceased to work as effectively. The design had strayed too much from its old lines, and the introduction of new components complicated the internal architecture in ways that made it much less efficient.
It all sounded boring to a bystander, but the veteran mech pilots that have piloted the Hellcat for years became increasingly frustrated at this downward trend.
The report on the problem came with a quote from a very pissed off mech pilot.
"Why is it that the Hellcat keeps getting worse? I don’t care about faster flight systems and more lethal nail drivers! I just want a mech that can last an entire fight! Hell, it won’t even last a short skirmish sometimes. Fix this issue immediately or roll back the design to an older version!"
The problem had obviously brewed for an extended period of time. The Hellcat design team should have been more responsive on this issue, but for some reason they kept on holding to the same course.
In all honesty, solving this issue required a multi-disciplinary approach. Ves wasn’t sure if he possessed the right breadth and depth of skills to be able to provide a solution to this problem. After all, neither Alloc nor Professor Velten had done anything about it, though that might be because they had bigger things in mind.
"In any case, this is a useful starting point to prove my worth. It’s a very legitimate problem that needs solving anyhow."
Ves began to dive into his work by investigation the evolution of the design in recent years. He wanted to trace back the changes to specific changes in the design so he could come up with localized solutions.
All of this was boring and tedious, but Ves never lost his motivation. Several weeks went by in a fog as Ves single-mindedly focused on this sole issue alone. He made a substantial amount of progress, but the sheer amount of changes left him a little fatigued. It was too much work to establish the consequences of every single change to the design.
To be honest, he was being stymied by the sheer level of interconnectedness of the design. His inability to understand the Hellcat down to its roots also didn’t help. There was a level of depth and complexity to each of its shapes.
Ves felt like he was toddler looking at a painting and ruining it by dabbling his fingers through paint and raking them across the canvas. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, his solutions only made things worse.
Still, at least he made some progress, however sluggish it turned out to be. Any progress was better than no progress at all, but it defied the high hopes he had started with. Ves grossly underestimated the actual challenge of reshaping an already completed design at the Senior level.
"My progress is too slow." Ves muttered as he furrowed his brows. Several weeks into his task, and he only completed a fourth of what he should have accomplished.
A lack of understanding lay at the heart of his inability to progress. He couldn’t do much to advance his understanding of the higher-level concepts that made Journeyman and Senior Mech Designers unique. Short of breaking through himself, Ves would have to accept that his perspective would be limited for the time being.
He could still advance his understanding in a different direction, something which he already did quite well.
Therefore, one day, Ves put down his work and marched up to Alloc. "Sir?"
"What is it, Ves?"
"I’d like to request an opportunity to witness the Hellcat in action. I’ve spent a substantial amount of time with its design, but I still only have a vague idea of how this mech is supposed to perform in action."
Alloc frowned and turned away from his work. "A mech designer is supposed to be content with the design schematics alone. There shouldn’t be any need to see a real Hellcat."
"Respectfully, that’s not the way I work. The best I can describe it is that I design my mechs from feeling. Without a feel for a design, I can’t work with it as well as I ought to. The Hellcat is at least ten times more complex than anything I’ve ever worked on before, so it is even more vital for me to get a handle on the mech action."
"I’m not inclined to grant your request. I’m under orders to keep temps like you in one place. It’s going to take a lot of effort to convince Professor Velten to grant an exception for you."
Ves already expected something like this, so he provided an immediate response to that argument. Ves waved his hand, causing his comm to transfer his work up to now. "Look at what I’ve accomplished. This is only a fraction of what I am able to do."
Curious, Alloc turned to his terminal and studied some of the solutions that Ves came up with. They weren’t anything groundbreaking, nor did they improve the performance of the Hellcat by a substantial amount. Nevertheless, it was already impressive for an Apprentice Mech Designer to lessen the problem of excessive power draw by a fraction of a percentage point without negatively affecting anything else.
"Hm." The Journeyman quickly processed the solutions Ves came up with. "These solutions don’t seem half-bad. We’ll need to perform a lot more simulations in order to verify their soundness, but you have made a substantial contribution to our design team."
Ves sensed a caveat there.
"This does not mean that I can allow you to run off to the mech pilots and pester them to show off their Hellcats to you. You have to realize that there is a time and place for things. We do not allow anyone to come into contact with a Vandal."
In the end, Ves did not receive approval and had to go back empty-handed. Why didn’t Alloc grant his seemingly reasonable request?
One possible explanation stood out.
"There must be something going on that can’t be leaked."
Ves thought back on what the recent announcements were about. The Colonel Lowenfield intended to sneak the 6th Flagrant Vandals all the way to the Imodris Duchy from the border.
This was a daunting task for any mech regiment that hailed from the Kingdom’s mortal enemy. The only way the Vandals could get this far without detection was if they enlisted the help of the local rebels.
"Have the Vesian rebels already rendezvoused with the fleet?"
The idea was frightening, but sounded very real. Perhaps the Vesian Revolutionary Front hadn’t come with a handful of emissaries, but brought a couple of carriers and mechs along for the ride as well.
This basically meant that a mech regiment of the Republic willingly joined hands with an element of the Vesia Kingdom!
It did not matter if the Vandals struck a deal with the rebels, the mere fact that they owed their allegiance to Vesia, if not for the Kingdom, was a huge affront if news ever leaked!
"Why would the Vesian rebels accompany the Vandals with their own war assets?"
It didn’t make any sense. The 6th Flagrant Vandals might not be very impressive compared to the rest of the Mech Corps, but it was a proper mech regiment at its core.
Ves tried to wrack his brains but couldn’t come up with any satisfactory explanation except for one.
"What if they lied to us?"
This was a very serious accusation to make, and a tenuous one as well since Ves based this conclusion off a series of very wild conjectures. Still, it reinforced his impression that something shady was going on with the Vandals right now. Perhaps their presumed mission of penetrating deep into Vesian space in order to raid their industrial planet wasn’t so simple after all.
"All of this is wild talk without evidence."
Without confirmations, his ideas remained ideas. Although he had a very overactive imagination, sometimes the truth often turned out to be simpler than he suspected.
Still, Ves wasn’t comfortable with staying put. If nothing else, he had a duty to follow the leads and see where he ended up. "There’s too much at stake. I can’t afford to be negligent."
Ever since he started questioning the motives of the 6th Flagrant Vandals, Ves regarded his posting in a different light. The undercurrent of discontent and the general apathy towards the Mech Corps may not be confined to the lower ranks. What if the underlings merely reflected the honest attitudes of their superiors?
Sitting behind his terminal, Ves turned around his head and regarded Alloc and the Apprentices in a different light. Besides the temp sent from the Rittersberg region, the others all had a couple years of service under their belt.
Curiously, not many mech designers in the design department of the Vandals stuck around for more than half a decade or so. Alloc happened to be one of the few exceptions due to being mentored by Professor Velten. Everyone else seemed to have been sent to the Vandals as punishment or exile.
Could he talk to them about his concerns?
"No."
Ves did not kid himself that he could find a place aboard the Wolf Mother without any form of monitoring. Having left his personal comm with the Privacy Shield behind on Cloudy Curtain, he no longer possessed any means of blocking any electronic ears and eyes pointed in his direction.
"Besides, where do their loyalties lie?"
Not every mech designer entered the private sector and started a business to sell their own mechs. Some wanted an easier path in life, so they applied to established mech manufacturers or design studios to exercise their craft.
Naturally, only those with promise received the best job offerings where they could actually be involved in the design of a mech. Average mech designers stood no chance in obtaining an important position, and would always devolve in a glorified technicians.
In fact, a large number of chief technicians graduated with a degree in mech design, only to be relegated to a job in the mech stables or mech workshops.
The same pattern persisted in the military. The Mech Corps relied on many different mech designs, and they needed a huge number of mech designers to keep their mechs fresh and up to date.
Working in the Mech Corps formed a particularly attractive prospect to most mech designers. They pay was bad, but the benefits were good and every mech designer assigned to a design team received varying levels of access to the central database, which not only contained lots of designs and exclusive technologies, but also contained a library of very valuable textbooks.
All of this made working for the Mech Corps a good starting point for any mech designer that lacked the confidence to dive into the cutthroat competitive private sector. Once they served for twenty years or more and retired from the service, they would be in a much better position to enter the market.
"Since the mech designers in the service value their time here so much, why don’t I see any older ones?"
While the Apprentice Mech Designers aboard the Wolf Mother varied in age, they tended to be in their thirties or younger. What Ves really paid attention to was that none of them had been in the design department for long.
"Where are all the veteran designers?"
Had they been transferred out or cashiered, or did something else happen to them? Ves tried to approach the topic in an oblique manner when he conversed with some of the Apprentices during mealtime.
"Say, our teams are awfully short-handed." He said in a casual manner as he ate his soup next to a colleague. "Why aren’t the higher ups increasing their effort at expanding our teams?"
The tired man munched on a meatpie for a bit before he answered. "No one wants to come and work for the Vandals. We’re the refuse pit of the Vandals. You don’t volunteer to work for us, you get sent here. And while the Mech Corps loves to dump all their problem cases in our laps, they’ll be accused of committing war crimes if they did that to every mech designer they don’t like."
They both chuckled a bit at that.
"It’s not so bad here. Sure, the Vandals are a little shabbier than most, but we still have plenty of room in our three design teams. My question is why are we so chronically undermanned? This isn’t a new phenomenon."
"I don’t know what to say." The other mech designer shrugged, though he seemed a little more reticent this time. "There used to be some mech designers in our team that are senior to me. They served for a couple of years but their exhaustion continued to grow. They would have collapsed sooner or later."
"Did they?"
"Professor Velten approached them before they got to that point. The professor offered to transfer them to a new, exciting and secret design team far away from the Wolf Mother. I don’t know all the details, but from what I’ve seen from the faces of the mech designers who accepted, they all looked ecstatic."
"Did every mech designer accept the transfer?"
"Yup. You’d be a fool not to. While I appreciate the chance to contribute to the Hellcat design, it will ruin you if you try to work with it for more than a handful of years. There’s something very corrosive about this design that grates at your sanity. I don’t know how to describe it. All I know is that I’m already feeling that my limit is within sight."
This sounded very strange to Ves. He put down his spoon and faced his colleague with open eyes. "Why is the Hellcat design so damaging?"
"I asked Alloc one day, and he said that the Hellcat is a design that incorporates transcendent concepts that only Journeyman Mech Designers and higher could handle. It’s always said that Apprentices aren’t mature in the field of mech design, and I guess this is one of the most important reasons why."
Ves believed this statement. It explained much of how the mech industry worked. He only heard an inkling about it during his studies, probably so that the professors could shield them from the truth, but it might indeed be the case that advanced designs possessed such an effect.
He even figured that it might be related to the intangible qualities of a mech, but that shouldn’t be it. Ves did not perceive anything damaging during his own investigation of the Hellcat.
It was likely the other mech designer was right, and that it was a case of overstraining the mind when dealing with concepts beyond the means of understanding. There were plenty of secrets hidden in plain sight, and Ves might eventually go crazy as well if he dove too deep in the design nuances of the Hellcat.
After Ves finished his dinner, he left on his own accord. For the next several days, he broached the same topic to a couple of other mech designers. Ves wasn’t close with any of them so didn’t receive any good answers, but he figured that they believed that nothing sinister was at play.
The key takeaway from his questioning was that the story he heard possessed an element of truth. Mech designers indeed needed to get away from a design that was slowly driving them insane.
What Ves wanted to know was where they went. As far as Ves was aware of, the 6th Flagrant Vandals did not maintain a separate group of mech designers. So where did those people work? Was it another mech regiment, or something shadier?
Ves ended up with more questions than answers, but he did not believe he achieved a fruitless result. While he couldn’t follow up on his detail, he believed that it might be very important down the line.
"That still begs the question that I haven’t been able to answer."
He came no closer to finding out what the Vandals planned to do. This frustrated him to no end, which slowed him down when he was on duty. He wasn’t in the mood to improve the power efficiency of the Hellcat when all he could think about was whether the Vandals committed treason.
There was a difference between breaking some rules and committing outright treason. His initials impressions of the Vandals painted a picture of a tragic and neglected mech regiment. Now though, Ves wondered if the Mech Corps might have a good reason to keep the Vandals at arm’s length.
"The Mech Corps isn’t in the habit of fooling around unless it concerns internal rivalry."
It was obvious that the Flagrant Vandals fell outside of the dominant factions in the Mech Corps. They stood on their own and had no one powerful to back them up. Even their own division pushed them aside.
It couldn’t be helped if the Vandals became disillusioned at being kept on a leash. The only problem was that every mech designer was confined to a small part of the massive factory ship. Besides those who liaised with the mech pilots and mech designers, no one had gotten a glimpse of what happened at the heart of the Vandals.
Ves supposed that he could have tried to pry some information from Alloc and Professor Velten, but he didn’t dare pull off any tricks in their presence. Both were not only busy, but they could also be remarkably perceptive if they directed their full attention to him. The only saving grace was that they prioritized their own work over looking over the shoulders of their subordinates.
"Am I in a dead end?"
He was unwilling to let his inquiry end so soon without grasping even a hint of the truth. Though everything seemed fine and nothing might be wrong, he would never feel at ease among the Vandals as long as his questions remained unanswered.
"I need an opportunity."
So far, he failed to receive any dispensations from Alloc, but Ves did not intend to give up now. Perhaps he needed to work a little longer in order to appear dependable enough to be sent on liaison assignments.
For now, the key was to excel in his work. After squaring away his doubts and uncertainties, Ves dove back into his work. This time, his results improved, and Ves managed to optimize the Hellcat design in a marginally better way.
Just before the start of Professor Velten’s next conference, Ves handed over the final set of solutions to Alloc. They were less dramatic than he hoped, but all of his solutions should be sound.
Alloc only briefly skimmed through his work. "I’ll take them up to the Professor the next time I see her, but you did a good job."
"Thank you, sir. I was hoping for better, though."
The Journeyman released a cynical smile. "We all do, but the Hellcat does everything in its way to thwart our efforts."
In the end, Ves grudgingly received Alloc’s approval to continue working on his own pace. This was important to Ves because he would be able to continue to pick out the best assignments.
At the next conference meeting, a routine of sorts had already settled. The Professor made some inconsequential announcements while the Journeyman walked to the front to mention their latest excuses why they hadn’t made any better progress.
Professor Velten appeared to be paying serious attention, but Ves questioned whether her mind was even present. Sometimes the old lady doddored off.
After the conference, Professor Velten suddenly turned around and called up Ves. "Mr. Larkinson! Please come with me!"
For a moment, Ves thought he had been caught. Yet no one really paid any attention to the call besides Laida and Pierce. With some reluctance, Ves filed into the Professor’s private office and sat down in front of the Senior Mech Designer.
She immediately broached the topic as soon as he sat down. "It has come to my attention that you are a relatively successful mech designer."
Why did she ask him that?
"Success is a difficult term to quantify, but arguably yes, I do believe I have done well."
"When your records first came into my view, I did not think much of your prior experience. An Apprentice with only two original designs under his belt is barely a genuine mech designer. So it is a surprise for me to hear that you are one of the primary mech designers of a design that’s been all the rage in the market right now."
"Huh? Ah, what I mean is, which design is selling well?"
"The Crystal Lord, your landbound rifleman mech design."
Ever since Ves entered the clutches of the Mech Corps, he became isolated to the outside galaxy. In an age where spying and leaking sensitive data was trivially easy, the military organization undertook extreme measures in order to keep their rank and file from revealing anything they shouldn’t have.
While the Flagrant Vandals might not see eye-to-eye with the upper hierarchy, they happened to be in total agreement with regards to operational security.
As a mech regiment that regularly invaded Vesian space, any incautious leaks might even devastate their numbers. Therefore, access points to the outside galaxy was extremely limited and heavily monitored. The moment Ves revealed a hint of propriety, his entire terminal would shut off.
Thus, over the past couple of months, Ves had no idea how the LMC fared in his absence. In truth, he didn’t really worry about their fate. The company was in decent hands and it offered two solid original designs in its catalog.
The Blackbeak medium knight already proved to be an enduring seller. Even if the market for offensive knights started to become somewhat saturated, demand for the LMC’s homebuilt silver label editions was projected to remained high for at least a couple more years.
Ves was much less certain about the newly-introduced Crystal Lord design. Though it carried over much of the qualities of the Blackbeak, the different type and the range of improvements he incorporated in the design made it an unquestionably more promising mech.
The Blackbeak was meant to compete in a niche, while the Crystal Lord had been designed to challenge the dominant mainstream mechs that was responsible for the bulk of of the sales for rifleman mechs.
It had a lot of things going for it. The premium licenses and materials allowed it to outperform cheaper models and Ves had Superpublished the design on top of that. Its current performance parameters fit well in a multi-year conflict with the Vesians.
More crucially, the Crystal Lord was the first design that broke into the coveted B-grade for the X-Factor. While Ves did not truly understand what this new height of X-Factor meant, he bet that the mech pilots who got to pilot a Crystal Lord must be feeling very privileged about piloting such a smooth machine.
Lastly, the Crystal Lord also incorporated some gimmicks based off alien crystal technology. Though it was hardly anything groundbreaking compared to the heights that humanity had reached, crystal technology like this was rare in a backwater state like the Bright Republic. It should perform particularly well against mechs that predominantly relied on lasers.
All in all, the Crystal Lord possessed all of the elements to be a breakout success.
Yet even as Ves had high hopes for his second original design, the mech market for rifleman mechs was extremely competitive. Realistically, all three labels of the Crystal Lord should have priced themselves out of consideration for most potential buyers.
Therefore, it came at a surprise to him that Professor Velten indicated otherwise.
"May I know how well my Crystal Lord design is doing?"
Though Ves faced heavy restrictions in terms of how much information he could get in touch with, the Senior Mech Designer faced no such constraints. She easy answered his question.
"The Crystal Lord has been something of an anomaly when you first released it onto the market. They didn’t know what to make of it, and sales have stayed modest for the first month. Expert opinions about your design is decidedly mixed, with many of them recommending their audience to stay away."
To an outside pundit who had never seen a Crystal Lord in person, its value proposition seemed like a bad deal. Rather than break the bank by buying a single overpriced rifleman mech, it was much more efficient to buy two affordable rifleman mechs for the same amount of credits.
"What changed since then, professor?"
She eyed him with a curious look. "The early adopters of your models discovered two advantages that aren’t present in many other mechs. First, your gimmick is a lot more useful than anyone has thought. Wielding a lighter laser rifle and possessing more advanced defenses against energy weapons on the chest helps keep the mechs alive during the most intensive engagements."
"The Crystal Lord has seen action?"
"Vesian raids have intensified. They have likely been emboldened by the daring raids of the 3rd Imodris Legion. The pressure we are facing back at the home front is immense. Mercenaries are forced to repel small raiding parties that have sneaked through the gaps in our defense lines."
Though Ves paid the most attention to the Crystal Mech, he couldn’t help but feel a little reassured from the way Professor Velten spoke about Republic space. At least outwardly, she still displayed kinship with their state.
"The Mech Legion fields a substantial number of mechs armed with laser weapons. Against these mechs, your Crystal Lord has stood out as the mech with one of the highest rates of survival. Normal rifleman mechs regularly get trashed, that’s why they are so cheap. Yours is a little more effective than usual into keeping it and its pilot alive, and that ends up amounting to a substantial amount of cost savings."
Ves nodded in a modest manner. "That is also my intention, ma’am. The Crystal Lord is supposed to be a long-term investment. Its true value will manifest over the years. You mentioned a second reason for the surging demand for my mech. Can you tell me what it is?"
Her eyes grew a little sharper at that, and she tried to peer into his soul through his eyes. Ves carefully maintained his posture and met her gaze with a neutral look.
"Every mech pilot that has ever piloted a copy of the Crystal Lord has turned into its raving fans. It has garnered a die-hard following that is continuing to grow the more people get in touch with it, no matter the shape it comes in. Bronze label, silver label, gold label, every edition of your mech exhibit the same concerning trend. Even the virtual copies of the Crystal Lord is distressingly effective in converting people into your fans."
It should have been good news for Ves, but instead he started to sweat inside. Had he overdone it? During the early testing, the X-Factor never exhibited such radical effects on a mech pilot’s psyche. "Are people accusing me of brainwashing my pilots?"
Fortunately, Velten shook her head. "This is not a repeat of the Farund Affair, if that is what you are worried about. Even though the pundits can say whatever they want, the truth is that the Mech Trade Association validated your design. This carries a lot of weight among us. To be sure that your company and its partners haven’t been producing mechs that deviated from the official design, the MTA has dispatched some investigators and inspected their premises. All of the companies involved have been cleared."
Ves knew that he was innocent, but the MTA didn’t know that. They needed to verify his company’s products and their operations on their own in order to determine the facts.
"I take it no one believes my company has tampered with the neural interfaces?"
"Yes. The controversy has died down after several critics have attempted to dismantle the neural interfaces. In hindsight, their exuberance can be attributed to how extensively you’ve met their demands. You possess an extremely keen understanding of what mech pilots seek from their machines."
Was Professor Velten probing him whether he benefited from a Mastery?
Ves instinctively moved to deny the implicit suspicion, but quickly hesitated.
The reason why he would want to keep it under wraps because he wouldn’t be able to explain how he got to enjoy this exclusive privilege that Master Mech Designers only reserved for their prized direct disciples. As someone who fell outside that coveted category, Ves shouldn’t have received so much nurturing.
Yet did that matter if Professor Velten very likely wouldn’t find out the truth? Mastery was a sensitive topic at best, and those who experienced it already showed its benefits through their work. Velten had no reason to follow up because she could already access his top level design schematics from the MTA and see for herself.
His response to this situation was critically important and might govern the rest of his stay with the Vandals. There was a risk that the truth might leak out that he gained his Masteries through a more dubious source. Yet Ves deemed the risk to be acceptable in the face of what was at stake.
His investigation into the truth of the Vandals had come to a screeching halt due to the restrictions he faced. This was a chance for him to loosen some of those restrictions and grant him wider access to the secretive mech regiment.
"This is supposed to be a secret, but my designs are benefiting from the fact that I have gained two Masteries, one for knight mechs and one for rifleman mechs."
Velten did not respond with any surprise. Instead, she raised a single eyebrow. "How curious. If the Mech Corps knew what kind of mech designer you are, they would have never pushed you into our hands."
"It’s not something I wish to advertise."
She grinned. "Indeed. Well, one mech regiment’s misfortune is another blessing to the Flagrant Vandals. You’ve demonstrated through your work in the private sector that you deeply understand the demands of those we serve, the mech pilots who bravely pilot their mechs into the most dangerous situations imaginable. Out of all three of the design teams under my wing, no mech designer can say they have acquired a Mastery. Not even I have enjoyed such a privilege..."
Velten sounded somewhat regretful about that. Ves felt it was a shame as well. At her age, her design philosophy had already taken shape. She missed out on a lot during her formative years. As talented as she was back in her youth, if she acquired some Masteries at that early stage, her career would have skyrocketed, and there was a very real chance that she could have advanced to Master.
"What do you have in mind for me, professor?"
"Mr. Larkinson, I see now that your talents are grossly underutilized. The success of your Crystal Lord is the strongest proof of your abilities. Did you know that your company has shook hands with over five third-party manufacturers, and they still can’t keep up with demand?"
Hearing that almost frightened Ves out of his chair. What was Calsie doing?! Didn’t he tell her to pick her partners carefully? Going in bed with five different mech manufacturers so soon was too fast! How would the LMC be able to control the quality of their output?
"I did not know that. I feel rather troubled, actually."
"Plans change. I can’t tell you much about this, but I believe your company is on the right track. That is all you should know. The Mech Corps maintains a policy of isolating its mech designers from the news of their own companies. You are working for us, not the market."
"I understand." Ves nodded. That made a lot of sense.
"In light of your newly unearthed strengths and your diligent work ethic you’ve shown up to this point, I plan to elevate your position under this department in order to best take advantage of your unique talents."
"What will my new position entail?"
"You are to be appointed as our permanent liaison to the mech pilots that utilize our homegrown designs. As someone who knows mech pilots the best, you are eminently suitable to understand their specific wishes and convey them to our design teams. Take the rest of the day off. You’ll start on your new assignment tomorrow."
"Thank you, professor!"
This was exactly what he wanted to hear! Though the manner in which he gained this assignment was a little strange, he nonetheless escaped the cage the Vandals set among most of its mech designers.
Staying in this cage for months on end seemed like torture to Ves. Though he loved to design mechs as any other designer in the teams, he would have gone crazy if he worked with numbers and figures all day.
Ves was a very hands-on designer. Without seeing a mech in the flesh, he would never be able to understand it as deeply as he wanted to. Now, he finally got the chance to see what the Vandals were really like, starting with the mech pilots that formed the core of the regiment.
The Bright Republic truly transitioned into a war footing by now. Spending on consumer goods decreased while spending on all things related to war ballooned. Prices of basic goods already started to rise as everyone started to stock up on basic goods.
Food, water, weapons and more began to be sold at greater quantities. This came at the cost of luxury goods, whose manufacturers found it increasingly difficult to convince the citizens to spend their money lavishly.
"Will luxury be able to feed me when our planet is blockaded? Will the most fashionable pair of shoes around be able to defend my children if the Vesians want to take them away?"
Most of the newer companies started to go bust while the older, more conservative companies endured. They had gone through this rodeo many times before, and squirreled away lots of liquidity and resources beforehand. This largely mitigated the economic impact on the Bright Republic’s economy, though a downturn in activity was inevitable.
Although the Republic did not suffer a lot of material damage in the opening stages of the war, the damage to morale was more significant. Public confidence had taken a large nosedive ever since the 3rd Imodris Legion stomped their boots all over of the Bentheim region.
While the aggressive Vesians didn’t have the guts to attack a stronghold, their strategy of attacking many lightly-defended targets succeeded in harming the spirit of the citizens who lived on those same rural planets.
That the Mech Corps never caught up to Lady Amalia’s legion before it successfully returned to Vesian space really struck as a blow to the Mech Corps. The will of the people was a very ephemeral entity. It could swing up and down depending on the most notable events.
Right now, everyone went about their lives with their heads bent a little down. Ever since the war broke out, the Vesians had marched through tons of border systems. While the Mech Corps achieved some victories here and there, the larger trend made the Vesians seem as if they were on fire.
The veterans and the elderly knew that this wasn’t anything unusual. The Mech Corps purposely drew back their lines and consolidated their defenses. Their counterattack would come sooner or later after the Mech Legion ran out of steam. The Vesians always had a tendency to overextend.
"You ain’t seen nothing yet, son. The Vesian bastards don’t move as one. Their nobles are a bunch of jackals who only think for themselves. Just you wait. They’ll split up eventually."
In the meantime, many planets increased their defenses and started to recruit more militia from the populace, even if they didn’t possess the right aptitude to pilot mechs.
Though it was a generally accepted fact that a non-mech force would never be able to defeat a force of mechs, norms still played a vitally important role in many areas. Besides acting in a support capacity, regular humans also fought as infantry or in manned vehicles such as tanks and aircraft.
After all, a mech force was good at destroying things, but they weren’t too suitable in occupying conquered planets and couldn’t reach everywhere.
Infantry, tanks and aircraft might not play the main role, but they provided an effective form of support to any mech force.
However, recruitment was heavily stymied by the fact that it wasn’t very popular to join these branches of service. Pretty much every action drama that have been broadcast in the last four-hundred years depicted them as easily-beaten foils to any enemy mechs that wandered along.
If the citizens wouldn’t volunteer, then the state just had to push them along. Already, several waves of conscription swept the populace. They mostly picked up the unemployed youth and young adults who had been laid off when the companies they worked at shuttered their doors or downsized their operations due to the difficult economic conditions.
This further depressed the general mood in the Republic and made it seem awfully empty at times.
On Cloudy Curtain, Calsie watched over the premises of the Mech Nursery. The white-faced office structures blended harmoniously with the trees planted in their midst. They also neatly hid the ugly forms of Sanyal-Ablin’s defensive turrets.
She looked a far cry from the college graduate from before. She underwent a minor makeover that made her appear more mature, though the wisps of youth was still present under her makeup. She wore a white power suit that mentally stiffened her spine. She sorely needed all the help she could get in order to browbeat the different interest groups involved with the LMC to comply with her directives.
Somehow, she managed. Running a company as its temporary boss wasn’t easy, but she enjoyed plenty of help.
Under her tentative leadership, the company largely followed the same trend as before. The Living Mech Corporation had just expanded its number of production lines from three to five. This allowed the company to produce the silver label Blackbeaks and Crystal Lords without excessively neglecting either of the two highly sought after mech models.
The doors to the penthouse office suddenly opened, allowing Melkor to enter the expansive space. The maturing Larkinson was the only other person besides Calsie who possessed unfettered access to the office that used to be occupied by Ves.
"How is the training coming along, commander?"
"The ’rookies’ we’ve recruited have are starting to show signs of advanced coordination, ma’am. They’ve always been ready for battle, since we only signed up experienced mech pilots, but it’s hard work to get them to unlearn their previous routines and get them to adopt our own."
"Will the Avatars of Myth be able to repel a company of the 5th Vavulan Chasseurs if they come again?"
"Not quite, ma’am. The Chasseurs are a battle-hardened mech pilots with centuries of tradition to guide them. They aren’t pushovers and they won’t be cowed by the current state of my men. It will take years of training to get to that point. The only edge we have is our advanced mechs."
The Avatars of Myth employed the Crystal Lord in greater numbers than anyone else. Not only did they possess four exclusive gold label copies, they also fielded a whopping twenty silver label Crystal Lords.
Fabricating them all out of the LMC’s own pocket cost the company a lot. Almost the entire board of directors howled when Calsie and Melkor came up with the plan, but they pushed through regardless of the pain. At least Grandpa Benjamin remained ambivalent about the matter.
Naturally, the LMC also spent itself broke by expanding their number of production lines. They had no choice but to go further into debt, with the excuse that the company would be better off with the extra defenses.
Though the LMC’s mountain of debt had ballooned, the production lines had been put to good use. Mechs started flying off the premises as fast as they could produce, and the extra per-unit licensing fees streaming in from the third-party manufacturers did much to reassure the frazzled Financial Department.
"Do you think we’ve moved too fast?" Calsie asked as she turned away from the window and its marvellous view. "I’ve taken the company into a direction that won’t make Ves very happy. We’re knee-deep in debt and heavily reliant on our partners to keep the sales volume of our prodcut lines high."
Melkor dismissively huffed. "Ves is a little too selfish for his own good. He expects everything to dance at the palm of his hands. I’m not an expert in business, but from what I see, the faster we get things done, the better we’re all off. We needed those mechs in our hands as fast as possible."
"Why so? Are the Vesians winning?"
"Not as such. Simply think of it as a contingency. It’s better to go into debt and have the mechs ready than the other way around. The previous raid on the Mech Nursery has made that more than clear to me. What does a healthy balance sheet mean against the Mech Legion? No matter how exemplary the LMC handles its finances, it’s of little use when civilization gets thrown out the window in order to make way for war. The only thing that counts in a fight is how many mechs and weapons we possess. That’s the true measure of wealth in my eyes. Ma’am."
"Excellently said, commander. Money that’s sitting in the bank is of no use at all when the Mech Legion comes again. Only money that is spent on increasing our strength can make a difference during wartime." Calsie replied with a smile. She always felt uneasy about her decisions, but Melkor’s reasoning provided her with the mental crutch she needed to alleviate her guilt. "I’m sure that Ves won’t be pleased if he returns from his tour of service with the Mech Nursery in ruins."
Compared to this piece of mind, dealing with difficult and pushy creditors hardly seemed like a bother to her now. "Why have you come? Our next scheduled meeting is in three days."
"It’s about the Crystal Lord. I’ve finished my own investigation about its... effects."
"Oh? Do tell me the results."
As the mech pilot of one of the coveted gold label Crystal Lord mechs, Melkor possessed a unique opportunity to experience the best of what Ves had fashioned into being.
"Piloting the Crystal Lord is an entire experience. There is nothing routine about this mech. Everything I enter the cockpit and before I even engage the neural interface, I feel as if my mech is already welcoming me home."
"What do you mean? Are you saying that the Crystal Lord is running an AI even in its active state?"
"Nothing like that, ma’am. It’s... hard to describe. I can feel from my heart that I belong to my mech, and my mech belongs to me. Even now, I can’t bear to be away from my precious mech."
"That sounds unhealthy. Have you checked with the doctors?"
"We have performed more than enough tests to rule out any explicit brainwashing. In that, our investigations concur with the ones done by the Mech Corps and any other pundit who have tested this out."
"Then I don’t see what the problem is. Certainly, the reason why you feel addicted to your mech is because it’s a really good machine, right?"
"Right. Something like that. My apologies, ma’am. I’m not the best with words."
"No need to apologise. You are doing good work as the commander of a company-sized outfit."
The two discussed a little bit more about the Crystal Lord. Since the Avatars possessed the largest amount of Crystal Lords, they gained a lot of practical insights about the model. Melkor conveyed what they learned to Calsie so she could use the information to tweak the marketing of the product or introduce some other changes.
As they spoke, they kept a respectful distance from each other, both physically and status-wise. For whatever reason, Ves chose to appoint Calsie at the helm, so she took precedence over the mech pilot.
Melkor didn’t mind. As long as Calsie did a decent job and avoided steering the LMC into disaster, he wouldn’t mind taking orders from her. Of course, he constantly kept his eye on her in the event she took the wrong turn.
"How is the ship component of the Avatars doing? Your force is about to receive the first Trieste-class light carrier from the shipyard, if I recall. Are you prepared?"
"To be honest, no." Melkor shook his head. "We’re having difficulty recruiting competent and reliable spacers to staff a single ship, let alone two. Fleet Commander Rofane is doing his best, but the hiring market is practically dried up. Anyone with the skills to serve on a spaceship have already been snapped up by companies and outfits left and right."
"This doesn’t sound very good." Calsie frowned. "Can’t we hire from abroad?"
"I’m not very keen to hire foreign spacers. The chance of something going wrong is unacceptably high. I’d rather keep the light carriers in a depot collecting dust than rush them into use while they are riddled with hidden threats."
"What does Rofane think?"
"The fleet commander is less than enthused by my opinions. In his view, spacers are spacers. Once they sail the endless night, they have renounced their ties to the land. He’s a true-blooded spaceborn ship driver, that’s for sure."
Fleet Commander Rofane had been recommended to lead the ship contingent of the Avatars by Captain Silvestra. He was an old but boisterous barrel of a man who worked for several mercenary corps in his lifetime.
Though he was highly competent and his record was straight, he possessed rather strong beliefs about the superiority of spaceborn humans over their landbound counterparts. Keeping the outspoken fleet commander in line was very troublesome to Melkor.
"On some days, I regret accepting Rofane into the fold." Melkor continued. "He’s constantly pushing me to lift the restrictions on recruiting foreigners so he can hire more spaceborn spacers. I don’t want to make the problem any worse than it is right now with him alone, so I’ve been fobbing him off."
"I’m not sure if Ves will mind too much if you recruit some people who come from another state. As long as they aren’t Vesians and are willing to commit to the Avatars, they should be fine and dandy."
Melkor shook his head. "I can’t take the risk, ma’am. Although Ves explicitly set up the Avatars of Myth to serve as his personal force, true loyalty can’t be bought. We are much more like a mercenary corps in that regard. Nationality is the only thing we have in common. Once I throw that away, the Avatars would have nothing else to bind them all together."
As much as Melkor wanted to loosen the reins, he resisted the temptation. It was better to solve the problem over time rather than commit to an irreversible course of action.
"For now, we have no need for you to deploy the Avatars elsewhere, but that might change in the future."
For now, the Avatars of Myth had been tasked with defending the Mech Nursery. The lack of ships didn’t affect their operations as long as they stuck to this mission.
Still, circumstances changed, and if a crisis ever happened in a different star system, the Avatars would be forced to rely on others to transport their mechs to their destination. This took way too much time and money, and transport services generally refused to convey a shipment of mechs into danger. This highlighted the eventual need to own a wholly-owned carrier fleet.
Now that he was here, Melkor might as well get some other things off his chest. "By the way, though I try to stay out of your business decisions, aren’t you intertwining the LMC a little too deeply with Cloudy Curtain?"
Almost as soon as Ves entered the Mech Corps and dropped off the grid, Calsie implemented a fairly significant policy change within the company.
Under the reign of Ves, the LMC had always stood aloof from local politics and society. Besides settling on the planet, pushing some marketing and paying some taxes, the company didn’t make itself felt.
Calsie changed all of that. She rejected the premise that the LMC benefited best if it took on a completely neutral stance. Instead, she firmly pushed the LMC into a path of greater integration and cooperation with local stakeholders.
This policy of engagement took on many forms. For example, as deep as the LMC was already in debt, it spared some cash to subsidize the underfunded mech academies of Freslin. The institutions all praised the LMC for the much-needed rain of funds.
On a higher level, the LMC also started to support some of the initiatives of the newly emboldened Pioneers, mostly by putting in a good word for the business-friendly activists. With the Greens and the White Doves suffering from an unprecedented amount of indignation, the Pioneers was at the cusp of taking over the thoroughly discredited Planetary Assembly.
To Melkor, the growing relationship between the LMC and the Pioneers started to reek.
"I don’t have to justify my decisions to you, but if you must know, a company can’t settle on a planet and pretend its a silo. The LMC is the most prominent company on Cloudy Curtain. How can it not give back to the community that has welcomed it with open arms?"
"I wouldn’t exactly describe it in that way, ma’a’m."
"Then let me rephrase it in a blunter manner." Calsie spoke. "The politics are rather turbulent right now. While the Republic’s investigators ultimately failed to find the culprits of the self-sabotage incident, everyone and their dogs know it’s the White Doves who are at fault. While they can still rely on the support of hardcore pacifists, average people have left their side in droves. This is the time the Pioneers need to make their case. As long as we can help them overcome this hurdle, the LMC will be rewarded with countless of benefits!"
"I take it you will receive some benefits as well?"
"This isn’t about me." Calsie shook her head. "This is about the future of the LMC. The company can’t ignore politics, and the Pioneers can’t achieve their aims without some help from local businesses. Only through combining our strengths will we both be able to achieve our goals and better everyone’s lives. This is called corporate social responsibility."
The woman sounded so slick when she said those words that Melkor could hardly think of a retort. Melkor knew that Calsie had always been connected with the Pioneers, but the way she flagrantly defied Ves in keeping the LMC neutral was something else. She made a very persuasive case why this was the best decision.
"Don’t take it too far. When Ves returns, he’ll have some words to say to you."
"I am aware of the consequences, commander. However, may I remind you that Ves didn’t put a bot in charge of the LMC. He wanted a human to represent his wishes because he needed someone who could think in this position. From a logical perspective, there are way too many reasons why we should get in bed with the Pioneers and not enough reasons to stick to ourselves."
"If that is what you think, ma’am."
Melkor couldn’t argue any further because the unofficial partnership paid a lot of dividends. They already got a lot of things done, the most important of which was to steer the decision to rebuild Cloudy Curtain’s spaceport at Freslin instead of Orinoco. This provided a lot of convenience to the LMC as it constantly shipped in raw materials and shipped out finished mechs.
As Calsie and Melkor discussed some other matters, life went on at Cloudy Curtain.
One of the more impactful ways the LMC intruded into the sphere of the local inhabitants was that it took over or set up various businesses in Freslin under an LMC-branded investment group.
They mainly took on the form of sports and social clubs, as culture was something that Cloudy Curtain had always been lagging behind. The LMC also took over the faltering businesses of local craftsmen and entrepreneurs who offered something unique but never gained enough exposure and market reach.
The city of Freslin lapped it all up. The entire local region experienced an upsurge in interest as the LMC single-handedly brought up its educational, cultural and business standards.
"That mech company is the best thing to grace our planet since our founding!"
"Mr. Larkinson is a hero to us! Even as he’s gotten rich, he hasn’t forgotten about the little man!"
"We should kick the White Doves off our planet! To think they want to deprive us of all of these benefits. When I think back on how I supported them in the past, I should have deserved a kick in the head!"
While Freslin experienced an upsurge, the nominal capital of Cloudy Curtain suffered from a worsening sentiment. None of the cheer from Freslin had managed to reach as far as Orinoco. As the rescue services excavated the corpses and the construction companies cleaned up the ruins, the city was at a crossroads on how to proceed.
The average citizens started to lose faith in the ruling coalition, and that was really bad, because the people in Orinoco used to be their strongest supporters.
The Greens began to distance themselves from their bosom buddy. Although the Greens and the White Doves were often mentioned in the same sentence as if they were a single entity, in truth the Greens believed in somewhat distinct ideals.
This was why they also escaped much of the blame that had befallen the White Doves. Pretty much everyone in Orinoco believed they had been behind the bombs that exploded the spaceport and headquarters of several important businesses in the city. Though they full-heartedly denied the accusations, public opinion did not care for the absence of proof.
The White Doves possessed the right motive, and that was enough to establish a link.
"Look at how Freslin is partying every day. Why can’t we get some of that love?"
"As long as the White Doves are in charge over here, there’s no way in hell the LMC will think about us."
"Maybe it’s time the White Doves take a hike and build a hippy enclave in the wilderness. There’s plenty of open space on our planet. They can pack up their stupid beliefs and take them away from here so we can finally enjoy some economic development!"
"Let’s kick out the Greens as well! They love their forests so much that they can build a city in the trees!"
As much as public sentiment had turned against the established powers, change was rather slow in coming. Cloudy Curtain was still coming off a state of emergency, and a war raged on the wider Republic. For now, the ruling coalition earned a grace period which they could use to shore up their falterning support.
In the background, the representatives of the two dominant farming consortiums looked at the changes being wrought on Cloudy Curtain. Their expressions didn’t look happy.
"We have been hiding our claws for far too long. Whoever among us who predicted that the LMC would stay a small and niche mech manufacturer has obviously missed the mark."
"How can I know that this devilish Mr. Larkinson is such an abnormally good mech designer?! The speed in which he progressed is inhuman! Don’t forget that all you initially dismissed him as a threat early on!"
"Now now, settle down. This is no time for recriminations. Despite the worrying trends happening on our planet, it is not a given that we should make a move."
Someone from the Luvon Consortium stood up. "We can’t stand by and let the White Doves collapse on itself!"
"We can and we will." A powerful voice from the Raleigh Consortium interjected. "No matter how much we dislike the direction that Cloudy Curtain is heading, we should adapt to the times. Our previous posture of total isolation is a mistake."
"You are sounding dangerously like a Pioneer."
"Pioneer, Green, White Dove, these are all labels. What matters is keeping our Consortiums relevant. As much as the LMC sucks up all the spotlight right now, the farms of Cloudy Curtain will always be its main export product."
The conference fell to a momentary silence. Tension ratcheted up between the Raleigh Consortium, which favored the Greens, and the Luvon Consortium, who supported the White Doves.
Eventually, someone from the Luvons spoke. "We are not willing to let our political enterprise fall like that. To that end, we have prepared a plan that can reverse our setbacks and return the planet to the old order."
"What are you cooking up?"
"Something drastic. I’m afraid I can’t say. Leaking the details would be devastating to us and our cause. Let us take care of everything. I can guarantee you that the LMC will cease to exist when we enact our plans."
The conference ended with those ominous words. The Raleigh Family exhibited a lot of worry about the plans of their historical allies, but without any further information, they could do nothing but stand from the sidelines.
"The Luvons talk big, but they are the ones who let the LMC grow from a cub into a tiger."
"These long years of peace on our planet has ossified their minds. Maybe we should seriously consider the overtures from the Pioneers from now on."
"Let us not act too hastily. I’m not sure what the Luvons intend to do, but it shouldn’t concern our interests. No matter who comes out on top, we should wait until the outcome is clear."
"As much as the alliance between the LMC and the Pioneers is growing in strength, the Raleighs and their White Doves are stronger than they appear. It’s not a given that they will lose. It depends on how much strength they want to reveal to the galaxy."
At the border regions, the war raged on. Occasionally, the Vesians pushed forth hard, leading to battles that engulfed thousands of mechs at once.
The outcomes of those battles were decidedly mixed. Most of the times, even if the Brighters repelled the Vesians, they sustained just as much losses. Both sides would be economically ruined if they continued to lose so many mechs at once, so after the initial pushes, the Vesians slowed their pace by a little bit.
Nonetheless, the Vesian aggression could not be contained. The need for the nobles to one-up each other and distinguish themselves in battle led to grueling back-to-back battles in some of the hotspots of the border regions. Planets like Citadel Havensworth became littered with so much wrecks that neither side could afford the time to salvage them all.
It was said that during a war, the true facets of man would be revealed. Many mech pilots who thought themselves heroes turned out to be the first to eject. Others went through life without challenges, but measured up in the face of adversity, such as Ghanso Larkinson of the 1st Volari Starhawks.
Most mech pilots didn’t exhibit any differences. They knew their calling in life and signed up to pilot a mech knowing that they would face the Vesians in battle. Even someone who disdained the war such as Melinda Larkinson resolved to do their duty.
Despite their noble striving, the war did not go in the Bright Republic’s favor. The Vesians scored several important victories that brought strategic star systems into their fold. Each star system that fell paved the way for deeper incursions into Republic space.
One remote star system close to the border faced a small but determined assault from a Vesian mech regiment known as the 3rd Kallas Carabiniers.
The Carabiniers heavily favored medium rifleman mechs in their mech lineup. Versatile and deadly in great numbers, they trained extensively and came up with many advanced tactics to maximize the potential of their ranged mechs.
Right now, the Herendal System which held a modest amount of mines suffered an invasion by this regiment. The Mech Corps only stationed a couple of mech companies on the planet, and none of them were line units capable of facing the Vesians in a head-on clash.
The only way the defenders of the only inhabited planet of Herendal could keep their grip on the system was to employ a large amount of mercenaries.
Several large-scale mercenary corps answered the call. Though the mission entailed a lot of risks, the they payoff was big so long as the Vesians didn’t invade.
With regards to missions, every mercenary corps hoped to spend some months in quiet, boring patrols. Though they earned their living from their battle capabilities, fighting the Mech Legion was a daunting prospect.
In general, the Mech Legion did not often bother to invade small, unimportant star systems. Mercenary commanders relied on this fact to gamble on their missions. If they lucked out, they enjoyed a nice vacation while earning lots of pay to boot. If their luck fell short, then they’d be forced to back up their commitments and do their best to fight off the Vesians.
Barras Swan happened to have chosen badly. As the commander of a medium-sized band of mechs called the Orange Liskers, he chose to gamble on a quiet posting to the Herendal System. Though the star system was a little closer to the frontlines than he liked, the Liskers needed the pay as it went deep into debt to replace its previous battle losses.
"I should have never bought this mech! Though if I did, I would have never experienced this beauty either!"
The reason why Barras was so desperate to earn a large reward was because he impulsively ordered a copy of the Crystal Lord.
Even though he only purchased the bronze label version of this line of mechs, the expenditure almost broke the Liskers, with many of the rank and file grumbling why Barras spent so much but only kept the best for himself.
He was guilty in charge. The truth was that Barras felt tired about piloting another subpar rifleman mech that cost around 20-30 million credits. He thought about buying a new mech in the price segment above that figure, but when he heard about the amazing capabilities of the Crystal Lord, he settled his eyes on the ominous-looking model as soon as possible.
Some days, he regretted his purchase, and on other days he felt thankful about it. For now, Barras felt both as his battered Crystal Lord continued to run through the brownish forest of this terraformed planet.
Barras panted inside the cockpit of his Crystal Lord. "It’s been two days already! How can they still be in pursuit?!"
The swift and nimble mechs of the 3rd Kallas Carabiniers landed on Herendal with a splash. They immediately smashed apart the mech companies of the Mech Corps before turning their firepower to the mercenaries that tried to come to the aid of the defending mechs.
All hell broke loose. The critical fault that brought the defenders down was that they consisted of many different outfits. The Mech Corps occasionally bossed them around, but they lacked convincing power due to their limited numbers.
Right now, the Carabiniers succeeded in smashing hundreds of mechs at a time by defeating the different outfits one by one. They actively shied away from larger concentration of mercs, and only engaged when they outnumbered their prey.
It was a very despicable way to fight, but it worked. The Carabiniers moved fast and managed to hit the outfits before they finished their preparations. Right now, they employed their considerable edge in speed into hunting down the stragglers that split in every direction and ran for the hills.
"Goddammit, I should have never gave in to my greed!"
A scattering of laser beams struck from behind. The raking fire briefly added another scorch mark to his Crystal Lord’s back. Yet remarkably, the rear armor largely held up. The thin layer of Veltrex armor proved to be highly effective in absorbing short bursts of energy weapon fire. As long as Barras immediately jinked his mech, he could make sure that no single spot on his mech suffered from a sustained burst of fire.
"At least I’m getting my money’s worth!"
The combination of armor and speed on the Crystal Lord allowed for unexpected synergies. It performed extremely well against laser weapons, which happened to be the mainstay weapon of the Kallas Carabiniers. The Crystal Lord lasted much longer against them for that reason alone.
Still, that hadn’t been enough to turn the tide in the opening battle of the Orange Liskers. Barras had to witness first-hand how each of his trusted comrades-in-arms faltered due to the disparity in discipline and battle spirit. Some of them managed to eject, while others breathed their last on Herendal.
Tears began to well up in his eyes, but Barras quickly shook them away. Everyone who took up the mercenary life accepted the risks that came with this vocation. It was a rough and dangerous life, but one which mech pilots also enjoyed a lot of freedom.
Thoughts of vengeance percolated in his mind. Barras checked his fuel and battery reserves and noted that both were critically low. Even if his mech provided him with an amazing amount of endurance, two days of constant chasing took their toll.
"I can’t run any further without shaking off my pursuers."
The Crystal Lord slowed down in its steps as Barras prepared his exhausted mind for yet another battle, which might be his last this time.
The pursuing mechs emerged from the trees, and as soon as they got a clear view of the Crystal Lord, they fired their laser rifles at it without hesitation.
Some of the laser fire raked the crystal embedded in the center of the chest, while the rest of the energy splashed harmlessly against the armor of the premium mech, though some sections of plating started to get dangerously thin.
Barras ignored incoming fire and aimed carefully before shooting a high-powered beam from his surprisingly slim rifle. The laser hit one of the Carabinier mech and burned a nasty gash at its leg armor. Though the laser failed to penetrate the internals, another hit might finish the job.
As Barras waited for his rifle to cycle away the heat, he immersed himself in his mech and moved nimbly between the trees. Though the tree trunks looked substantial, they could not be used as cover as most laser beams instantly burned through them. Barras mainly took the presence of the trees as mental comfort.
"Three opponents. They’ve been running for a while as well. They don’t look as fresh as before."
The Carabiniers had split up their forces in order to mop up the routed defenders. While the models of the Carabiniers couldn’t rival the longevity of the Crystal Lord, they regularly rotated the mechs on the field by deploying transports in the air. The fact that they secured orbital and aerial supremacy meant that they could shuttle around their mechs with near-impunity.
However, they still needed to be cautious in the presence of an enemy ranged mech like the Crystal Lord. Barras almost managed to burn through the armor of one transport that strayed too near.
"If my estimates on their timing is correct, then this trio should have been switched out in an hour. This is the best time for me to thwart their pursuit!"
Barras hated himself for getting away when much of his men and women got killed or captured by the Carabiniers. He channeled his fury through his mech, who seemed to be as eager for battle as him. Several strange insights started to flow past his mind as his mind studied the terrain and his opponents for any potential opportunities.
"There!"
Barras drove his Crystal Lord back, which sprung like a gymnast as it turned around and ran towards a certain destination. The three Carabiniers jumped in pursuit.
The Crystal Lord didn’t need to run very far before it reached a rushing river. Barras hesitated for a moment, but jumped his mech knee deep into the waters. A large bout of steam escaped from the lower surface of the mech as the persistent heat it built up started to dissipate into the cold, rushing water.
The Carabiniers caught up again and started to fire at the Crystal Lord. Due to being in the water, its mobility had become affected, leading to serious damage. Some of the internals even started to get exposed!
That was when the Crystal Lord unleashed two laser beams at once. It bracketed the Carabinier with the damaged leg from two directions. Though the mech dodged away from an incoming beam, it did not expect the other beam released from the Crystal Lord’s chest. It got hit in the leg!
"Yes!"
Barras quickly adjusted the aim of his rifle and managed to compound upon the damage to the leg of the faltering mech. Its momentary slowdown proved fatal as the laser beams finally burned past the thin leg armor and wrecked the internals.
The Carabinier mech collapsed onto its knees.
Barras had no time to finish it off. It kept wading through the waters, moving away from the immobilized mech while the other two Carabiniers focused on taking down their persistent prey.
"Hahahaha!" Barras laughed as he saw the chest crystal getting charged up again. Though its capacity wasn’t very great, it fired off many times more than the crystal of a gold label mech.
Again, Barras repeated the same trick that snagged another Carabinier. This time, he hit the mech in the chest, which didn’t amount to a lot of damage.
"Damn!"
It took a couple of successive hits to finally penetrate its chest armor. At this point, the Carabinier who piloted the mech fell back. It had no choice but to do so, because one more hit would have disabled or destroyed the mech.
"Now, there is only one."
The only problem for Barras was that his laser rifle’s last battery pack was spent. "Tch! If only they didn’t destroy my backpack module!"
The Crystal Lord kept all of its spare battery packs in its backpack module. That worked fine most of the time, but in a running engagement like this, it had been one of the first things to be destroyed.
"I can only put my faith on this crystal."
After making a decision, Barras resolutely turned around his Crystal Lord and charged the remaining Carabinier. The Vesian mech had seen two of its fellow mechs falter in succession against this supremely tenacious mech, and its mech pilot was starting to feel the pressure.
Laser beams raked the Crystal Lord in a chaotic manner. Only some of it hit the exposed internals, while the rest splashed against the mostly-intact sections of armor.
A significant amount of energy channeled into the chest crystal as the laser beams kept comping. Once it had reached saturation, it unleashed a tight but potent laser beam that Barras aimed straight at the enemy’s laser rifle.
The weapon got hit, and promptly malfunctioned. Both sides lost their primary weapons and resorted to their backup knives. The Carabinier started to back away, but the Crystal Lord wouldn’t have any of it. Barras was fully engaged in the fight and wanted nothing more than to dish some hurt onto his pursuers.
A brief but brutal exchange took place. The Carabinier mech was of worse quality than the Crystal Lord. Its uncompressed armor allowed the Crystal Lord’s weak knife stabs to enter after a couple of sustained stabs.
Barras screamed as the Crystal Lord’s knife slipped through the cockpit of the enemy mech. The Carabinier mech futilely tried to stab its knife through the exposed weak points of its adversary, but Barras constantly kept his mech moving to avoid getting pinned down in such a manner.
Eventually, the Crystal Lord hadn’t let him down. The mech stood over the fallen Vesian mech, worn and almost out of fuel. Barras laughed ruefully at himself as he looked at this situation.
"This is both the best and worst purchase I have ever made."
Georgia Lyall turned to the main recorder of the news program. "In our next segment, let us talk about the latest mech model that has upended the upper segment of the rifleman mech market."
"Are you talking about the Gizlin Mark IV?" A fat pundit who proudly referred to himself as Osmon the Mech Sage probed.
Another pundit on the panel shook his head. "That’s the wrong price segment. We’re not talking about that cheap piece of trash that falls whenever it encounters a breeze!"
"Professor Marklen is right." Georgia nodded. "The mech model I’m referring to is the iconic-looking Crystal Lord!"
A projection of its design and some key specs started to appear from the table in the middle of the studio.
"Designed by Ves Larkinson, this premium rifleman mech model comes in three different variants, and are mainly distinguished by quality. The so-called gold and silver label mechs are produced by Mr. Larkinson’s own Living Mech Corporation, while the more affordable bronze label mechs are left to various licensed manufacturers."
"I do have to say that the bronze label Crystal Lord is barely representative of this excellent design!" The Mech Sage interrupted in a brisk manner as he swigged a glass of beer. "I’ve seen all three labels in person, and the only mechs worth a damn are the ones produced by the LMC and no one else!"
"Ahem," Georgia tried to wave the Mech Sage down. "As I was saying, the Crystal Lord entered the market with a minor stir due to its extreme features, many of which has elicited a lot of arguments over the galactic net."
The news anchor proceeded to list the notable traits of the Crystal Lord, from its lightweight but resilient construction for a medium mech to the strange gimmicks incorporated in the chest and rifle of the mech. Lastly, she addressed the pricing of the mech.
"As of this moment, the gold label Crystal Lords are nearly impossible to obtain. As a variant that is prized for its exquisite quality and excellent performance in battle, the main reason why they are so hard to obtain is because it bears the privilege of being handmade by Mr. Larkinson."
"A Larkinson, you say?" The Mech Sage popped up again. "Any relations to ’those’ Larkinsons?"
"Ves Larkinson is indeed related to the famous military family. In fact, his grandfather is none other than Benjamin Larkinson!"
"Splendid! No wonder his mechs are so fantastic! The Larkinsons know their mechs, that’s for sure! Did I ever tell you how I made a bet with Ark Larkinson back when we were in boot camp? We bet on who could last out in the cold out in the dark at night at our desolate training camp the longest! The winner would get all of the porridge the both of us received from the mess hall for a week. Did you know what happened?"
Georgia sighed inwardly, but she maintained her smile because she knew the mech nerds that watched her program lapped up these kinds of stories. The Mech Sage wouldn’t have been a mainstay of her news portal otherwise.
"What happened?"
"The drill instructors immediately put a stop to our bet, but afterwards immediately kicked us out in the cold for the rest of the night! We shivered and shivered and hugged each other’s bodies to keep ourselves warm! It was one the most miserable nights I’ve ever spent in my life!"
Imagining the famous Colonel Ark Larkinson as a scruffy young mech pilot spending the night out in the cold with nothing but another buddy for warmth must have sent the audience cracking. Georgia possessed a thin implant over her eyes that indicated that her audience indeed reacted positively to the anecdote.
Sometimes, she wondered why she ever agreed to host a broadcast program about mechs.
Still, lots of people watched those shows, and the pay was good, so Georgia maintained her smile and pressed on. "That’s interesting to hear, but let us get back to the Crystal Lord. Initially, the models entered the market with a whisper. The specs looked attractive, but the pricing scared many people away. The initial sales came from those who attended the product reveal. All of them we’ve interviewed were ecstatic about the Crystal Lord models."
"Who can blame them?" Professor Marklen interjected this time. "This dangerous line of mechs possess a powerful capacity to manipulate the judgement of any person that comes near one of these dangerous mechs. They are an abomination and should have never passed validation! I don’t know what the MTA is doing these days, but whoever validated this monstrosity of a design should be executed for treason!"
Georgia knew she had to intervene. "Now now, professor, let us not cast any blame upon the MTA here. The fine folks that keep human space in check are nothing if not thorough."
Marklen obviously disagreed, but he received a quiet signal that he should firmly shut up about this topic. He had no choice but to comply.
Professor Marklen was another regular guest to the program, though he didn’t appear as much as the Mech Sage. He was a bona fide mech designer, but was merely an assistant professor to a small institution on Bentheim. His main value in the program lay in the fact that despite holding the title of professor, he possessed a lot of eccentrics thoughts.
"I still think the LMC has the ethical duty to pull the Crystal Lord from the market." Marlken persisted, this time making sure he didn’t involve the MTA in his argument. "While by all accounts the neural interface is a bog-standard reproduction of a standard model that is prevalent in many designs in the Republic, we can still constitute that everyone who has ever piloted a Crystal Lord or came into viewing distance of it became strangely affected."
The Mech Sage slammed his meaty palm against the table top while letting out a burp. "Maybe they just appreciate a good mech! With so many crappy designs being published these days, the young Larkinson’s latest work is a breath of fresh air."
Georgia nodded, seemingly in agreement. "There are even rumors percolating over the galactic net that the Crystal Lord design is even eligible to be nominated for the Best Mech Design of the Year in the Junior category. What do you say about this possibility?"
"It’s outrageous!" Marklen screeched. "Safety studies have barely started on the Crystal Lord, and already the mech industry wants to elevate it onto a pedestal? That is highly irresponsible! There are too many oddities with this mech, from the alien-derived crystal technology to the way it assimilates everyone it gets in touch with. I want to reiterate that I want to see this design banned!"
The Mech Sage laughed again. "Hahahaha! That’s the funniest thing I’ve heard in a week. There’s no way the Crystal Lord will be taken off the market. You’ll have half the market rising up in protest. For better or worse, the Crystal Lord is peaking in popularity. Everyone wants a piece of it, and the mech manufacturers aren’t pumping them out fast enough."
"Why has the Crystal Lord become such a remarkable success despite its tepid introduction? If you take away the magnetism of the mech and look at the numbers on the spec sheet, the mech provides poor value for money."
"Ah, that is what everybody thought, but they were wrong." The Mech Sage waggled his fat finger. "Some of the features of the Crystal Lord don’t sound very impressive on their own, but taken together, they are actually able to reinforce each other. For example, cladding a fast mech with a thin layer of compressed armor normally doesn’t do too much, but the Crystal Lord is really, really fast."
"Does that make any difference?"
"It makes a huge difference! The faster you move, the more damage you can spread out over your entire frame! The speed of the Crystal Lord is really unreal for a medium mech. It’s almost like a light mech in a sense. Though its agility is a little worse, its fast enough to prevent any ranged mechs from focusing their fire on a single component of the Crystal Lord. That massively improves its survivability on the battlefield."
Professor Marklen did not agree, or rather he was not willing to let the Crystal Lord become more attractive in the eyes of the audience. "All of that sounds great, but you are overlooking two important factors. All of that running around will wear out the Crystal Lord. For a design that is prized for its endurance and longevity, its parts can’t keep up with extensive use. Already we are hearing stories about some parts fallen off the Crystal Lord after surviving a stressful engagement."
"That’s only the case with the bronze label variants! None of the silver and gold label Crystal Lords have reported any excessive wear and tear!"
"Not yet, but the designs for the three labels are functionally the same, barring a few exceptions. It’s impossible for this problem to be absent in the more expensive versions of the Crystal Lord. As I was saying, the problem of accelerated wear and tear is compounded by the fact that this mech is really expensive to maintain. Much of the value from this design comes from its premium materials. Repairs on the field are impossible to perform because the components of the Crystal Lord require a whole laundry list of raw materials to reproduce."
This was a problem that some ecastic owners of the Crystal Lord had just begun to encounter. From the Trailblazer engine to the crystals, from the Veltrex armor system to the HRF armor system, Larkinson’s design utilized too many different raw materials in its construction.
Mech technicians already started to hate the design for being so difficult to repair in the field.
"You know, back when I was making a name for myself in the previous war, a lot of repairs are improvised patchworks. Even the mechs that are designed in-house can’t be restored to their original condition on any battlefield environment. The mech designers leading over the mech technicians have always made do with whatever they could get their hands on. Sometimes, to patch a hole in the armor, they even resorted to plain steel!"
"That does not disprove my original point." The professor persisted. "Even in times of momentary peace, it’s a strain on logistics to supply all the raw materials to fabricate replacements parts. That reminds me, the second reason why the Crystal Lord is a burden to any outfit is the fact that its much-praised Trailblazer engine only accepts medium-density mech-grade fuel."
"It’s a fuel-efficient engine design from the Friday Coalition!"
"Just because it comes from the Friday Coalition doesn’t mean it deserves an automatic seal of approval. The Trailblazer engine is not an engine design that has been formed by one of the Coalition’s famous equipment designers or manufacturers. It has instead come from the hand of a single mech designer. It is inevitable that his biases have affected his design. The Trailblazer engine might be efficient if used in the Coalition, but here in the Bright Republic medium-density fuel is getting harder and harder to obtain."
"The refineries are still up and running." The Mech Sage sullenly said.
"For how long? Fuel refineries are the number two or three highest priority targets that the Mech Legion always aims to destroy. If past trends holds true to the present, then we can expect the price of medium-density fuel to double or triple in the middle phase of the war."
That was something that the Crystal Lord design couldn’t do anything about. Every customer that bought the Crystal Lord for long-term value would eventually start to wince when they received their fuel bills."
"Is this enough to take the Crystal Lord out of contention for Best Mech Design of the Year?" Georgia asked, spotting an opportunity to get back on the foreground of the discussion.
"This isn’t a possibility. It’s an ironclad fact." Marklen confidently spoke. "The Crystal Lord may be enjoying its time in the spotlight right now, but sooner or later the public will shake away the brainwashing and wise up to the truth!"
Georgia smiled as she received another bit of news from the producer. "Well, I’m afraid you’ll have to be disappointed, because word has just come in. The Bentheim Mech Court has just announced their shortlist of nominations for the Junior category of Best Mech Design of the Year, and Mr. Larkinson’s Crystal Lord is in the list!"
A groundswell of astonishment spread throughout the audience that watched the program. Other news portals and mech portals quickly released the same news, confirming the rumors that the Crystal Lord was in contention to receive a prestigious reward!
The true worth of a mech designer lay not in their skills or experience, but in the quality of their designs.
One did not necessarily lead to the other.
Even if a mech designer possessed a genius-level intelligence and enjoyed extensive tutoring from renowned Masters, his products might still end up lackluster and without inspiration.
This often happened in high-pressure learning environments in the galactic center and the galactic rim. Their abundant wealth and population enabled many hopefuls to study mech design. Yet once they entered the ultra-competitive mech markets there, they instantly got swamped.
They learned in the most brutal fashion that to be a successful mech designer, they needed to be more than technically adept. They needed to have a sense of art and craftsmanship.
"Mech design is both a science and an art. Among two functionally similar designs, the one which resonates more with the people will always have an edge."
Artistic sense could be trained, but only up to a certain point. It was something which could never be defined or measured in hard numbers. What one person found beautiful, another person might think of it as trash.
The key to mech design was to design a mech that appealed to a broad audience. If that couldn’t be done, then it should at least be attractive to its target audience.
To be nominated to win the award for Best Mech Design of the Year, a design had to possess more than technical prowess, though that was also indispensable.
The Crystal Lord design happened to be strong at both. The product line exhibited pretty good specs and possessed a clean and mostly faultless design.
However, the main qualities that pushed it into contention to win an award was its inexplicable effect at impacting both bystanders and mech pilots alike. The mech possessed a weight to it that could hardly be seen in other mechs besides those that possessed a very special history.
Many mech designers who witnessed the copies in person and mech pilots who tried out the virtual copies in online games all puzzled over what made the Crystal Lord so special. When they compared the Crystal Lord to the Blackbeak, they noticed the same qualities, but at a weaker level.
Clearly, the Crystal Lord was not a fluke, and its compelling allure must have been a deliberate design feature. As mech designers and mech pilots puzzled over the mystery, word of mouth spread far and wide, and even foreign markets showed interest in importing the remarkable mechs.
All of this had made the powerful and influential Bentheim Mech Court take note. Besides presiding over difficult disputes and contentions in the mech industry, they also recognized the works of brilliant mech designers who resided in the Bright Republic.
That the Crystal Lord had been acknowledged by the Court was already an enormous honor. Though it only fell into contention in the lowest grade of its awards, demand had already spiked once the news leaked out.
All of this thrust the LMC into a spotlight, but sadly the mech designer who shaped the remarkable design was many light-years away from the spotlight. While his company accepted more and more accolades, Ves was cooped up in his newly-assigned office to prepare to take up his new duties.
Despite having cut off his connections to the mech industry back, Ves found it rather strange that his achievements directly led to a promotion in the hollowed-out design department of the 6th Flagrant Vandals.
He blinked and rubbed his eyes as he took a break from his reading. "The Crystal Lord must be selling like hotcakes right now if word of it had managed to reach the Vandals."
Though Ves still felt a little bewildered about it since his accomplishments back home shouldn’t have affected him like this, he decided to roll with the punches.
In preparation for the new tasks Professor Velten expected him to complete, Ves needed to get up to date with various protocols and technical data. The extra reading imposed on him didn’t help so much because much of the true secrets of the three actively developed designs of the Flagrant Vandals remained enclosed inside impenetrable black boxes.
Though it annoyed him to be deprived of how certain key components worked, he slowly realized that it wasn’t just a matter of secrecy. The professor also wanted to preserve his sanity. Spending the last couple of days trying to digest the new information already strained his mind somewhat, though his mental fortitude was a lot stronger than anyone realized.
"The so-called higher concepts don’t seem so nebulous now that I think about it." He muttered. "The main reason why they are so dangerous is because they can potentially ruin someone’s design philosophy."
From the brief instructions the professor had given him, Ves needed to be very prudent with what he read. Ves remembered what she said back then.
"The process of learning is one of the strengths of a civilized race. Each generation, the human race advances a little more because they learned from the mistakes of their predecessors. Yet we spend so much of our lifetime learning from others that we risk losing the ability to think for ourselves. There are lots of dangers involved with indiscriminate learning. Besides learning faulty information, you also risk narrowing your perspective on matters. Once this transfers to your developing design philosophy, you essentially become prematurely locked to someone else’s stance on mechs."
Basically, Velten wanted Ves to study up so he could be of more use, but not go too far with his learning unless he wanted to destroy his ability to cope with the unknown and design mechs that could truly be called as his own work.
Ves knew she had a point, and as much as Ves wanted to dismiss the risks, he couldn’t. Though he wouldn’t get confused by the higher concepts, the danger to design philosophy and artistic vision remained as potent as ever. The more he learned, the more he agreed with the solutions of the original designers, and the less he tried to figure out alternative solutions.
Designing mechs eventually needed a hands-on approach. The more successful mech designers never reached their heights by relying on learning alone. They also applied their knowledge and tested the boundaries between what they knew and didn’t know if it would be possible.
Thus, as much as Ves wanted to delve into the depths of the archives, he forced himself to pull away.
"I know enough about the three designs to get the gist of them all."
He mainly read up on the other two designs developed in-house by the Vandals. Both the Inheritor light skirmisher and the Akkara heavy cannoneer served vital purposes that underpinned many of the strategies employed by the Vandals. Ves needed to become as familiar to their nuances as he understood the Hellcat hybrid knight.
The Vandals heavily slanted towards spaceborn operations.
It was obvious that they designed the spaceborn Inheritor design to be fielded in large numbers. The mech excelled at raiding fleeing trade convoys, but was pretty much useless in many other situations.
The spaceborn Hellcat design served as the big brother of the Inheritor mechs. Larger, more powerful and exceedingly more expensive, the Vandals only needed a couple of them to stiffen up a company of Inheritor mechs.
As for the dual-purpose Akkara design, it provided the Vandals with a heavy amount of ranged firepower, albit in an immobile package. By sacrificing mobility, it was able to field a lot more firepower and armor than usual.
The Akkara basically served as the semi-mobile defense turrets of the Vandals, and was a very interesting design to Ves. Its unabashed simplicity should have made it an easy mech to design, but the truth was actually opposite as the design team responsible for its continuous development often slipped up due to the sheer amount of systems packed into the design.
"The Vandals aren’t too interested in fielding ranged mechs."
Ves got the sense that the Vandals treated the Akkara as a necessity. All-melee mech regiments were particularly vulnerable to being kited to death by faster ranged mechs.
Almost every mech regiment of the Mech Corps developed their own spin on rifleman mechs. Not the Vandals. They cared so little about ranged warfare that they would rather resort to Vesian mechs stolen from their targets during their raids.
From his additional reading, Ves learned the reason why. The Vandals found excessive amounts of ranged weapons to be very destructive. This was good if they wanted to obliterate their opponents, but often times they wanted to preserve as much as they could in order to derive some value out of their spoils of war.
"Melee mechs can control their damage output much more precisely than their ranged counterparts."
He didn’t forget about the fact that rifleman mechs caused the most amount of collateral damage out of all the different types. This was especially egregious in battles in space. An attack on a transport risked damaging its structural integrity. If the ship suffered too many attacks, it might break apart, spilling its cargo and often also ruined it all.
In that sense, almost every aspect of the Vandals was deliberately geared for raiding and raiding alone. Nothing about their mech usage suggested that they showed any interest in fighting pitched or defensive battles. They basically looked for the best way to bully a weaker adversary.
Before he went and liaised with the mech pilots about the Wolf Mother, Ves met up with Laida and Pierce in order to pick their brains. They worked extensively with the two designs and he could benefit from hearing from a different perspective.
The two other mech designers from his batch hadn’t achieved anything remarkable during their time in their design teams. Unlike Ves, they hadn’t been able to draw any attention to themselves. Their skills and accomplishments were too average to elicit any interests from their superiors.
This turned them rather bummed as they witnessed the sudden promotion of Ves. This made them rather cranky when Ves went up to them to hear what they had to say.
"The Inheritor design is a death trap." Laida spoke with frustration. "It’s a design that kills more mech pilots than any standard spaceborn skirmisher design from the central database. It doesn’t perform all that well and its armor is as thin as a datapad in some areas. Such a mech should have been abandoned at the start."
Ves did not expect such an outpouring of negativity. "Why do the Vandals place so much importance in it, then?"
"The only redeeming factors of the Inheritor are its price, ease of fabrication and speed. The most important goal of the Inheritor design was that it had to be easy to reproduce in a variety of circumstances. It tries to incorporate as little exotics and possible, and when it does require some, it would always be the cheapest or most abundantly available exotics that they could steal from the Vesians."
"So the Inheritor design is weak because that’s the price the Vandals pay for the ability to fabricate them anywhere?"
"Exactly. Its many weaknesses aren’t well-kept secrets. Frankly, any mech pilot would feel appalled by the lack of the robustness in its design. Even for a light mech, the Inheritor goes through extreme lengths to make them fast but affordable."
"Have you experienced the same shenanigans at the Akkara design team, Pierce?" Ves asked the other mech designer after he was done listening to Laida.
"We aren’t suffering from the same problems. Not a lot of mech pilots specialize in heavy mechs, so there will always be a shortage of heavy mech pilots."
"What about the design itself? Does it exhibit any weaknesses?"
Pierce took his time to answer the question. "It’s a work in progress. Every day, something changes, and not always for the better. From what I’ve experienced, the Vandals really don’t like this big lump of a mech. I think they’re even neglecting the design in some cases."
As Ves heard about the two mechs from his colleagues, his impression of their actual state worsened.
Understaffed design teams and combined with a lack of appreciation for all the effort put into the designs sounded really bad to him. He couldn’t do anything about the staffing, so instead he focused on changing everyone’s impression about these mechs.
The 6th Flagrant Vandals only appreciated the Hellcat design due to its iconic status within the mech regiment. Even then, the Vandals hadn’t actually invested a lot of resources into improving the design.
Even if the Mech Corps hardly sent any mech designers to the Vandals, couldn’t they have supplemented their design teams by hiring them on their own?
Ves didn’t understand why they placed so little importance to the design department. Professor Velten was supposed to be chummy with Colonel Lowenfield. Couldn’t the Senior Mech Designer make a better case for her department and stop its gradual deterioration?
"Well, I’ll be taking a look at another piece of the puzzle soon."
Once Ves finished his talks with the other two mech designer, he proceeded to take up his first task. This time, Professor Velten wanted him to focus his efforts towards the Inheritor design first.
"It’s the most prevalent model of the Vandals." The professor told him. "Therefore, I’d like to see if there is any way you can make a contribution to its design. Even a minor improvement can save dozens of lives due to how much the Vandals depends on this design."
Therefore, his first task was to listen to the people who worked with the Inheritor mechs on a day-to-day basis.
Ves looked down at his comm and set his destination. The device flickered to life and projected a small line that led him through the confusing maze of corridors of the massive factory ship.
"I’m finally stepping out of this cage."
As he went through the corridors and took a few lifts downwards, Ves saw lots of new things. He passed by several important compartments, such as a workshop that repaired broken mech components to a mineral processing area that turned raw asteroids into usable resources.
Each of these sights opened his eyes to what the Wolf Mother hosted. At the size of a capital ship, she could truly be called a mobile factory in space.
"There’s so much industry going on inside this ship."
He already knew in an abstract way that the Flagrant Vandals depended on the Wolf Mother along with a couple of smaller logistics ships to keep the entire mech regiment afloat. Yet he never got exposed to the extent to which the Vandals worked to make it possible.
Besides being struck by the scale of these operations was the fact that everyone who worked in these compartments wore the uniform of a Vandal. That basically meant that they were proper servicemen and not some kind of civilian help they picked off the streets.
It made sense for the Wolf Mother to be staffed by so many support personnel, but his estimate on how many people worked aboard the ship had to be adjusted upwards by several thousand people.
"Repairing broken mechs and fabricating new ones is a massive industry in itself."
Ves genuinely admired the entrepreneurial spirit of the Vandals. Without access to external sources of funding, the Vandals managed to scrape by on their own with the help of their factory ship. And besides the whacky FTL engine, the Wolf Mother was very well put together for a vessel that the Vandals constantly worked upon. Ves hardly noticed any flaws in the structural integrity of the areas he walked by.
After a long walk, he finally reached one of the hangars where the Vandals assigned a squad of spaceborn mechs. Though the Wolf Mother always tried to stay out of fights, sometimes the fight came to her. It was imperative for the factory ship to possess some means of defending herself.
As Ves came up to the nearest hangar, he went through a security check before being allowed inside.
"Wow."
The space wasn’t very big. Compared to the cavernous hangars of the Ark Horizon, the hangar he entered could only fit a squad of ten mechs and some spare machines. In order to save a lot of space, the ceiling of the hangar was kept as low as possible. This made it rather awkward to move around the spaceborn mechs as they couldn’t utilize their flight systems without mashing their heads to pieces.
After looking around, he spotted a Vandal wearing the markings of a chief technician. Ves waved at the woman and approached her as she supervised the modification process of an unknown Vesian mech.
"Chief Carnon?"
The middle-aged woman nodded her robust-looking head while she chewed a stimulant. "You must be the new kid the old hag told us about. She made you out to be some kind of mech whisperer. Well, you don’t look like it."
Chief Jezebel Carmon didn’t look to impressed with Ves, and he didn’t blame her for that. His official track record was rather thin and he was still very young to be working with designs on this level.
"Are all chiefs supposed to be acting as tough as nails?"
"It comes with the job. You try ordering around a bunch of numbskulls for a couple of years. My men will do the strangest things if I’m not around to keep them in line."
Chief technicians knew their way around with machines a lot better than the average mech technician, but their true value lay in their leadership abilities. Without their steady presence, any mech maintenance department would fall apart.
"I’m here to help with the Inheritor design. First up, can you lead me to a copy of this mech?"
"Sure. Follow me."
A couple of mech pilots milled about. With the Wolf Mother constantly travelling in FTL, there wasn’t a great need to keep the mech pilots on hand. Still, in the event the fleet she travelled with entered into an ambush, at least a couple of mech pilots needed to be ready and waiting at all times in order to deploy the moment the Wolf Mother returned to realspace.
Ves imagined the mech pilots of the Vandals to be a little rowdy, the opposite of the mech pilots of the elite regiments or companies. What he actually saw were mech pilots that fell in between.
They didn’t look as classy as someone like Captain Vicar, but neither did their appearances resemble the disheveled gang members of Walter’s Whalers.
If nothing else, they resembled highly disciplined mercenaries.
Chief Carmon led Ves to the nearest Inheritor, which also happened to be in a sorry state. Its razor-thin armor suffered gashes to its legs and its torso. His judgement told him that this inheritor had been targeted by a single rifleman mech.
A mech pilot stood in front of his mech with a pensive face. Upon sensing someone coming close, he turned around and greeted Carmon and the newcomer.
"Lieutenant Chandis, this is Ves Larkinson, a mech designer from the labs. He’s our latest liaison."
"I liked the old kid better." Chandis muttered, completely disregarding the fact that Ves stood in front of him. "That last mech designer was a good listener, and he always promised to convey my wishes to the professor."
"Lieutenant, I am not that mech designer. I’m much better than him, in fact."
The lieutenant chuckled. "Do you, now? We’ll see about that."
Ves looked around and tried to change the topic. He settled on the Inheritor that the mech technicians were in the process of beginning their repairs. "What happened to this mech?"
"Our opponents lucked out during the last raid. We steamrolled a Vesian trade convoy a few months back and made it out with a handsome amount of loot. It’s too bad the comrade who piloted this mech is still recovering in the infirmary.
"If this mech got damaged a few months ago, why hasn’t it been repaired yet?"
"We’re short-handed." The chief blunty replied, and waved her arm to encompass the entire hangar. "This is only one of several hangars aboard the Wolf Mother, and her maximum capacity pales in comparison to the dedicated hangars aboard a proper fleet or combat carrier. Hiring has always been difficult for us so we’re working at our wits end sometimes. It doesn’t help that the factory ship assigns most of the mech technicians to the production lines or the mineral processing machines."
"I see."
Same as the design department, it turned out the maintenance department suffered from a shortage of people as well. When Ves previously passed through the other compartments, he didn’t get the idea that they suffered from a shortage of skilled workers.
Strange. Why hadn’t the Vandals managed their manpower better? He would have thought that skimping out on the mech technicians led to many delays and mistakes with regards to servicing mechs. What were they thinking?!
Ves began to ask more questions about the Inheritor. He wanted to know why it looked so shot up after only suffering a couple of solid hits.
"The armor might as well not be there. It’s sufficient enough to resist small arms fire, but mech-sized weapons encounter no obstacle when they strike the Inheritor."
"Doesn’t it possess enough speed to mitigate most incoming attacks?"
"That’s what it’s supposed to do. The reality is that there are many situations where we have to slow down or stop. Just think about it. When we raid a trade or supply convoy, we have to match our speeds relative to the transport ships we’re aiming to raid. The delta vee will practically approach zero when we come close."
"What about its flight system?" Ves continued his questioning. "The Inheritor is supposed to possess a very high thrust-to-weight ratio. It shouldn’t be too difficult to keep jinking back and forth."
The lieutenant scoffed at that. "Jinking around like that all the time will eat up our energy cells and put more stress on the frame. The Inheritor is so fragile that there’s a very real risk of breaking something important if we shift our mechs in an abrupt manner."
"You don’t think much about the Inheritor, do you?"
"Yeah. Unlike the dumb recruits that trickle in from time to time, I’ve been a Vandal long enough to understand how badly we need to squeeze our budget. If it were up to me, I’d say we should throw away this worthless design and transition to whatever light mechs the Vesians are using."
"The higher ups already thought of that." Chief Carmon said. "They quickly decided that there’s no way they can rely on raiding to supplement our mechs because we can’t get enough light skirmishers. Every transport that ships over a batch of mechs always carry a hodgepodge of different designs. It’s really difficult to get the type of mechs we need the most."
"That still doesn’t mean the Inheritor has to be as thin and cheap as possible!" The lieutenant screamed back. This time, Ves could feel the force of the mech pilot’s indignity. "We have so many Inheritors lying around that we don’t know what to do with them. Why can’t we invest in tougher mechs that are a little more expensive to make than what we have right now?"
"I think it’s a numbers game to them." Ves speculated. "A smaller number of more capable mechs won’t be able to hold out against a large number of low-quality mechs. This is very important for a mech regiment like the Whalers. They need to spend their money as best as possible."
Ves did not dare to pass any judgement on that scheme. Instinctively, it made a lot of sense, but the constant casualties and the frequency of the mechs turning into floating wrecks in space remained very high.
It was as if this had been a deliberate choice.
The lieutenant showed Ves around the Inheritor after he finished his grumbling. Chief Carmon hovered close and commented on the uncommon features of the Inheritor design.
"You see these arms here? They’re one of the strongest parts of this mech, as skirmishers rely on their arms and how much weight they can put behind them to penetrate through armor. It sometimes gets really difficult to peel away the armor plating of a tough ship like a combat carrier."
Ves noticed that. Normally, it didn’t really hurt if the arms were oversized, since a spaceborn mech always fought in space. As long as the design balanced out the arms to the rest of the frame, it would still be able to fly in space on a stable trajectory.
"Are there any problems with the arms?"
"Not as such, but I have a couple of pet peeves about them." The lieutenant replied.
Ves nodded as he inspected and touched the arms up close. The scarred and tarnished alloys felt cool to his touch. "Let’s hear it then."
Lieutenant Chandis had a complaint for practically every aspect of the Inheritor model. Much of the reason why was because its design had been tailored for what the higher ups thought what was best for the entire mech regiment.
The wishes of the individual mech pilots who would have to rely on these death traps to survive in space hardly registered in comparison. Every improvement needed to be weighed against more practical concerns such as cost and ease of fabrication. If either of these two factors became negatively impacted, then Professor Velten wouldn’t approve of the changes.
Therefore, much of the complaints he heard from Chandis had already been echoed by the reports he read from the database.
Still, there was a huge difference between reading about the problems from a dry and succinct document compared to hearing it from a mech pilot who had to deal with the consequences on a day-to-day basis.
Chandis probably knew about some of the concerns that played in the background, but he made a persuasive case anyway, largely by employing his emotions.
"Too many comrades have died from this inadequate piece of dung!" Chandis kicked at the plating of the mech. Despite being relatively thin in the scale of mechs, a human foot could never leave a mark on its surface. "Look, just tell your bosses to invest some more money into quality mechs. These Inheritors aren’t worth the materials they’re built from!"
"It’s actually the opposite." Chief Carmon remarked from the side. She maintained her jaded expression throughout the lieutenant’s tirade. "The Inheritor is doing a great job in maximizing the strengths of its materials. The only problem with this approach is that there’s a limit on how much we can optimize their strengths and create more synergies."
In other words, it was as as if the Vandals sculpted a miniature mech out of sand. No matter how exquisite they carved the model of a mech, one good kick could effortlessly blow it away.
Fiddling with the shape and dimensions of the sand model only affected its structural integrity by a minor degree. Such changes would never be able to provide a comprehensive boost in survivability.
The only way to do so was to carve the miniature mech model out of a stronger material such as stone or wood.
However, doing so demanded more money and effort from the Vandals. Ves had read the internal documents on the Inheritor, and in one of them Professor Velten brutally calculated the cost efficiency of switching the Inheritor’s material composition to a stronger mix.
She concluded that increasing the costs by fifty percent would only raise the overall longevity of any random Inheritor mech by twenty-nine percent or so.
To Ves, that sounded very normal. Only at the lowest end of the mech design spectrum would the level of improvement be proportional to the increase in material costs. After that, the law of diminishing returns came into effect. Improvements became increasingly harder to achieve without spending a fortune.
In practical terms, an absolutely trashy mech that cost 3 million credits in raw materials to produce could be twice as good if the cost of materials was 6 million credits instead.
However, if a mech that cost 45 million credits got overhauled with materials that cost 90 million credits, the actual rate of improvement might only be around 10-35 percent. The range was rather large because it heavily depended on the skill and vision of the mech designer.
However, the point was clear. Every mech outfit or mech regiment needed to find a balance between their income and expenditures. Spending lots of money and resources on expensive mechs might sound good, as they often lasted longer on the battlefield, it might not be able to make up for the huge upfront costs.
The calculus that Professor Velten performed had led the 6th Flagrant Vandals maintain the current design of the Inheritor in its current state. Regardless of its performance, it was easy to fabricate from cheap exotics that were abundantly available from the market and lots of mundane materials that could be mined from practically any asteroid in any desolate star system.
Ves estimated the market price for the Inheritor at around twenty million credits. This didn’t sound so bad. The Vandals basically substituted the role of frontline mechs to the Inheritor.
Yet no one ever complained about frontline mechs. In exchange for chopping offs some limbs or even the heads of these mechs, they piled up on lots of cheap armor and slapped some gun barrels on it to make them effective at range. Although the abundance of armor didn’t protect the mech all that well and slowed it down for quite a bit, as long as they stayed at range, the mechs would not be exposed to too much risk.
It was different for the Inheritor. The only thing it had going for was speed and acceleration. Besides that, it possessed no range at all, forcing the mech to close in to knife fighting distance in each engagement. The Vandals needed to commit the Inheritors in a single go, which was very risky as complications constantly happened on the battlefield.
All of these concerns passed through his mind in an instant. While Ves sympathised with Lieutenant Chandis and his men, Ves too needed to think about the big picture. The big shots evidently decided that they would rather sustain more losses in mechs and lives than to invest in upgrading the much-maligned design.
"I will see what I can do, lieutenant." Ves answered vaguely when Chandis expected a response from him. "Your concerns are being noted."
He felt like this liaison gig wasn’t as important as he hoped. Sure, he got to see more of the Vandals, but if he constantly ended up in situations like this where he wouldn’t be able to make people’s problems go away, then it was difficult for him to feel happy about it. The Inheritor design was a light skirmisher that was built to be cheap. Ves could find no leeway in meeting any of the demands set by Chandis.
Nevertheless, he dutifully toured around the hangar while Chief Carmon showed him around the place. Ves spoke with a few other mech pilots and heard the same complaints. This time, he changed up the conversation a little. He heard more than enough bad things about the Inheritor. He wanted to know what made this design so important to the Vandals.
"Well, I gotta admit one thing about this mech." The mech pilot explained as he stood in a straight posture in front of his mech. "It teaches you how to pilot a melee mech in space. There’s no substitute to actual battle experience. No matter how much we trained in the academy and during boot camp, there’s always the realization that whatever simulations we are in is fake. Only with our backs against the wall will we be able to see if we measure up as a Vandal."
Ves thought that these words carried a lot of weight in the Vandals. Even though he hadn’t spent too much time with the mech pilots, he spotted a subtle but pervasive division between mech pilots who used the Inheritor to those who used the other models.
The were rookies.
They mostly consisted of inexperienced mech pilots who had been banished to the Vandals for some reason or another. Piloting this death trap of a mech seemed like a reckless and wasteful decision as it played fast and loose with their lives, but the incredible amount of pressure they endured also seemed to polish off their rough edges.
Those that had spent a longer time with the Inheritor behaved more mature in front of Ves, while those who only transferred in a couple of months ago still exhibited problematic behavior.
One guy happened to be extremely aggressive.
"Piss off!" A man younger than Ves snarled when they approached. "I don’t want to talk to stupid techies like you!"
Ves frowned. "I’m here to ask some questions. What is your problem?"
That really riled the mech pilot up. He jumped to his feet and approached them with his fists. "My problem is that I don’t like your face!"
Before Ves could do anything, Chief Carmon moved with confident ease and thunked the man onto his butt with the swing of her multitool.
"Knock it off, brat! We don’t tolerate roughhousing like this around here!"
The casual way in which Chief Harmon dealt with the aggressive mech pilot spoke volumes to Ves. He got the sense that outbreaks like this happened plenty of times as mech pilots unwillingly transferred into the Vandals.
While Ves wasn’t in the mood to talk to a mech pilot who wanted to punch him in the face, he had a duty to fulfill. He put down his animosity and asked his perfunctory questions.
"What do you think about the Inheritor design?"
"It’s dangerous. Spaceborn mech battles may revolve around speed, but there are many instances where you can’t dodge everything that comes in your way. This stupid mech completely ignores that possibility. Do you know how this model got its name?"
"No. Do tell, please."
"Word around here is they’re called that way because their designers hope the mechs last long enough to be inherited by my children. Hahaha! As if they will last more than a year during wartime!"
Ves didn’t know if this was true, but he doubted it. Up close to several Inheritor mechs, Ves could feel the intangible echoes embedded into the frames. These mechs had been designed from the onset to be disposable products.
Of course, they should last long enough to provide enough of a return on investment to the Vandals, but beyond that nobody cared if they got wrecked.
The Vandals would mourn if a single Hellcat got destroyed. Partially due to the enormous cost in fabricating a copy, but also due to its symbolic value.
In comparison, the Vandals wouldn’t blink at all if they lost ten Inheritor mechs in a single fight. That was just the cost of doing business. As long as the Vandals got more in return, the damage was negligible.
Evidently, this newcomer knew this and vented out his frustrations. "They sent me out to die here! I’m a medium mech pilot. There’s no way I can master a light mech so quickly! They purposely put me here to kill me."
Chief Carmon couldn’t restrain from whacking the mech pilot over the head with a light tap of her tool. "Nonsense! Larkinson, don’t listen to this lad. He’s just angry at himself for screwing up at his old posting. There’s no way we would drive our own mech pilots into a corner."
That was true, in general. A mech pilot that loosened his restraints could be a very dangerous person. The amount of damage he could inflict when he stepped inside a mech was gigantic.
Ves actually expected the Vandals to deal with this problem already, but they let the crew and mech pilots talk smack all day. It was as if they didn’t care.
Maybe the young man’s words hid a kernel of truth. Did the Vandals accept every type of person the Mech Corps threw at them with open arms? With the wild personalities these troublemakers possessed, not everyone would mellow out during their stay here.
Ves felt obliged to speak some words of defense. "This isn’t the best mech model that came into existence, but let’s not exaggerate things here. As long as you aren’t too unlucky, you’ll be able to survive inside the cockpit of an Inheritor."
Talking with the mech pilots left him with a whole bunch of negative opinions to sort through. Ves didn’t leave it at that and also began to question the various mech technicians in charge of defending the factory ship.
One of them was an older man, and he used to be a mech designer in his early years of adulthood. He hadn’t been able to make it on his own, so he tried to find some meaning in his life by serving in the Mech Corps.
Someone with a background in mech design possessed a lot more insights on the nuances of a design than outsiders. "The Inheritor is not a difficult design to maintain. It’s actually very ease. There’s one downside to this mech that I’m a little more dubious about."
"What is that?" Ves said as he leaned in.
"The Inheritor seems like a derivative of a better design. A greater design. Perhaps even an elite one."
The old mech technician’s claim sounded very absurd to Ves. Perhaps the reason why this fellow hadn’t made it as a mech designer was because he constantly came to weird conclusions like this. How could a design of a disposable mech like the Inheritor be a variant of a high-end mech design?
Ves turned to Chief Carmon. "Have you ever seen a superior version of the Inheritor?"
"Not even close." The chief shook her head. "I’ve been a Vandal for over twenty years and been posted on more than eight different carriers and I’ve never seen any other version of the Inheritor than the one we’re currently looking at. I know this model like the back of my hand and there’s no tolerance for improvement besides using better materials."
That caused Ves to look at the frame of the Inheritor in a different way. The design might not be all that good, but what would happen if he replaced the low-quality materials with better ones.
He performed a brief visualisation of the result. His conclusions led to the a similar route to the road that his Crystal Lord design had taken.
"What is the Inheritor design is clad in compressed armor?" He asked. "The main advantage of the Inheritor is that it’s fast even for a spaceborn light skirmisher. The downside to that is that its armor is extremely flimsy. Replacing its lightweight armor with compressed armor plating will substantially negate this disadvantage."
"That’s exactly right." The former mech designer said. "You can also replace the core parts with better versions."
It would be a completely different design. The performance of such a machine would be a multitude of times more effective than the cheap hunk of alloys the Vandals relied on as one of its workhorse models.
Yet none of it mattered.
"This design you’re describing doesn’t exist." Ves said. "Not if what Chief Carmon said is true. It might be that the original designer had a quality mech design in mind when he originally developed a premium mech, but he never made it into fruition. Afterwards, when the Vandals commissioned him to design an affordable light skirmisher for space battles, he must have recycled some of his old work."
Every mech designer created more designs than they could put to use. They usually archived their unused designs and utilized some of its elements in other projects to cut save a lot of time and effort.
The more Ves thought about it, the more this conclusion resonated to him. Maybe that was why the Inheritor was a little unsuited in its role as a disposable mech.
"It sounds possible, but without any proof, we’re guessing in the wind. Besides, even if it turns out to be true, that doesn’t make this model any better."
Ves wanted to get the conversation back on track. He steered the conversation away from baseless speculation and turned back to his original job of gathering feedback on the Inheritor mech.
He didn’t learn much new after talking with all of the mech technicians. Sometimes, they described some problems concerning the difficulty in assembling or repairing certain sections, but fixing those issues required a lot of time and didn’t measurably strengthen the mechs at all.
Still, in the back of his mind, Ves could fathom the reason why the Vandals possibly utilized a heavily downgraded version of an excellent design. It made no sense. Someone as skilled as Professor Velten or any of the Senior Mech Designers that used to work for the Vandals should have been able to design an optimal spaceborn light skirmisher from the ground up.
Ves left that question to the side and concentrated on his work. He also didn’t forget about observing his surroundings. He hadn’t forgotten his earlier desires to figure out what made the Vandals tick.
At the end of the day, Ves returned to his cabin and summed up the feedback he received in a bland report. Ves didn’t focus too much about what he put into words because they mainly echoed all of the existing problems known by the design department.
Instead, he focused on his other observations.
The main takeaway from his walk around the ship was that the Vandals acted with less discipline than they should have behaved, but they made up for it in their sense of unity and their trust in their leadership.
Besides the malcontents who piloted the Inheritor, everyone else displayed no displeasure at being assigned to one of the least desirable mech regiments of the Mech Corps.
"The Vandals maintain a true esprit de corps."
This identity that set them apart from everyone else lifted their hearts and gave them strength. Ves had seen similar beliefs in outfits like Walter’s Whalers. Their esprit de corps arguably made them fifty percent stronger, if only because they wouldn’t cut and run at the first sign of trouble.
This strong collective belief made it even stranger that it did not extend to the pilots of the Inheritor mechs. Their relationship to the Vandals was akin to the status of Pierce and Laida in their design teams. As temporary workers, they would only stay for a stint or two before being assigned somewhere else.
The difference between the two situations was that mech designers transferred away in peace, while the mech pilots most often had had to pay for their lives.
The possible kept nagging at Ves to he called to Laida for them to meet at the canteen.
When he arrived at the place, he ordered a quick coffee and some snacks and sat down on the opposite of Laida. The young woman looked tired.
"Did I call you up when you were about to go to bed?"
"Yes."
"I’m sorry about that." Ves sheepishly scratched his head. "I didn’t think about the time."
"It’s fine. You wanted to talk about the Inheritor, right? I’ve been having many restless nights due to this design. It doesn’t make sense."
Laida spoke about some of her issues. Different from what the mech pilots brought up, she addressed more technical issues.
"The root of the problem lies in the demand that the Inheritor has to meet a standard in terms of speed and acceleration. This is forcing us to design the Inheritor as lopsided as possible to accommodate these wishes. It’s the entire reason why its flight system is rather overpowered for a design of that stature, and why we don’t have any weight capacity left to thicken its armor. They’re asking us to do the impossible, so we only delivered half of what was promised and forgot about the other half."
"So you believe it’s not a deliberate choice to make the Inheritor so fragile?"
"Not really." Laida replied after a momentary pause. "It’s due to helplessness from our design team, mostly. Did you know that in the last twelve months, we’ve only been able to increase the durability of the Inheritor by two percent? That’s miniscule!"
A two percent increase in durability without resorting to more expensive materials was an impressive achievement depending on the starting point of the design in question.
Increasing the toughness of a heavy mech by two percent meant that it could withstand a lot more firepower in absolute terms.
Increasing the toughness of a thin light mech by the same proportion hardly made no difference at all. It wouldn’t even let the mech endure one additional ballistic rifle shell.
So the progress the Inheritor design team had made over the past year really amounted to squat. "Has all of the potential in this design been exhausted?"
"As I said, it’s mainly because of orders from the top that we can’t improve this design. If you ask my entire design team, they’ll say that the Vandals should have switched over to a different design a long time ago."
As Ves discussed the issues of the Inheritor design a little more, Ves increasingly got the suspicion that the Inheritor was indeed derived from a better design. Ves still didn’t know the reason why, but he increasingly believed that this was a deliberate choice from Colonel Lowenfield or Professor Velten.
There was something more a stake behind this seemingly inane choice to stick with the Inheritor design.
After finishing the meeting and letting Laida return to bed, Ves retired for the night and returned to work the next day. His new assignment didn’t entail documenting the same old complaints by the mech pilots. The professor tasked him with coming up with concrete improvements in the designs the Vandals developed on their own with the help of his unique strengths.
Ves had no clue how to do this after hearing about the awful state of the Inheritor.
"The Hellcat and Akkara designs are a mess, but at least they have a lot of room to improve. The same can’t be said about this stupid piece of junk."
As Ves made his rounds to the other hangars of the Wolf Mother, he heard the same things over and over again. It really made him question Lowenfield and Velten’s sanity for persisting with this inadequate design.
Not that any other light skirmisher would do much better, but with a minor bump in cost, the longevity of the mech would increase by a significant amount. Ves found it strange that the Vandals refused to accept this generous trade-off. After all, the law of diminishing returns didn’t bite so hard at the start of the curve.
While his prospects of coming up with effective solutions diminished, he at least tried to do his best. Ves particularly took advantage of his freedom of movement to stroll through as many ship compartments as possible as he passed from hangar to hangar. He got to see how every other section of the factory ship looked like and how many people worked to keep the mech regiment running.
It humbled him in a way. He passed by a lot of enormous machines the size of a couple of mechs jumbled together. The scale of these machines caused him to fall into an illusion that it wasn’t the Vandals driving the Wolf Mother, but it was the Wolf Mother dictating the actions of the Vandals.
Ves shook his head. "What kind of nonsense is that?!"
He quickly turned back to his work. As Ves met with many mech pilots and mech technicians and personally performed a deep inspection of a disassembled Inheritor mech, Ves continued to perceive the intangible qualities of the Inheritor.
"Too bad it’s hardly there."
These mechs had never been truly valued since their conception. Their designers intended for them to last a couple of years at most, while the Vandals obviously didn’t take any special care of them despite fielding them by the hundreds.
This led to the formation of dead or stunted spiritual existences within the mechs. With hardly anyone showing any care for these mechs, it was no surprise that they couldn’t fully mesh with their mech pilots.
Most of the mech pilots Ves had questioned described the piloting experience in awful terms. One mech pilot described it as landing on a bed of nails, trying to flail your limbs in order get out, only to suffer more injuries as a result.
"Maybe that description is a little too extreme."
After experiencing so many Inheritors through sight and touch, Ves realized its design failed to live up to its promises due to a common thread.
The Inheritor was unloved.
Seemingly no one appreciated this design. Its designers regarded it as a throwaway mech. The technicians who fabricated it en masse tried to rush the work as fast as possible. The mech pilots who had been assigned to pilot these death traps all hated spending one more second in its cockpit than was necessary.
Ves honed in on this observation and thought that this might be the opening he was looking for. Could he turn this difficult and unloved design into something that people could be proud of working with?
No one appreciated a light mech except for light mech enthusiasts. It took a special kind of mech pilot to truly enjoy the rush of speed, even if it meant sacrificing a lot of personal protection.
The reason why Ves stuck to a medium weight class for his Crystal Lord design was because he did not wish to narrow its potential audience any further. An overly narrow mech design might not face much competition in its niche, but it would also be destined to obscurity.
The main issue at play with the light skirmisher archetype was that its effectiveness drastically different on land, air and space.
Light melee mechs saw the most use in landbound mech combat. Combat took place in smaller areas and mechs on land moved slower and their weapons exhibited many restrictions in range. This allowed light mechs to approach their landbound prey with ease by taking advantage of the natural cover of the terrain.
Spaceborn combat stripped most of those advantages. Terrain on land was often complex, while space was literally and empty void. Light mechs would be as bare as as they were born if they flew through this completely open space as they approached their targets.
The effectiveness of this mode of combat could be imagined.
Granted, many battles in space occurred in slightly more complex environment. Only rarely would two enemy forces meet in the middle of empty space. Most of the time, a mobile force attacked a static position, such as a mine or a space station. These fixed features afforded light mechs with sparse but effective cover.
Nevertheless, it would usually be the defenders taking advantage of available cover. This protected them from ranged fire and forced the attacking force to enter their kill zones.
Reading through the summaries of the various battles the 6th Flagrant Vandals had fought, most Inheritors met their end in this way. "Shot down in the process of closing the distance."
It was an ignoble end to any mech. Sometimes, the Vandals were obligated to attack a well-defended position. They possessed a number of knights that could absorb a decent amount of blows, the Hellcat being the most prominent one, but a charge needed to be supplemented by as many mech frames as possible in order to spread the incoming fire.
In these cases, the mech commander in charge of the assault would always accompany the knights with a horde of Inheritors. Despite being one of the most fragile punching bags in space, the Vandals evidently had no qualms in employing them as cannon fodder.
When Ves met with Laida again during lunch and told her his conclusions, she shook her head in sadness.
"It’s horrendous." She spoke with a whisper. "The longer I stay in the Inheritor design team, the more I realize that none of them care. The only mech designer who still cares a bit is the temp from Rittersberg and myself, but we are growing number every day. It’s hard to prioritize decency when we are faced with constant demands to increase its cost-effectiveness."
"I thought your design team isn’t making much progress these past few years."
"That’s not exactly right. It’s true that we haven’t been able to increase the Inheritor’s performance parameters, but we did manage to shave off ten percent of its manufacturing cost in that time. Most of our efforts are spent on achieving as much cost savings as possible as opposed to actually improving the design in battle."
That sounded really crazy to Ves. The Vandals spent an enormous amount of money and resources keeping everything running. He could certainly understand if they needed to be frugal with their spending, but cheapening an already barebone mech design even further was basically starving their own hunting dogs.
"That sounds like your design team is trying to creatively cut as much corners as possible. There’s no way the structural integrity of the Inheritor design can be maintained."
Laida nodded grimly. "It’s a tradeoff. If you can reduce the cost of the frame by one percent by substituting one material for another, you would accept it as long as it won’t weaken the mech too much. In this case, as long as the mech won’t weaken more than a tenth of a percent, the design team will accept the change with open arms."
In other words, the Inheritor design had most likely weakened over time. A performance decrease of a tenth of a percent didn’t sound so bad, but its design team constantly applied new solutions.
A tenth of a percent turned into a half percent. A half percent turned into one percent. One percent turned into two percent.
This slide in performance didn’t happen fast enough for the mech pilots to notice, but that didn’t mean it was negligible. The effectiveness of the Inheritors would continue to decline and their mech pilots risked dying even faster.
The Vandals was like an abusive parent to the Inheritor design. Even as they made use of it, they constantly talked it down or starved it in order to save on costs.
Although Ves did not understand the priorities of the higher ups, he believed that their entire approach to the Inheritor design should be upended from the ground up. Rather than approach it from a perspective of reducing its burdens, they should instead seek to increase its value.
When Ves laid out his suggestion to Laida, she did not seem very hopeful at his suggestion.
"The Inheritor design doesn’t have much of a future in my eyes. All the low-hanging fruit has been plucked, so it’s nearly impossible to increase its parameters without increasing its cost or adding more weight and space."
"I think a change in perspective is still necessary. Your design team has been seeking ways to cut its cost for so long that they forgot to do anything else. If it were up to me, I would have expanded the cost allowance by five percent or so in order to get them to start thinking into the other direction again."
Laida remained skeptical. She believed that the Vandals couldn’t be shaken out of their established impressions of the Inheritor design.
Ves wasn’t willing to settle this issue like that. So when he returned to his office, he compiled a report and sent it to Professor Velten. He also scheduled a meeting with her in order to explain his thoughts in person.
He got to meet her later in the day. As he entered her office and sat down on the other side of the desk, he looked at Velten and tried to figure out if most of the demands on the Inheritor had been imposed by the Senior Mech Designer.
Though she looked like an old lady and her mind wasn’t as agile as before, she still radiated a faint sensation of solidity. It was as if Ves faced a slab of compressed armor instead of a fragile human being.
The Senior Mech Designer took no note of Ves when he entered. Instead, she fixated her attention on an unknown component design projected from her desk terminal.
Ves curiously glanced at the part and tried to figure out what it did. It did not resemble any of the standard mech parts such as an engine or power reactor. His long-buried Signals and Communications Skill started to rouse itself from its sleep after he tentatively identified some sub-components that had to do with sending and receiving signals.
If he had to make a guess, Professor Velten was working on a supersized transceiver customized for a very specific design. At this power and size, the transceiver should have no problem communicating through long distances and strong jamming.
He guessed that Velten was preparing this transceiver for the upcoming grand raid on the Imodris Duchy.
"Ah. Mr. Larkinson. You are here now. Good." She spoke as her head abruptly shifted upwards. She waved a hand which winked the projection out. "I have been anxiously waiting for you to report back on your progress. To my surprise, after an entire week, the only points of note in your reports are rehashes of old problems and a rather ludicrous suggestion that we should shift our paradigms concerning the Inheritor design."
Though she sounded harsh in her judgement of his work, Ves did not immediately concede. He did not wish for his report to be filed away and forgotten by all. He strongly believed that the problems he documented and the solutions he proposed would measurably strengthen the Vandals.
"Professor, forgive me for being somewhat blunt, but the Inheritor mech has long been stagnant as an actively developed design. Hardly anything improved except for its cost efficiency, and you know as well as I do that these cost savings came at a cost. The war we are waging against the Vesia Kingdom won’t end until a few years later. If the Flagrant Vandals intend to depend on the Inheritor design to carry them through the next five years, they should invest in making it stronger, not weakening it any further."
The professor looked at Ves with a small frown. She tutted at Ves and knocked her desk with a finger. "Let me ask you something. Do you know how much credits it takes to support an entire mech regiment?"
"I’m sorry, ma’am. I don’t have a clue."
"There are many costs associated with running a force of over two-thousand mechs and all the logistics necessary to maintain them and to convey them across the stars. Fuel, salary, maintenance, replacements and more all form a persistent drain on our finances."
"Yet the Hellcat and Akkara designs are both expensive and extravagant in terms of features. From my time in the Hellcat design team, I’ve noticed that everyone is constantly working on squeezing out more performance out of the hybrid knight. They might not always succeed, but they always strove to climb the stairs. It’s entirely different for the Inheritor. Everyone is walking backwards, going lower and lower until eventually they reach the ground."
The analogy succinctly illustrated his point. Ves just hoped that Professor Velten would be swayed by his argument.
Unfortunately, her face remained impassive. "The Hellcat and Akkara designs fulfill a very different role in our mech lineup. These mechs carry a substantial amount of armor and their longevity is great."
In other words, even the professor treated the Inheritor like dog poop.
"I think it’s a disservice to the Inheritor design if we think of it as a burden." Ves emphasized. "I am aware of the costs involved with improving the quality of this design, but I really think it is necessary to do so, ma’am. Just give it a chance."
"No."
"Uhm, pardon me?"
"Nothing of the sort will be done." Velten spoke with finality. "Though I can see the merits in your unique perspective, that doesn’t outweigh the priorities of the Vandals and the mech Corps. There is no leeway in this matter."
Ves continued his attempts at persuasion, but got rebuffed by the professor each time. He started to believe that Velten did not hold any decision-making power on this matter. She never relented on the expectations she had set on the designs she surpervised.
The issue ended without any changes to the policies set by the Vandals. Ves was deeply disappointed at this outcome. It made him feel as if he wasted the entire week.
"Perhaps it is a mistake to assign the Inheritor under your supervision. It is a very complex design that is bound to many goals." She thought of something else. "Perhaps you could need a break. It just so happens to be that we will soon be transitioning out of FTL to meet with a delegation of the Vesian Revolutionary Front. One of the terms of our deal with them is that they commit their own mechs to our forces. I’d like you to join Alloc as he studies their designs."
His eyes began to shine. "I’ll do my best, ma’am."
After wasting his time on the Inheritor, Ves deeply wished to experience something else. Meeting the Vesians and studying their mechs up close sounded just the right kind of thing to distract him from his failures.
He also wanted to see for himself how chummy the Flagrant Vandals and the Vesians rebels acted in each other’s presence. Did they consider their cooperation a necessary evil, or was there something more behind this scheme?
"Have you met with these Vesians before, sir?" Ves asked as innociously as possible as he adjusted his formal burgundy uniform.
The 6th Flagrant Vandals regimental colors consisted of wine-red and black, though they mostly wore black uniforms in their day-to-day duties. The formal uniform that Ves just received would only be worn in their first meeting with the rebel delegation. After all the of the pomp and ceremony scheduled for today had passed, Ves would return to his standard dark green working uniform.
"We’ve had dealings with the VRF before. A lot of Vesian rebel movements are localized on a single planet. The bigger players only span the range of a single duchy at most. Culture and customs differ a lot between different duchies, so it’s hard for these rebel groups to find any common ground with each other. The Vesian Revolutionary Front is one of the few exceptions to this rule."
"Are they the most powerful rebel group in Vesian space?"
"They’re not. In fact, groups that span a single duchy can easily mobilize ten times as much mechs and sympathisers than a broader movement like the VRF. They’re too bland and distant in the eyes of the rebels on the ground."
"Then what makes them so valuable to us that we have to greet them with a formal ceremony, sir?" Ves asked with puzzlement in his voice.
"Just because the different rebel movements don’t agree on many matters doesn’t mean that they ignore each other. Sometimes, they want to trade a resource their duchy has in abundance with another resource that can’t be sourced from the same region. To facilitate this kind of trade in a completely lawless undergrounding setting, a trustworthy intermediary is needed."
Ves got it now. "Ah, so the VRF have profiled themselves as bridge builders that can connect different groups together, but only to the extent they are comfortable with. I imagine one of the reasons why they can engender trust is because they aren’t big enough to threaten the position of these regional rebel movements."
"Exactly so." Alloc nodded as they began to move through the corridors. "Regional rivalries exist in any states, but it’s magnified to an extreme extent in the Vesia Kingdom. Nobles fight against nobles and it’s not unheard of for the rebels that exist to overthrow them to get into feuds as well. It’s like internal conflict is baked inside their DNA."
That only made it more admirable for the VRF to stay above the infighting. "So if they aren’t very strong, why are they sending their own mechs to us?"
"It’s one of the demands that Colonel Lowenfield has set. Though we’ve always cooperated with each other without issue, there’s always the possibility that they might stab us in the back. Hosting some of their assets aboard our ships will guarantee us against betrayal."
"So they are hostages?"
"You can look at them in that way, yes, but they are our guests as well. We’ve done well with the help of the FRF so it’s important to treat them cordially at all times. They’ll mostly stick to themselves so you won’t have to be afraid of starting any incidents with them. Just don’t ask them why they joined the VRF. The reasons are often traumatic."
The pair of mech designers in burgundy spent a few more minutes traversing the corridors in silence. Due to the size of the Wolf Mother, it would take them at least fifteen minutes to arrive at their destination on foot.
A proper capital ship incorporated several aids to get people to their destination faster, such as internal trains or lifter platforms. Unfortunately, the Wolf Mother’s ad-hoc expansion hadn’t taken these conveniences into account, and employing devices like lifter platforms posed a potential security risk.
Thus, Ves and Alloc had no choice but to trudge their way down the decks and towards the sides of the Wolf Mother. Walking through her cavernous depths gave Ves the illusion that he was descending into the belly of the beast.
"How are you holding up in your new assignment, Ves?" Alloc asked.
"Not very good." He replied honestly. "I haven’t been off to a good start. Try telling Professor Velten that the development on the Inheritor design needs to undergo a U-turn."
The Journeyman Mech Designer chuckled. "I can imagine why you would suggest that. It’s not the first time such a suggestion has been bandied about."
"If the same suggestion has come up before, why is no one taking it seriously?"
Alloc sighed. "Because it’s about money."
"Everyone always tells me that the Vandals are short on money, but how could they? They have the Wolf Mother! That’s a portable mineral processor and mech factory! They can easily generate a lot of income by fabricating and selling a lot of mechs."
"It’s not so simple." Alloc shook his head. "First, the Mech Corps isn’t allowed to enter the private market. It would open up a lot of can of worms if economic interests started to interfere with purely military interests. Second, let me fill you in on a secret."
What secret did he refer to?
Alloc leaned close to Ves and whispered something in his ear.
"The 6th Flagrant Vandals is heavily indebted. I don’t have an exact figure, but my estimates is that the Vandals owe around 200 to 400 billion bright credits."
Ves almost tripped when he heard that enormous sum. "Billions, sir? Not millions?"
"I didn’t misspeak. It’s billions of bright credits. Yet that’s not the most frightening thing. The question you should be asking is who the Vandals borrowed the money from. I can tell you one thing. It’s not the Mech Corps. They wanted to cut off the funding for the Vandals in the first place, so there’s no way they’ll even consider extending loans to us."
All of this information caused him to remain off-balance. What was wrong with the Vandals? Was a mech regiment of the Mech Corps even allowed to take out a loan?
"Sir. Are the Vandals still leaking out money?"
"Yep. It’s a waterfall. Even after we got rid of our fleet carrier and built up the Wolf Mother, we still can’t break even. You have to realize that raiding Vesian space isn’t actually profitable for a mech regiment of our scale. Pirates don’t suffer the same problem because they’re mostly running a handful of ramshackle ships and crumbling mechs. They hardly spend anything to keep themselves afloat. It’s different for us because we’re bigger and we have quality standards."
"Even if the Vandals are heavily indebted, slimming down the Inheritor won’t necessary save a lot of money. I would argue that it actually increases the costs, since they get wrecked so often."
"Professor Velten doesn’t think so. As I mentioned before, she has performed a whole raft of calculations that sets the Inheritor’s current cost picture as its most cost effective position. The mech is strong enough to last a while but cheap enough that it won’t hurt that much if we need to replace a copy or two."
"Still, the Vandals would only save a hundred million credits or so over an entire year. The costs savings doesn’t seem to be worth it if it keeps weakening the design, sir."
"Just because the Vandals have accumulated a mountain of debt doesn’t mean we are eager to raise it even higher. The main reason why we haven’t been able to break even is because there’s hardly any profit to be made in times of peace. If the war hadn’t erupted by this time, the Vandals would have truly been forced to disband."
Ves looked at Alloc with an amazed expression. "Does that mean this upcoming raid is motivated by money?"
"Exactly." Alloc replied softly. He leaned in again to whisper something else. "I can’t tell you our target, but you can bet it’s a highly-populated star system that holds a lot of advanced industries. As long as we can rob it blind, we can take a huge chunk out of our debt off the table."
What Alloc revealed to Ves was a revelation. He hadn’t fully appreciated how bad their financial situation affected their daily operations. Even as they showed off a lot of outward strengths, internally they barely made ends meet."
It became clear to him that the Vandals stakes a lot more than he thought on the upcoming raid. The outcome of this ambitious operation might very well decide whether the 6th Flagrant Vandals remained afloat or be swept away in the annals of history.
They finally reached their destination after another bout of silence. Heavily armored security officers dressed in dress garb or fully-enclosed exoskeleton suits checked them for any threats.
After confirming security that they were harmless, Alloc and Ves went through the armored hatch and entered into the largest hangar of the Wolf Mother. They joined a group of neatly-dressed servicemen standing in rows.
They didn’t have to wait for long for their guests to arrive. A dozen mechs along with two sturdy military-grade shuttles flowed in from the hangar doors. They carefully settled down in the hangar set aside for them. The Vandal mechs that used to occupy this space had been transferred to another ship in the fleet.
They settled down one by one according to invisible instructions. The mechs arrived with their weapons bearing obvious seals, not that it would stop them from accelerating into the waiting crowd and stomping them all to muddy bits with their feet. That was why the really important Vandals such as Professor Velten or Colonel Lowenfield had been left out of the greeting party.
Instead, some captain Ves had never seen before led the delegation from the Vandals.
A few minutes later, the shuttles opened their hatches. A handful of formally but soberly dressed men and women emerged out of the Vesian shuttles, accompanied by a small host of lightly armored guards.
The makeup of the Vesians largely matched the delegation from the Vandals, only with much less people. It was as if both sides had agreed to send somewhat important people but not the truly indispensable ones from their organisations.
To Ves, such hedging defeated the purpose of taking hostages. Would the VRF truly care if the Vandals pulled out their guns and shot the Vesians dead before they could utter a word of protest?
"Mr. Meffeth!"
"Ah, captain, it is good to see you again!" A jolly-looking fellow greeted their captain with a bear hug. "It is my pleasure to be aboard your fantastic factory ship again."
Mr. Meffeth smiled and glanced at the rest of the welcoming party as some musicians started to play a martial tune. "Very uplifting. I hope to see our latest cooperation to proceed in the same vein."
The captain laughed and pulled Mr. Meffeth by the shoulders. "With the help of your connections, I’m sure we’ll both profit handsomely."
Ves listened carefully as the two leaders spoke about matters beyond what he should know. They never went into specifics, probably due to how many people had gathered here, but what little they revealed was very valuable in confirming what he had guessed beforehand.
Even as his ears stayed open to pick up the useful facts from the litany of empty platitudes, he scanned his eyes over the other Vesians who came out of the shuttles.
The majority consisted of friendly-looking men and women in their forties or fifties. Despite their drab uniforms, their posture and composure reminded Ves of diplomats or traders rather than partisans who eked out a marginal existence. They must be earning well for themselves as a mediator between different rebel movements.
Only a handful of Vesians carried themselves differently. Besides the guards and the obvious military types, the Vesians brought three people who all carried themselves in the same manner as Alloc and Ves.
The Vesians brought their own mech designers. And they all happened to be women as well. One older woman stood over a pair of curious-looking young women. The matron must be a Journeymen while the younger women must be Apprentices.
All three happened to be pretty as well in different ways.
The welcoming party held a banquet for the visiting representatives. Though the Vesian Revolutionary Front ostensibly resisted against aristocracy and the excesses associated with them, they weren’t strangers to the finer things in life.
The Flagrant Vandals pulled out a lot of stops to impress the newcomers. The dining hall was situated at the top decks that encompassed a massive transparent dome from above. Ves saw unknown stars and unknown ships orbiting around the Wolf Mother. He also spotted the red dwarf, but couldn’t determine where they were in Vesian space.
"To my friend, let us toast!"
"Haha!" Mr. Meffeth blustered. "You always bring the finest wines from Rittersberg!"
For a mech regiment deep in debt, they sure held little back for this occasion. Ves recognized several exclusive dishes that must have cost a lot of credits to acquire. The cloud rice from Cloudy Curtain, the luminescent blue mushrooms from Bentheim, the finest red wines from Rittersberg and the aeliotonoc whale meat imported from Moira’s Paradise served to everyone present could have afforded half an Inheritor mech.
The sheer amount of waste really boggled his mind. Though Ves lived a lot easier when he started earning loads of money, he didn’t spend his money on frivolous and temporal luxuries such as good food and wine. He was way too busy to slow down and appreciate the finer things in life. Ves regularly ate simple meals reconstituted out of cheap nutrient packs.
"Alloc, who is this young gentleman over here?" The mature-looking woman asked as she daintily played with her salad.
"This is Ves Larkinson, an Apprentice who has just arrived at the Vandals a couple of months ago. He’s very bright and has unique talents."
"Unique you say?" Florissa Minyn drawled out as she twirled a finger. Her eyes glazed over to Ves and he could feel the curiosity bursting out from them. "Are you talented in many areas?"
Ves awkwardly smiled. "Alloc is exaggerating. I’ve only entered the industry for a few years."
"Ves doesn’t have much practical experience, but he’s good with theory and he has a special touch for improving the piloting experience. His customers back home are rabid fans of his work!"
That caused the other two girls to glance over in his direction. A blonde who introduced herself a little earlier as Iris Jupiter asked another question.
"So you’re an entrepreneur in the Bright Republic? How many mechs have you sold?"
"I don’t keep track of the exact figure. If I include the sale of mechs from third-party manufacturers that have licensed my design, then it should be around three-thousand to five-thousand mechs I think."
If Ves only took the sales figures of the LMC into account, the number would look much less impressive.
All three women looked mildly impressed. The other girl, a raven-haired woman called Lucille Hornbach blinked at him as if he was an alien.
"That’s impressive, Mr. Larkinson! You must have earned an enormous amount of bright credits! Why are you even here?"
Florissa quickly bumped Lucille with her elbow. "That’s not very polite!"
"Sorry!"
"It’s okay, Miss Hornbach. I have nothing to hide." Ves smiled at them, even though he just said a big fat lie. "My history is a little complicated. I’m apprenticed to Master Carmin Olson. Even though I’ve only received a few pointers from her so far, it inevitably casts some doubts on me. I don’t blame the Mech Corps for pushing me away from the frontlines."
None of the Vesian mech designers cared about that. Their eyes practically sparkled as soon as he mentioned his Master.
"You’re apprenticed to Master Olson?! The genius that rose up from the Vermeer Group?!"
"Yes. That’s the one."
The two girls squealed in unison in a stupendously high pitch, causing conversation nearby to be disrupted. Florissa embarrassingly hushed the two girls and waved at everyone to turn away.
"We are not aboard our own ships anymore. Pease show some more decorum!"
"Sorry, auntie Florissa." Both girls apologized while hanging their heads in a glum manner.
Their casual attitude seemed completely unlike most mech designers he had met before. If no one told him that they knew how to design mechs, Ves would have mistaken them for teenagers barely out of school.
Both of them looked pretty and young that spoke of exquisite care in their appearances. While this was normal among the young elite, the girls behaved in a somewhat carefree manner. It made Ves a little confused. Were these people even rebels? He previously imagined the resistance members living aboard shambling starships and barely having enough funds to make ends meet.
Evidently, the delegation of the VRF showed no signs that they suffered any hardships. Mr. Meffeth spontaneously held a drinking contest with the captain from the Vandals while the three women charmingly kept the conversation with Ves and Alloc running.
They quickly moved to a first-name basis, which wasn’t unusual for someone from the Bright Republic but was highly unusual in Vesian culture.
"Florissa, how are your designs doing in the VRF lately?"
She smiled at Alloc. "I am doing very well so far. Although I have not published any new designs by myself, all of the collaborative project that I’m involved in has been spread to the entire organization."
"How big is the VRF?" Ves asked with genuine puzzlement. Sometimes, he had the sense that the VRF was a behemoth, but other times it was a medium-sized organisation that had been stretched out to cover the entire Kingdom.
"We’re not allowed to tell you the exact figures, but it’s safe to say that we can give a couple of mech divisions from the Mech Corps a run for their money."
That wasn’t enough to overthrow an established Vesian duchy, but it would certainly be able to cause mass disruption if the VRF deployed them all at once.
Naturally, Florissa could have lied about their strength. Ves thought that an all-encompassing organization like the VRF should have had a few tricks up their sleeve.
Not that it was any of his business.
"What are your specialties?"
"I am a specialist in spaceborn flight systems." Florissa answered first as she glanced at Alloc. "Part of the reason why I am transferred aboard your lovely factory ship is because your design department lacks this specialty. It’s a show of good faith on our part, and a sign of appreciation for all the assistance you have rendered us over the years."
Again, Ves received another clue on the closeness of the ties between the Vandals and the VRF.
"What about you two ladies?"
They both looked at each other for some reasons before they smiled at him. Iris spoke first. "I’m a specialist in neural interfaces, while Lucille is a heat sink specialist."
All three of them possessed an eclectic mix of very specific specialties. Two of them happened to be very relevant to the design department. As for the specialty mentioned by Iris, Ves almost had to do a double take.
"You design and customize neural interfaces?" Ves asked with more than a bit of doubt.
Messing around with neural interface was dangerous work at the best of time. Implemented incorrectly, and a mech could easily fry the brains of their mech pilots. The vast majority of mech designers utilized standard neural interface models that the MTA made available for free.
In general, there was little demand for customizing neural interfaces. Everytime someone messed with it, they risked upsetting some sort of limit and turned the neural interfaces into torture machines.
"It is a family tradition." Iris spoke proudly. "We Jupiters have worked on neural interfaces designs under the auspices of the MTA for generations. They’ve approved each product we’ve released over the years."
"Is that still going on?"
"Sadly not." She replied, seeming genuinely stricken all of a sudden. "A long time ago, we Jupiters affronted a relative of a powerful duke. The incident was small and nothing should have come out of it, but the duke himself moved to retaliate against our entire lineage. We lost everything within a matter of weeks. Our contracts turned invalid, our partners stopped supplying us, our employees left our research labs and our products got smeared on the galactic net."
Florissa sighed and pulled Iris into a hug. "What the Jupiters have suffered is something which happens all too often in a tyrannical state like the Vesia Kingdom. The nobility is always right. In a dispute between a noble and a commoner, we have as much rights as a pig reared for slaughter."
When Ves was young, he often heard tales of such abuses in school. He realized later on that the stories were meant to malign the Kingdom and made them out as a place of horror who would dearly bring their abuses over the the Republic once they conquered it. It was the duty of everyone from the Republic to resist such tyranny.
Propaganda or not, the stories always held a kernel of truth. Hearing such an example from Iris really made it clear to Ves that the lessons he learned at school hadn’t pulled those anecdotes from thin air.
"Have you adjusted yourself to living with the rebels? What is there to do with them?"
"Oh, the VRF has been good to us." Iris nodded as she wiped away her tears. "You have to know that while our rebel movement can easily get our hands on mechs from the private market, it’s difficult to hide our whereabouts. We would rather buy the raw resources from the market or the other rebel groups and fabricate our own mechs. Keeping our design and production activities in-house guarantees that the mechs don’t come with spying devices or software hacks."
"So it’s a matter of maintaining complete control over your mechs. I can understand that." Ves replied. "Do you keep all of your designs for internal use or do you also sell your mechs to other groups?"
Florissa answered this question. "We maintain a lucrative business in selling mechs to the smaller rebel groups. It’s not easy for newly established rebels to get their hands on fully functional mechs. This helps them kickstart their rebellion and allows them to cause more trouble to the nobles."
That didn’t sound very good to Ves. There was no way a small group of malcontents could threaten the rule of the established powers in the Kingdom. Ves did not ask for the outcomes of these so-called rebellions. Instead, he focused on the other aspects of their stories.
"It sounds like the VRF has taken on the role of the black market."
"That’s exactly what we are in Vesian space. As an organization that resists the tyrants who believe they have a birthright to do everything they want, we’ve suffered too many betrayals from gangs and pirates that are able to supply us of the things we needed."
"The Vesian underground scene is split into two parts." Alloc interjected. "One part consists of the regular scum of the galaxy. They don’t care about nobility and politics. They even like such a system, because nobles sometimes become their best patrons."
"Alloc is correct." Florissa nodded. "In our eyes, the noble Houses are nothing more than gangs that enjoy official sanction. The two work well together whenever their interests align. It’s not safe for rebel movements like ours to build a long-term relationship with the underground groups. The trust simply isn’t there. That is why we have built up our own underground trading network. We are one of the few middlemen that rebels across the Kingdom can trust."
Truly, the more Ves heard about the VRF, the more his impression of them veered away from a traditional rebel group like the Bentheim Liberation Movement.
Whereas the BLM lived like cornered rats that sought refuge in the deepest depths of the planets or in the most desolate corners of a lifeless star system, the VRF merrily went about earning a handsome profit from facilitating trade between different rebel groups. They sounded surprisingly mercantile for a movement that ostenably sought to overthrow the feudal order.
"How far along are rebel groups like yours to launch an uprising?" Ves pointedly asked.
All three ladies fell silent for a moment.
The oldest among them, Florissa, recovered the quickest. "The Vesian Revolutionary Front has been planning the downfall of the nobles for decades. Unlike other movements which attempt to enact an immediate change, we have been much more deliberate in our approach. As much as we think the nobles are detestable, without convincing the rest of the commoners who are ignorant of the abuses, our rebellion doesn’t stand a chance."
In other words, the VRF talked big but didn’t do much to back up their words. Ves understood their position somewhat, but these Vesian rebel movements all sounded like they enjoyed their current position a little too much.
Well, it was none of his business, so he simply shrugged and moved on. "Will the three of you be helping us out?"
"That is why we have been sent. I have already corresponded with Professor Velten for the last couple of weeks, so we know what to expect. We have a lot of work ahead of us."
Perhaps Ves could make use of their presence.
"All three of our designs could use a lot of help. If I may say so, I think it’s best you start with the Inheritor design. The light skirmisher is our most stagnant project and could dearly use a firm push."
"Ah, your famous Inheritor mechs. Well, we can’t make any promises, but we will see what we can do. Perhaps our specialties will provide the breakthrough you are hoping for. We make no promises, though. We are restricted in the advances we can extend to the Vandals. Trading some of our prized secrets will demand an equivalent trade."
"We expect nothing less." Alloc answered for Ves. "We can compensate you for any assistance you can provide or technologies you can introduce to us through your shell companies."
As Alloc discussed the issue with Florissa, Ves learned that the VRF established a concrete presence in the Republic space. In fact, they owned a whole string of shell companies that performed various services on their behalf!
The main issue for the Vandals was that as a legitimate mech regiment, it couldn’t resort to pirating designs and exclusive technologies. To make such a transaction seem proper and above board, the VRF made use of its shell companies to provide some of their transactions with the veneer legitimacy.
It all sounded very shady to Ves, but apparently that was the way the Vandals and the rebels always did business.
As the two older mech designers engaged in their own conversation, Ves had been left with the two younger ladies. Both Iris and Lucille looked charmingly at Ves with big, blinking eyes. Ever since they associated him with Master Olson, they inched a little closer to him, though that was difficult since they sat across the dining table.
Of the two, Ves hadn’t heard much from Lucille, so he decided to ask about her background. "So, are the Hornbachs a family of mech designers like the Jupiters?"
"No, nothing like that." She shook her head. "I started studying material sciences and transitioned into mech design halfway. No one in my family has ever been involved with designing mechs before. It turns out that designing mechs is a lot more enjoyable to me. After I graduated, I already had a job lined up at a major mech manufacturer."
"So did you already specialize in designing heat sinks?"
Lucille nodded. "I became famous for that immediately. I studied long hours into the night after work to increase my knowledge on heat sinks. I worked hard in the company to assist in designing the best heat sinks for their products. All of this went well until..."
"Until?"
"Until the patron of the mech manufacturer fell. I thought that the company that I worked for was an independent business. Only later did I find out that it’s actually owned by a small count who fell out of favor. Once his enemies got rid of him, they took over all of his assets, including his company. That’s when all the trouble began."
"Did they harass you?"
"Nothing of the sort. They simply raided the money the company had set aside to invest in new licenses and research. We needed that money to develop new mech designs. Without it, our future was bleak. Eventually the company let me go because they couldn’t afford to retain so many mech designers."
That didn’t sound so bad. "So how did getting fired end up with you joining the rebels? That’s quite a leap, you know."
Lucille smiled a little ruefully at him. "I joined on my own volition."
Ves wanted to rub his fingers in his ears. Did he hear that correctly? "Isn’t that a little premature. Not that I have anything against the VRF. It just sounds a bit impulsive to me."
The young woman sighed and brushed back her lustrous black hair. "I put my heart and soul in that company. They truly made me feel at home. Having been ripped away from them, only to see them deteriorate from lack of investment pained me more than anything. I pity those who are still left in the company trying to plug a ship that is leaking air from over a thousand different holes.
Ves somewhat believed her, even if he thought she was being a little hasty with her decision. Many companies tried to foster loyalty and commitment among their workforce. Ideally, each person who worked for the company would develop a cult-like attachment to them. It was the best formula to retain talented employees and it had worked for humanity for thousands of years.
Miss Lucille sounded like a typical dupe who had bought in to the whole corporate culture.
"Are you happy with the VRF?"
"I am, though there are too many mech designers in their ranks I think. That makes it a little more difficult for me to stand out."
"I imagine it helps that you specialize in designing heat sinks. Not a lot of people pay attention to them, despite relying heavily on them to keep their mechs running."
"If you think about it, every mech is a giant heat generator." Lucille said. "Energy is converted into various movements and attacks. Large amounts of waste heat emerge from these transformations. Despite the progress that our race has made since they emerged from Old Earth, we still haven’t been able to achieve perfect efficiency. Waste heat is a fact of life, no matter the race. Whether it’s humans or aliens, we are all facing the same constraints."
Many mech designers treated heat sinks as an annoying necessity that hey begrudgingly include in their designs because it wouldn’t function without them. That was the wrong mentality to adopt. Heat sinks formed a vital function that wasn’t any less important than a power reactor.
One part generated usable energy, while the other part handled the waste heat.
Ves had in fact gained a new appreciation of heat sinks ever since he won the Amastendira. The wondrous weapon that utilized some of the most advanced technologies from the galactic center utilized something which the weapon referred to as a dimensional heat sink.
It basically absorbed any waste heat within its body and shunted it into another dimension, thereby solving the problem in the easiest but also most extravagant manner possible.
Although the dimensional heat sink only worked up to a point, it was still an amazing picture of what the end point of heat sink technology looked like. Ves hoped that he could incorporate them into his own design one day.
Ves entered a brief discussion about heat sinks with Lucille. Despite his broad base of knowledge, Lucille knew quite a bit about materials science, while her insights into thermodynamics veered into a completely unknown territory to him.
It became clear that with regards to heat sinks, she was truly a specialist who was leagues ahead compared to a generalist like Ves.
Someone with her specialty was in high demand to any design team that worked on spaceborn mechs or mechs that predominantly relied on energy-intensive weapons such as lasers.
The banquet ran on for several hours until it came at an end. During this time, Ves spent most of his time learning more about what they brought to the table as mech designers. As Iris and Lucille both possessed specialties that pertained to specific components, they could potentially provide a substantial boost to the three designs that the Vandals still kept developing.
As the guests retired to their own compartment aboard the Wolf Mother, Ves and Alloc walked back to their own section of the massive ship. The corridors had dimmed down a little, signifying that it was standard night time.
Once they fell well out of earshot from the Vesians who attended the banquet, Alloc began to speak.
"Did you enjoy your time with the girls?"
"Uhm, they’re very competent, sir."
"Rrrright. Competent. Interesting choice of words." The Journeyman curled up his lips before bringing them down to a frown. "Don’t fall for their tricks. The VRF always sends out a couple of vixens to us. They’re always easy to talk to and pleasing to the eye, but that still can’t change the fact that they’re Vesians."
Ves grasped the implied meaning and stopped smiling as well. "I understand. I think. If that’s the case, what is the VRF after?"
"It’s one of the many games they play. The VRF may not look impressive as an insurgency movement, but their influence reaches well beyond the borders of the kingdom. They have their fingers in a lot of different pies. Don’t underestimate their skill in trade and diplomacy. They’re always out to make a deal with you, couched in terms that sound great at first, but turn out to come with several inconvenient caveats."
"If they’re so inconvenient, then why do the Vandals accept this kind of behavior, sir?"
"Don’t ask me." Alloc shrugged helplessly. "I once asked the same thing to Professor Velten. She told me that it’s one of the concessions the Vandals have made to the VRF. The slick-talking diplomats of the rebels have even gotten us to agree that any mech designer that wants to defect to the VRF is allowed to do so without restrictions."
That really got Ves to halt. What a ridiculous concession! "Has anyone ever taken up this offer?"
"Pff. Look at how few designers are on our design team and you have your answer."
That was impossible. There was no way the Vandals would tolerate the VRF stealing over eighty mech designers from them. Ves looked at Alloc with a suspicious eye.
"Okay, maybe I exaggerated." Alloc held up his hands. "Only five mech designers that I know of has defected to the VRF over the past decade. Those mech designers haven’t been content in their current postings anyhow, so good riddance to them. The only regret that we have is that they are all rather good at what they do. The VRF mainly targets Journeyman Mech Designers. That’s what Florissa is here for. She’s mainly targeting me and the two other Journeymen in our department."
Though age gaps didn’t count for much in this day and age, people would still from at couples whose ages visibly diverged. It would be unseemly for Ves to hook up someone like Florissa.
Instead, he could look forward to the advances of Iris and Lucille. Great.
"Well, the cat’s out of the bag. Now that I know, I won’t fall for their tricks." Ves declared with some conviction.
"That’s what they all say, Ves, but when it comes to the matters of the heart, we turn into some of the dimwitted sentient beings in the galaxy. Love makes you stupid."
Despite Alloc’s warnings, Ves did not think much of the threat posed by the three women. He was a Larkinson, and a Larkinson never abandoned the Republic. He also thought of himself as a rational thinker. Though he acted on a couple of reckless impulses from time to time, at his core he believed himself to be an enlightened thinker.
There was no way Ves would turn silly because of a silly face.
The design department gathered in the conference room next day. Professor Velten introduced the three guests from the VRF to everyone.
"I expect you to treat our guests with decorum, but also be mindful of what you are and aren’t allowed to say. I’ll send you a detailed list after this meeting. Read it carefully and memorize what you are not allowed to tell. I don’t need to remind you that the Mech Corps doesn’t take it lightly if they see elements of their exclusive technologies ending up in the hands of the Vesians, no matter if they are royalists or rebels."
Once she made her point clear, she moved on to the main point. "With the arrival of the delegation from the VRF, our plans have accelerated. Our main fleet is currently on track to arrive at our target in roughly two weeks. This means there is no time to implement any major revisions for the time being. The main priority of the Vandals is to repair and upgrade every mech that still needs working on. Make no mistake. We need as many mechs operational as possible."
This was it. The first major operation of the Flagrant Vandals since he arrived. And this one was a real doozy. Though his days aboard the Wolf Mother had passed by in peace, in actual fact the factory ship and her escorts dove deeper and deeper into Vesian space.
It was actually a miracle that the Mech Legion hadn’t found them out. That and the VRF did a good job securing passage for the Vandals.
One of the other Journeymen raised his hand and asked a question. "What will our jobs be?"
"Your design teams are to continue to seek every possible method of improving the performance of your designs. Our guest designers will offer their services to to your teams on a semi-rotating basis. Try and get a quick fix done within a week so we can quickly propagate those fixes to the current crop of mechs that the Vandals have on hand."
After that, everyone split up and got to work. Florissa, Iris and Lucille all started to advise the design teams on how to tweak or improve their chosen specialties. No matter their motives, Ves had to admit that their specialized knowledge came in really handy.
In particular, Florissa’s extensive expertise on flight systems far surpassed everyone else’s grasp on this large and complex part. Professor Velten might possess a much broader base of knowledge, but even the old lady hadn’t immersed herself into perfecting flight systems to such an extent.
The Vesian Journeyman practically charmed everyone with her friendly demeanor and and openness to answering any questions the Apprentices asked. She rotated between the design teams of the Inheritor and the Hellcat, but due to a lack of time, the professor instructed her to focus most of her efforts on improving the flight system of the Hellcat design.
"The Hellcat is one of our best mechs, and has to be in tip top shape for the upcoming operation. We also have much less Hellcats on hand, so it will be easier to modify them all in time for the Vandals to begin their assault."
When Ves heard about the decision, he winced and shook his head. It seemed like the Inheritor could never earn a break.
As for Lucille, her expertise into heat sinks led Professor Velten to instruct the Vesian Apprentice to spend most of her efforts on improving the maximum heat capacity of the Akkara heavy cannoneer design.
"The Flagrant Vandals will be descending from orbit numerous times according to the latest plans. Since we are rather lacking in the ranged firepower department, it is of utmost importance that our Akkara mechs can output as much firepower as possible to defend our landing zones."
With the two guest designers already veering away from the other designs, the Inheritor design was left with hardly any love. The only guest designer who remained was an odd bird who possessed a specialty that wasn’t conductive to quick fixes.
Nevertheless, Ves thought he could use her esoteric qualifications as a vehicle to enact his own improvements.
The good thing was that Iris was remarkably open to his ideas. She smiled at him and touched his shoulder with her palm. "That’s great! I was afraid I wouldn’t be of use. The VRF has a lot riding on this operation as well, you know. Anything that can make the Vandals stronger will also make our lives easier as well."
Ves hadn’t heard anything like that before.
"The Vandals aren’t raiding the industrial star system on their own?"
"Of course not, silly." Iris held up a hand in front of her mouth as she giggled. "Industrial star systems are heavily protected by several garrison regiments. While not all of them are mech regiments, their combined strength is more than what the Vandals can handle even if they bring all of their assets to bear. That’s why you need us."
"You mean the rebels don’t have any qualms with being seen together with the Vandals?"
Something like that sounded truly crazy. Rebels working in concert with their foreign enemies was generally seen as a profound betrayal that wouldn’t endear the citizens standing on the sidelines.
"That’s we aren’t planning on showing up in our own colors. Our organization and its partners have already applied the coatings of a pirate organization to our mechs. Our presence will therefore be explicitly seen as a destructive one, rather than an attempt at liberating the star system. It’s too early to attempt such a momentous action."
That was a devious if dishonest plan. Ves had to applaud their daring to moonlight as pirates. They could rain as much destruction as they wanted while their public mouthpieces decried the devastation and put the blame on the fat and lazy nobles that let the pirates run roughshod over their star system.
What Iris revealed to Ves hinted at the magnitude of the next operation. This was no simple smash and grab kind of raid. This was a major assault on a highly developed star system. The ensuing damage would be hard to imagine, but so would the loot the Vandals might be able to abscond.
To his eyes, the Vandals definitely played with fire this time. They took on an unimaginable amount of risk, but if their daring action succeeded, the rewards would be enough to turn around the fortunes of the declining mech regiment.
Besides robbing the abundant amount of riches that any industrialized star system possessed, a victory would also be a major boost to their reputation. Striking the Imodris Duchy a blow that they would continue to feel for generations would definitely be a feat that the Mech Corps had to propagandize as far and wide as possible.
The Vandals definitely aimed to secure a continuation of their existence.
Because the stakes were so high, Iris had been tasked to find any way boost the performance of the neural interfaces in any way possible. Even if the manipulation of neural interfaces was fraught with catastrophic failures, Velten did not have the luxury to keep an expert on the sidelines.
Due to her strange expertise, Ves happened to be a good fit for her. His supposed expertise accomplished something similar to what Iris accomplished, but from a different approach. In the end, they both aimed to increase the compatibility of the mech pilots with their mechs.
Since the Akkara and Hellcat designs already enjoyed the attention of the two other Vesian designers, Ves steered Iris into working on the much less appreciated Inheritor design. She broke her perpetually charming smile upon hearing his suggestion.
"Is the Inheritor not a low-class design? It is hardly worth our attention."
Ves became a little angry at her casual dismissal of a design that hundreds of mech pilots relied on to stay alive. "There are many lives at stake, far more than with the Hellcat and the Akkara mechs. If you care at all about the lives of those poor pilots, then you owe it to yourself to better their chances of surviving the coming battle."
To her credit, Iris noticed his displeasure and quickly turned contrite. She bowed in front of him. "I’m sorry! That was very insensitive of me. I hope you can forgive me!"
He had mixed feelings about her sudden apology. She made a very convincing display of being sincere in her regret, so Ves couldn’t it again her. He softened a bit and nodded.
"Don’t forget our creed as mech designers. We exist to serve the mech pilots and better their ability to fight. Sometimes I think that some of my colleagues have forgotten this priority."
As someone who grew up among the Jupiters, it was impossible for her to be ignorant of this saying. Otherwise, their family wouldn’t have been trusted by the MTA to work on developing new neural interfaces.
"I will take your words to heart." She pressed her hand on her chest. "Please show me around."
Ves brought Iris to the workplace of Inheritor design team. All of the mech designers were somewhat familiar to Ves, but the presence of Iris was a novelty to them, especially since she was a very pretty girl.
However, Iris stuck close to Ves, which somehow made it impossible for the other men to approach her or pull her into a conversation. They all looked back at Ves with mixed expressions.
Ves did not have time to play any games. He immediately broached the topic of coming up with some short-term fixes for the Inheritor. "What kind of fixes have you guys been planning?"
The Journeyman in charge of the team answered his question. "You know our situation as well as I do. We essentially have nothing to suggest."
Ves expected this answer, though he still felt disappointed when he heard it from the team leader’s mouth. Every easy fix possible had already been exhausted before. The Inheritor design team had in fact come up with many more solutions, but the only way they could implement them was if Professor Velten lifted the restrictions imposed on the design.
Fat chance of that ever happening.
Therefore, Ves planned to be a little creative this time. "This is Iris Jupiter. As you know, she knows more about neural interfaces than all of us put together. I suggest we allow her total leeway into seeing if she can improve the neural interface of the Inheritor and assist her in any way possible. What are your thoughts?"
No one objected to his suggestion, partially because they didn’t have a direction and Ves just pointed one out for them. Even the Journeyman went along with him. Years of working on the frustrating mess that was the Inheritor design had really taken a toll on his confidence.
Meanwhile, Laida sat quietly at the side. She hadn’t spoken up even once, but she regarded Iris with an ambivalent attitude. The design teams of the Vandals generally held quite a few more men than women, and the introduction of Iris to their team completely changed their dynamics.
After settling in, Iris immediately went to work. She sat behind a spare terminal and browsed all of the relevant design schematics and documents in rapid tempo. Ves sat next to her and worked on preparing his own solution.
His main issue was that it wasn’t easy to foster the X-Factor in a mech. Certainly, the difficulties increased exponentially when dealing with a collaborative project that had already produced many copies of the mechh.
Ves simply didn’t think about raising the X-Factor of the Inheritor all the way to a B-grade. Raising it to an F or an E-grade would be enough of an accomplishment, but only if he could find a way to achieve such a feat.
How could he bestow the X-Factor to a design that was already mature? How would he be able to achieve this without overhauling an entire mech?
While Iris devoured every detail about the Inheritor design she was allowed to access, Ves practically sat motionless as he struggled to come up with an approach that worked.
Before the Mech Corps assigned him to the Vandals, Ves never truly collaborated with another mech designer on a joint design. Sure, he modified plenty of existing mechs and he briefly worked together with another mech designer during a competition, but those didn’t concern true mechs.
The Inheritor design spawned hundreds of mechs and formed the backbone of the Vandal spaceborn mech contingent. Due to the constant minor updates to its design, a lot of variations existed within the mech regiment, but all of them roughly shared the same commonalities.
This also happened to include their spiritual stunting. They never had the chance to develop even a hint of life from the onset their design came into being. To someone like Ves who exhibited a basic appreciation for almost every mech, this attitude of treating them as disposable commodities irked him in a very fundamental way.
That mentality clashed squarely against his budding design philosophy.
What he faced right now was perhaps one of his greatest test in his career. Even if no one would put him to task for failing to come up with a solution, he would still feel bad for himself for letting the Inheritor mechs be deployed into battle in their grossly inadequate states.
To find a viable approach to this seemingly impossible task, Ves needed to go back to the root of his theory on the X-Factor.
What did he wish to accomplish?
"I want the Flagrant Vandals to succeed with as few losses as possible."
"I want the Inheritor design to receive more appreciation to increase the odds of success."
"I want the Inheritor to be a mech that possesses just enough life to be of assistance to its mech pilot."
What means did he possess to engender the X-Factor into a design or mech?
"I can work on a mech in person and infect it with my focused mentality."
Ves already proved this method worked. The spiritual entity of a mech was a smorgasbord of all the emotions and thoughts of the people who worked on the mech and its design. This was why his gold label mechs possessed such a strong X-Factor and why the mechs the MTA materialized into being appeared clinically dead.
As much as Ves knew for certain that this method worked, the amount of labor involved was exorbitant. There was a reason why the LMC sold less than a hundred of his coveted gold label mechs despite their enviable profit margins.
It required too much personal attention from him, and he had better things to do with his time. Forcing a mech designer to fabricate a mech in person was like forcing an architect to construct a house by hand.
"This is the dumbest solution available to me. It works, but it’s not practical."
To truly affect every Inheritor at once, Ves needed to affect a change in its design, and subsequently allow it to be passed on to the mech technicians who applied his changes into the existing mechs.
Ves had never done anything like this before. The challenge daunted him because we was treading completely new ground, and unlike before, he did not have access to his precious Mech Designer System to cheat his way out.
Still, System or not, Ves had never relied on its help to progress his understanding of spirituality and the X-Factor. Everything he gained so far had been products of his own enginuity. Mostly.
He turned back to his original goal, to find a way to induce a comprehensive improvement of the X-Factor in each copy of the Inheritor. To do so, the design itself needed to acquire measurable amount of X-Factor.
"According to my theories, all it takes is my personal involvement."
Ves possessed a substantial amount of Spirituality, far beyond a regular human being. This enabled him to imprint his thoughts onto an existing mech with some effort. The same should apply to working on an existing design.
To sum it up, it did not matter what kind of changes he made to his design. As long as he did it extensively enough to leave his fingerprints on the design, its X-Factor should definitely be contaminated by his thoughts. Perhaps enough to foster some kind of life in this deadbeat design.
All of this sounded as if he came up with a solution to his problem, but in fact Ves was no better off than before. "I can’t think up a way to improve this design."
Therein lay the rub. With several Apprentices and a Journeyman working day after day on this design, its level of optimization had reached an insane level. Even if they focused on cutting costs rather than increasing its performance, so much time had passed and so much work had been done that a newcomer like Ves wouldn’t be able to spot any holes in its design.
Ves turned to Iris, who tucked her coiffed blond hair behind her ear. Perhaps she noticed his stare, because she turned her head and looked at him with a questioning expression. "What is it, Ves?"
"Ah, I’m still brainstorming some ideas. I’ve thought of several ways to improve this design, but they can’t be applied because Professor Velten won’t allow it to exceed the hard limits imposed on it. I can’t get around these limitations."
Not normally at least, but with the help of Iris he may be able to accomplish something. "I’d like to work together with you for something."
"Uh, what?"
"When you come up with some modifications, bundle some of mine in them as well. I’ll try and come up with some ways to compliment your work so that they’ll mesh well together. Then, let’s serve our work in front of Professor Velten and see whether she’s still willing to reject our combined solution."
"I’m not so sure about this, Ves. It sounds as if these hard limits exist for a reason. If she’s as obstinate as you say, she won’t change her mind just because of my presence here."
She had a point. His suggestion may not sink in to that old coot and her rigid insistence on keeping the Inheritor as light as small as possible.
"Then perhaps I can go at it in a different direction." He mused for a moment. "I think I have a way to stay within the limit. Instead of upgrading the design, I can sidegrade it. The mech won’t improve, and there’s a risk of introducing inefficiencies, but I think this is the right way to go."
Iris didn’t agree with his assertion. "The Inheritor is highly optimized in its current configuration. A downgrade will certainly lead to unintended consequences. Without months of testing, you can’ insure that the design will take a step backwards in performance."
"Even if you’re right, I still have to try."
They turned back to their work. Iris spent the first day reading up as much as she could before requesting to see some Inheritors in person. While she toured the Wolf Mother’s various hangars to observe the mechs take some readings, Ves sat behind his terminal hard at work at overhauling one of the most important but also inconsequential parts of a mech.
The cockpit.
When Iris came up with her quick fix, she would inevitably demand a change to the cockpit’s neural interface. This device played the main role in establishing a connection between a mech pilot and a mech.
Some neural interfaces put hard bucket helmets on the top of a mech pilot’s head. Others extended alloy rods on each side of the headrest of the piloting chair. Many more did not employ a visible apparatus at all. Instead, their workings had been embedded into the seat or behind a wall panel and worked to establish a fully remote connection.
Each method came with their own advantages and disadvantages. The Inheritor employed a wireless design due to the mech’s tendency to perform lots of rapid turns in space. While the cockpit’s inertial compensators negated most of the g-forces applied to the mech pilot, they didn’t always work as intended, especially when the cockpit sustained damage.
Therefore, light mechs predominately utilized a remote interfacing method, thereby allowing mech pilots to jostle their heads around in every direction without bumping into anything stiff.
These remote connections generally worked fine, but their reliability always came into question when fighting in an area with heavy interference. For example, fighting somewhere close to a sun or a black hole where all kinds of strange effects occur would always interfere with the signal between the mech and mech pilots.
Better technology and higher quality designs helped mitigate this problem, but even in the galactic center, nothing could beat a physical connection.
One of the ways in which Ves thought that could work was to suggest Iris to come up with a plan to switch the remote interface to a physical buckethead interface. Some mech pilots preferred the so-called buckethead interface because its reliability was without question.
Naturally, it didn’t need to be shaped like a bucket. That was just a general term that mech pilots and mech designers used. The more correct term was helmet, and it could even be stripped down to a headband if needed.
No matter the size and shape, the shift from a remote interface to a buckethead interface allowed for modest weight and space savings. A remote interface came with a lot of complexity that could only be dealt with by sufficiently powerful hardware.
In comparison, a buckethead interface worked relatively straightforward. It was an old school technique that had received countless of refinements over the centuries. Many superfluous aspects and parts had shrunk over the time, to the point where they only took up half the space of a remote interface.
Ves opened up a design program, loaded the file of the Inheritor design, and proceeded to draw some sketches for his changes.
The first thing that had to go was the old neural interface. He would leave the job of filling the gap to iris. In the meantime, Ves turned back to the design and began to sketch out further changes to the interior of the cockpit.
"Raise the height of the forward console by 2 millimeters."
"Change the seat leather from an organically sourced leather to a synthetic substitute."
"Four monitor projections to the left is overkill. A mech pilot often uses two at most. I can definitely shave one off."
Ves did not focus on solving the major issues of this design. Instead he homed in on the cockpit and planted a lot of minute changes that no one except Ves would notice.
None of what he suggested so far would be able to propel the Inheritor’s performance to another level. The quality and magnitude of his work didn’t matter as much as how much time he spent on leaving his fingerprints on the design.
The more, the better. Volume counted the most. Even if it was an inconsequential change such as shifting the chair of the pilot forward by a millimeter, it did not change the fact that the design had been affected by his intentions, however brief it may be.
Over the next several days, Ves continued on his project to overhaul the entire interior of the cockpit. Iris meanwhile followed his suggestion and worked on designing a buckethead interface to replace the old and familiar remote interface that the Vandals had always used for this mech model.
Both of them rushed to complete their work as fast as possible. Ves had in fact finished his laundry list of trivial modifications, but he still needed to spend several more days in simulating every possible thing that could go wrong.
Several things did in fact turn up creating new vulnerabilities, but it was a lot easier to Ves to simulate the cockpit as opposed to an entire mech. Ves rapidly plugged the holes as they came.
Once they reached the end of the week, Ves and Iris both stepped forward into Velten’s office, ready to present their solutions. They walked close together and when they sat down on their chairs, Iris put her hand over Ves’ hand, which he readily accepted.
This was a moment of truth for the both of them. Ves smiled at Iris before he turned to face the old lady.
"Well, what have the two of you achieved? I hope you haven’t wasted the last week. Let’s hear your proposal."
No Senior Mech Designer ever made it to their rank by being stupid. Despite her slow responses and her erratic behavior, when it came to mechs, Professor Velten was as razor sharp as any mech designer.
She immediately took note of the abundance of superfluous elements in his design proposal.
"Mr. Larkinson, of all the elements of a mech that you could have chosen to work on, you focused on the cockpit. Worse, besides switching the neural interface systems, most of these changes appear to be purely cosmetic! I can understand if you’ve made the cockpit sturdier or increased its ability to withstand a breach, but all you have done is rearrange its interior! What do you have to say for yourself?!"
Ves held up his hands. "It’s not cosmetic, ma’am! Far from it! Every adjustment I have made is needed to increase the ergonomics of the cockpit!"
In order to cover for his ability to affect a mech pilot through the X-Factor, Ves had delved into real ergonomics several times before. Just for this occasion, he brushed up on his theory by referencing the textbooks the Mech Corps made available through the central database.
"According to Leitzbritz’s theory of luminescent comfort, putting more than three projectors in a row will excessively distract the mech pilot and..."
"The height of the piloting chair is set according to the average height of every mech pilots in the service more than a century ago. That’s fine as a whole, but the average height of the mech lots in the Flagrant Vandals is a little bit shorter than that..."
Ves basically spun a tale of nonsense cloaked in scientific rigor. The vast majority of his adjustments had no point. They were only there so that Ves could leave his fingerprints on the design. While he changed plenty of things inside the interior, getting these changes approved was a very different matter.
After a couple of minutes of blabbering on, Ves reached the end of his prepared speech. He waited in a tense moment of silence as Velten parsed his words.
"I have no doubt that your applications are sound." She conceded slowly and knocked a gnarly knuckle against her desk. "Yet none of it seems worth it. How will any of these changes improve the performance of the Inheritor? As much as you tout the benefits of this proposal, there is an alarming lack of hard estimates on how much the design will improve. How am I supposed to approve to the wholesale modification of every Inheritor in our possession, thereby wasting a large portion of our limited logistical capacity?"
In other words, Ves might have talked a good game, but he hadn’t been able to justify why the Vandals should overhaul the cockpit interiors of every Inheritor. It wouldn’t take a lot of time and effort to rearrange the interior of a single cockpit, but it was an entirely different story when it came to hundreds.
A mech regiment as large as the Flagrant Vandals constantly ran their production equipment night and day, doing all sorts of tasks. The mech technicians always had more things to do. Thus, convincing the Vandals and Professor Velten that his changes was worthwhile would always be an uphill battle.
Fortunately, Ves already prepared an answer to this question. He withdrew a data chip from his pocket and gently put it on the desk. "I have already tested out the changes. The raw data and the results are in the data chip. Please take a look, professor."
The professor looked at him with a little skepticism, but she didn’t dismiss the data chip out of hand. As she slid the secure data device in her terminal, she began to peruse the logs and data that Ves had recorded during the tests.
This was his trump card for this meeting. During his stay with the design department, he heard many stories about Professor Velten. Everyone spoke about her ironclad rigidity on certain matters.
If she expected someone to finish a report within a day, he better well do it or he would face a reckoning.
If she said that someone should increase the performance of a specific component by a couple of percentage point, the entire design team would be forced to slave for weeks or months until they finally achieved their goal.
A mech designer like the professor was set in her ways, and she never showed any leeway in anything. That troubled Ves a lot, and he struggled to think of to deal with this personality trait until he realized that if he played things correctly, it could play to his advantage.
While most of his fellow mech designers grumbled about Velten’s inflexibility, Ves recognized that she was simply a mech designer that worked in terms solid numbers and quantifiable results. In other words, she was a very data driven engineer.
To overcome the objections of someone who was driven by data, Ves merely had to serve up additional data that played in his favor. So in the final day before he had to report to the professor, Ves brought Iris to one of the Wolf Mother’s hangars and conferred with Chief Carmon and Lieutenant Chandis.
"I have a way to renew the Inheritor." He began after pulling them aside. "Iris and I have worked on a set of minor modifications that will boost the performance of a mech pilot. The changes aren’t very big, but it could potentially be the start of something bigger."
Ves proceeded to explain a summary of what he had in mind.
"What do you need us for then?" Chief Carmon asked as she crossed hear hefty arms and chewed on an illegal stimulant. "I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but we’re kind of busy right now. We don’t have time to spend on installing fancy frills like a spiffed up cockpit."
The lieutenant voiced his own objections as well. "My men are used to piloting with bare heads. They won’t take buckethead interfaces very well. Light mech pilots really hate those unwieldy things!"
"Don’t knock it until you try it! I only need one mech and a test pilot to gather some data. What will it hurt? Besides, once I can get this modification proposal approved, it might open the door to further improvements."
They both thought that this was a waste of time, but the carrot that Ves had dangled at the end sounded very tempting. If Ves could get the obstinate professor to approve of further modifications to the Inheritor design, then they stood a chance of vastly improving its survival rate.
To that end, letting Ves free reign on a single Inheritor mech was a cheap price to pay.
"Okay, you’ve convinced me. Go ahead, but don’t change anything else!"
"Thanks!"
Ves and Iris proceeded to inspect the Inheritors in the hangar and selected the most up-to-date one because it matched the current design the closest.
After that, Ves personally worked on tearing out the old interior and replacing it with his own. He did everything in person, from fabricating new replacement parts, to assembling them into place at their exact positions.
Iris in the meanwhile worked to fabricate and install the buckethead interface system. Though Ves could have taken care of this chore on his own, he found it best to leave it to a genuine expert.
"It’s best you leave it to me because I can tailor this neural interface to our test pilot." She said. "Not all neural interfaces are born the same. The best ones are made to accommodate the mind of a specific mech pilot."
So Ves left the job of installing the best neural interface system as possible on their testbed mech while Ves cobbled together the rest. He worked quickly but efficiently, helped by the fact that none of the work involved anything challenging. At his level of skill, putting together the revamped interior was a piece of cake.
All the while he worked on overhauling the interior, he focused his mind on the Inheritor in order to foster its X-Factor. Since it wasn’t his own design, he did not attempt to usurp its dominant flavor, nor did he try to go directly against the intentions of the original designers.
The Inheritor’s X-Factor still needed a direction, though. While he couldn’t go against the mech’s original intentions, he could add something small to it that nudged it in a better direction.
Therefore, when he drew up the modifications to the design, he infused it with a single, abstract idea, one that would have presence even if it was diluted to an enormous extent.
Anything more complex might not hold up because of his lack of involvement in the design. Ves had seen plenty of mechs of other designers that held some potential, but ended up with stillborn spirits. That was because even if the mech designer put a lot of his heart into his design, he washed his hands off them as soon as he completed it, and left the production of the mechs to some efficiency-driven mech manufacturer.
Thus, Ves needed to keep things simple. After a bit of thinking, he bestowed the Inheritor design with the concept of survival.
Why survival? It was more than simply wishing that it would last longer on the battlefield, though that would certainly help. Ves chose to focus on the concept of survival because it was the primary drive of a short-lived species, no matter if it was mechanical or biological in nature.
Ves likened it to humanity’s place in the galaxy. Were they not like the Inheritor version of a sentient race? When humans first sprang up during the Age of Space, they were seen as weak and pathetic sentients by the alien races that ruled their corner of the galaxy. Humanity’s intelligence, strength and lifespan all fell below average to the more privileged races that evolved on planets with an abundance of exotics.
Well, humanity enjoyed the last laugh. Their lack of dependence on exotics and relatively high birth rate allowed them to outgrow those stagnant and snobby alien races.
Yet why did humanity come to dominate half the galaxy while other humanoid races that shared the same broad traits wallowed in obscurity?
Many human supremacists likened their success to fate or their superior genes, but more sober-minded scholars and philosophers attributed it to their drive to survive. Their race faced constant challenges during their rise, and each time they overcame their existential crises through grit and the drive to stay alive.
Survival was one of the most primal goals that drove the human race, and Ves incorporated its purest form into the design and the mech he modified.
He felt it taking shape underneath the materials he shaped and placed according to his will. He even rejected the assistance of bots to help him carry or lift the heavier components. Instead, he did as much work by hand as possible in order to strengthen his involvement into the modification work.
His dedication to his work had not gone unnoticed. Iris paused in her work of installing the neural interface systems to ask him a question.
"You don’t need to lift everything by yourself, Ves. Bots can do the same thing as well, you know? You only need to check their work afterwards if they left some discrepancies."
"It’s not about efficiency. Otherwise I would have listened to your suggestion or let some mech technicians do the heavy lifting. It’s about dedication."
"Dedication?"
"Yeah, it’s..." Ves briefly paused his work to look at Iris. Should he tell her something like this? It hinted strongly towards one of his secrets.
He decided to keep it vague.
"It’s about remaining involved through every step of the way. Without implementing my proposals by my own two hands, how can I know whether they will work as planned? With me on hand, I can instantly recognize if something doesn’t pan out the way I want to. This way, I can insure I will deliver the highest quality possible. That’s the true meaning of dedication."
His words put Iris to thought, but only for a moment. While Ves spoke the truth, it was only a small portion of what he was really after. He hoped that Iris would quickly dismiss his words as wishy washy aspirations and go back to her work.
Instead, she smiled at him and spoke out her own thoughts. "You know, I’ve always had a feeling that mech designers don’t do too much on their own. You’re the first person who put my feelings into words. I always felt better about the mechs which I personally worked on. Now I understand a little. Thank you for that, Ves."
Ves wanted to palm his face. It wouldn’t have been so bad if he mentioned this point to Alloc instead of a Vesian.
The more he worked by her side, the less her identity mattered. They were both mech designers who respected each other’s competences.
His brief blunder with Iris aside, the rest of the installation proceeded without issue. Once the cockpit’s interior became whole again, they invited the mech pilot assigned to this Inheritor to test it out.
"Will anything really change?" Chief Carmon asked with a healthy dose of skepticism.
"I know it doesn’t seem very impactful, but it’s been proved that the surroundings of a mech pilot can drastically influence the way he pilots his mech. A pilot who is uncomfortable in his own mech will only be able to exert eighty percent of his full potential."
Ves quoted an old study that actually tested this premise out. Put a mech pilot in a rotting old rusted cockpit, and his performance fell off a cliff.
Nevertheless, adding excessive comforts in the cockpit risked a backfire as mech pilots tended to become more complacent while they piloted. They lost their edge and became less alert.
After decades of experimentation, the mech industry came to a consensus that the best cockpit was a clean and sterile environment. Any comfort provided to the pilot should be understated and invisible. It should facilitate the mech pilot for long stretches of time without inducing too much physical discomfort. It should also be uncomfortable enough to keep the mech pilots on his toes.
All of this sounded simple at first glance, but in practice it was very hard to apply. Every mech designer held their own ideas on how far they needed to go in terms of inducing comfort and tension.
Ves had always leaned towards the camp that stated that the best way to go was to go with comfort. It fit well with the Blackbeak and the Crystal Lord designs, as they had both been designed to operate for long stretches of time. The X-Factor was also strongly associated with comfort, though not everyone bought this line of thinking.
Many mech designers found excessive attention to this area to be a massive waste of time. Ves remembered his last visit to Leemar, where he got entangled in a design duel with Oleg. Master Olson’s genius disciple strongly believed that designing a stronger mech mattered the most.
"Would you rather sit in a comfy chair as your mech falls short and explodes, or sit in a neutral chair and ride your mech to victory?"
In any case, Chief Carmon and Lieutenant Chandis shared the same skepticism as they watched the mech pilot clamber into the completely renewed cockpit.
"Everything is shifted!" The mech pilot broadcasted from the cockpit. "Give me a couple of minutes! I have to relearn where everything is positioned!"
They waited and waited until the Inheritor finally booted up. The slim mech came to live and started to stretch its hands and fingers.
"How is it going so far?" Ves asked while he glanced at the control panel that showed the Inheritor’s parameters. Everything looked green so far. "Are you feeling okay?"
"Okay? This is more than okay! I feel great!"
The mech pilot displayed the usual exuberance of someone who got dosed in the X-Factor for the first time of their life. Ves was highly familiar to such reactions, so as soon as he heard the jubilation in the voice, he knew he succeeded.
The mech he worked on radiated a faint pressure. It was very weak, and were it not for his highly tuned senses and his knowledge on what to look out for, Ves wouldn’t have been able to spot it. He was afraid that his work on the cockpit was too inconsequential to count, but evidently his fears could be put to rest.
Back at the professor’s office, Ves and Iris waited in their seats as Velten finished parsing the readings.
"I see that your test pilot has performed up to twenty-eight percent better than usual at the start, but diminished as the simulated combat tests dragged on. How can you prove it’s not the placebo effect at work?"
Professor Velten doubted the effectiveness of his changes. She insinuated that the only reason the mech pilot delivered a better performance than the norm was because he was motivated to do so and he mistakenly believed the rearranged cockpit would measurably improve his piloting ability.
Many times, the performance of a mech pilot hinged on his beliefs. If he believed a battle could be won, his morale would be high. If he believed he was being sent into a hopeless battle, his morale would be rock-bottom and he would be constantly be thinking about escaping rather than winning the battle.
If Ves had access to more mechs, he could have setup a rigorous experiment to prove that it wasn’t just a delusion at work. Unfortunately, he was only allowed to work on a single mech, so he couldn’t provide any hard data to prove otherwise.
He instead turned to another argument he prepared beforehand. "I can’t rule out the influence of the placebo effect, but suppose that this may be true, what does it matter? Any chance we can increase the performance of the mech pilots of the Inheritor is one we should grasp. Even if the mech pilots find out the truth and the placebo effect loses its strength, we’ve already reaped the benefits by then. Truth or false, the twenty-eight percent performance boost is very real."
Velten looked very severe at Ves. "You are playing a dangerous game here. You are playing with the fundamental trust that mech pilots have bestowed on mech designers such as you and me. They entrust us with the design of their war steeds. What you have just suggested is a violation of the responsibilities we hold as mech designers."
The accusation bit deep into Ves. The professor wasn’t wrong. Ves essentially tried to pass of snake oil as medicine to their gullible mech pilots. Once they found out the truth, every mech designer aboard the Wolf Mother would suffer a collective loss of trust and intimacy.
"The consequences are heavy, but what’s a little scorn compared to a failed operation and the defeat and dissolution of the 6th Flagrant Vandals? We need to pull out all the stops for the upcoming system assault. In my opinion, we shouldn’t be afraid of resorting to short-term gains that come with a price. As long as we delay the payment, anything is justified."
If his ethics professor back at the Rittersberg University of Technology could hear his words, the old man would smack his face until his cheeks turned red.
Professor Velten shook in her seat, and it seemed as if she contemplated doing the same, despite the risk of breaking her fragile hands. A few seconds later, she subsided for some reason.
"Do you know that the MTA routinely investigate egregious violations to the code of conduct of mech designers? You do not have to break the law to run afoul of their Compliance Department."
Mentioning the Compliance Department sent a chill through the backs of Ves and Iris. The relatively boring administrative name belied the enormous amount of power they wielded over human space. They enforced the rules set by the MTA and more famously cracked down on any organization that violated the fundamental taboos set at the start of the Age of Mechs.
One of those taboos happened to be a prohibition on the development and propagation of weapons of mass destruction, something which Ves had deliberately stepped upon a while ago. If the MTA ever found out that he worked on a gamma laser rifle, the Compliance Department would hunt for him to the ends of the galaxy.
In short, Ves did not wish to be investigated by the Compliance Department.
Yet on the matter of the cockpit, Ves believed that the MTA had better things to do. They wouldn’t move out their Compliance Department over a small violation of ethics.
"The ends justify the means, especially since the means don’t come with a heavy price." He retorted calmly. "Trust can be regain and bridges can be rebuilt, but the dead can never be brought back to life. What’s the harm of telling a couple of white lies?"
This argument weakened the Senior’s resolve, but it hadn’t been able to tear down her adherence to the rules. "Beneficial or not, it is wrong to deceive the mech pilots. I won’t accept any deception in my department."
This old hag! Ves wanted to curse this stubborn Senior, but held his emotions in check. He absolutely couldn’t afford to reveal his true emotions. His face slipped into an impassive expression as he extended another argument.
"Ma’am, too much is at stake for you to make this decision on your own. Compared to a short-term performance boost of up to thirty percent, it’s a lot better than any other proposal. Why not take it up to Colonel Lowenfield and let her decide? As the commander of this regiment, she should have the ultimate say on what is best for herr mech pilots."
This seemed to resonate with Professor Velten. She mentioned the code of conduct to illustrate why he shouldn’t propose his plans, so Ves threw it back in her face.
The code of conduct stated that mech designers who worked on behalf of a client should be responsive to their demands. Mech designers also needed to be open and transparent about their work, and be ready to flip their designs in a completely new direction if their clients demanded any major shifts.
Ves basically maneuvered the professor into kicking the issue upstairs. If Velten refused to bring the issue up to Colonel Lowenfield, then she would prove that she was a hypocrite who didn’t live by the rules she espoused.
Eventually, the professor came to a decision. "Wait a moment."
A screen that shielded most sounds and transmissions from leaking out sprang up around the professor. Ves patiently waited as Velten rang up the colonel and presumably discussed his proposal.
Several minutes later, the screen disappeared and Velten came back into clear view. Her wrinkled lips pursed with discontent. "The colonel, in her eminent wisdom, has decided that the stakes are too high. She has weighed the extra work your proposal demands and the downsides to lying to our own mech pilots against the benefits that it might bring."
And? Ves wanted to ask, but he kept his eagerness from bursting out his words.
"She approved your proposal. In fact, she gave us broad discretion on how to reschedule the planning so that we can deliver the finished mechs to the mech pilots at the right time. Too soon, and the placebo effect will wear off before we launch the assault. Too late, and the mech pilots won’t be accustomed to the buckethead interface and the other changes."
Ves and Iris grinned. Were it not for sitting in front of a Senior, they would have whooped and cheered.
The most important thing was that Ves finally got something solid past the professor’s walls. Sure, he might have pissed her off, but he didn’t take it too hard. His goals were pure.
The professor spoke again. "You shall be held responsible for coming up with this proposal and implementing it to as many Inheritors as possible. Work with the planners at logistics to get this done. I don’t want my hands to be stained with this project."
"Will do, professor." Ves bowed his head in thankfulness.
Though he hadn’t expected to be held responsible for the broad implementation of his design changes, it was an unexpected boost for him. For as long as Ves stayed aboard the Wolf Mother, he had never gotten exposed to any other major assets of the Vandals. He didn’t know how many ships they owned and how many mechs they could field.
He could finally fill in some of the gaps in his knowledge if he was given the right access. Anyone else might think this job was a bother, but Ves saw it as a prime opportunity to learn more about the Vandals.This material is derived from n0v£lbin•
"How did you know that punting the decision to Colonel Lowenfield would work?" Iris curiously asked Ves after they stepped out of the professor’s office.
"It’s simple. As much as we should respect Professor Velten’s accomplishments, you have to realize that she’s a single cog in the machine that keeps the Flagrant Vandals running. An important cog, but still a tool nonetheless. Her priorities are derived from orders from above, so we shouldn’t expect any flexibility from her. To get an exception, we have to reach the ultimate authority who issued those orders."
From what Ves had gathered about Colonel Lowenfield, she did whatever it took to achieve her goals. That was not to say that she was ruthless, but she recognized she needed to bend the rules sometimes in order to keep the Flagrant Vandals afloat through these difficult times.
"I see. That’s very smart of you, Ves, though I won’t imagine the professor being pleased with what you pulled off. You did disregard her words in front of her face."
"She’s not the one in charge around here. The stakes are too high to follow the normal process. Only by reaching someone who has to take the entire situation into account is qualified to decide on our proposal."
He hadn’t been wrong about the colonel. Despite never having met the figure, Ves heard more than enough stories to paint a basic picture about the commander of the Flagrant Vandals.
Rumor had it that she hadn’t climbed the ranks of the Vandals. Instead, she used to lead another mech regiment before being banished to the Vandals after their previous commander ’mysteriously’ disappeared.
Her posting should have been her downfall, but instead her competence and go-getter attitude revitalized the declining mech regiment. Naturally, most of the Vandals weren’t aware that their existence ran on borrowed money, lots of it in fact.
Hence why this upcoming assault was all the more important. Its scale surpassed a casual raid, but did not reach the level of a full invasion. Their main goal was to steal everything of value and wreak havoc upon the industries of the Vesians, all the while taking into account that enemy reinforcements might arrive at any time.
Speed would therefore be essential to the assault. They couldn’t afford the time to play it slow and safe. The Vandals needed to overwhelm the defenders quickly, and that meant throwing lots of Inheritor mechs at enemy positions.
"Ves?"
"Yes, Iris?"
"What do you think about the Vesia Kingdom?"
Ves slowed his pace in the corridor. Why did she ask such a question to him? "I’d say they’re our mortal enemies. No offense, Iris, but your state has tried to conquer the Republic over and over again. It’s hard not to wish ill of the Kingdom."
"It’s okay. I feel the same way." Iris responded with a gentle tone. She even slid closer to him and wrapped an arm around his back. "I hate the circumstances we live in. Everyone is brought up from birth to respect the nobles and to fight for their cause. We didn’t even realize we were tools to the ruling class until we suffered in person."
"Your family even collaborated with the MTA, right? That should have been a great honor."
The Jupiter Family did well in the Kingdom, but ultimately they weren’t part of a noble House. It only took one incident to tear down everything their lineage had built.
Iris shook her head. "The Vesian ruling class are predominantly mech pilots, did you know that? Competition between heirs is fierce, and often the one who has the bigger fist will win the battle for succession. People have a tendency to flock to potentates, but they don’t realize that much of their lives revolve around training to fight. When every position of leadership in our state is occupied by a glory-hungry battle fiend, it’s no surprise that they are constantly chafing to go to war with your Republic."
"And the norms who stepped over their potentate rivals tend to be schemers or strategists who can deal a lot more damage if they’re in charge of a military force." Ves concurred. "Hardly anyone has inherited a duchy by advocating for peace and mutual respect."
Their culture differed too much from the Bright Republic. Despite being neighbors for hundreds of years, they simply held too many different opinions to live side-by-side in peace. The war between the two states would never end until one of them ceased to exist.
"So back to my question, do you hate the Kingdom?"
Ves had to gather his thoughts for a second. He always hated the Kingdom, but not to the extent of forming a personal vendetta against him. He mostly inherited his dislike for them from his parents and his fellow Brighters. The only time they personally affronted him was when they attempted to raid the Mech Nursery. Even then, he didn’t blame them for doing so.
"Would the Komodo Star Sector be better off if the Vesia Kingdom is wiped off the map? Of that I have no doubt. I don’t hate the people who make up your state. They’re just poor chumps who have been brought up to believe in a flawed and outdated system of governance."
Iris smiled at him. "Thank you for keeping a clear mind. I’m glad you think that way about us. Not everyone in the Kingdom is hungry for slaughter."
They took up their new duties after that. Their new duties basically tasked them with coordinating with logistics and assisting them in establishing the most optimal schedule to overhaul the Inheritors to the modified design.
Ves needed to go to the core of the Wolf Mother for that. Usually highly guarded, the restricted area was where the heart of the Vandals rested. Ves only got a small glimpse of the clean interiors and rows and rows of processors before he got ushered into the office of an officer in charge of logistics.
The next week passed by in a frantic pace. The entire the Vandal fleet began to move and use up some of their stockpile of materials to begin their major overhauls. The Inheritor was not the only design that led to a large-scale adjustment project. Modified designs for the Hellcat and Akkara mechs had gone through as well, forcing the Vandals to stretch their limited industrial capacity even further.
Logistics prioritized the overhaul of the Akkara and Hellcat models over the Inheritors. Ves could do nothing against this favoritism, but he did his best to prevent them from neglecting the Inheritor and to allocate every available bit of spare capacity to modifying the light mechs.
Ves yawned a bit as he sat behind a terminal in the logistics department. His job the last few days amounted to acting like a glorified babysitter. He was there to make sure that logistics did their job and didn’t slack off for some reason for another.
"At least I have access to some of their more restricted information banks this time."
In order to do his job effectively, Ves required an overview of all the assets of the Flagrant Vandals.
This was the fire time he got a broad top-level picture of the strength of the mech regiment.
So when Ves saw that the Flagrant Vandals actively fielded more than three-thousand mechs and mech pilots, his eyes almost popped out of their sockets!
"Three-thousand fieldable mechs!"
The Vandals also carried extra spare mechs, but the important point was that the Vandals possessed way more strength than was typical for a mech regiment.
Most ran with two-thousand mechs for a reason. For the Vandals to accomplished something like this without told him much about their raw ambitions!
Ves bet that a large reason why the Vandals went knee-deep into debt was because of this reckless expansion.
"Why do they need so many mechs? What are they hiding?"
Mech regiments possessed a large amount of authority. They picked their own mech models and organized their units according to their own customs. Some mech regiments fielded fewer than a thousand mechs, while others brought five hundred extra mechs along.
Yet Ves had never heard of a regiment from the Republic with over three-thousand working mechs. All of these mehs happened to be riding on a score of combat carriers and transports that must have cost a lot to obtain.
"A regiment doesn’t expand its strength by fifty percent without a reason."
He tried to scour for additional details from his terminal’s connection to the restricted database, but found nothing relevant that could answer his questions.
Strangely as it seemed, despite the database containing strong signs that a the Vandals fielded an extra thousand mechs, no one aboard the Wolf Mother except for the elites who worked in the restricted section knew about this. What this did mean?
Ves didn’t know.
He truly didn’t know.
After some hesitation, he walked up to the logistical officer and gently asked the fellow what was going on.
"Mr. Larkinson, I don’t need to remind you that you should keep such information locked within your mind. The men outside this section do not need to know that our rolls are considerably larger than is publicly known."
"Understood, sir."
Not a lot of words passed between them. Ves read between the lines that his posting here was of some significance. Despite the boring and thankless nature of his current assignment, the true objective of his presence here seemed to be preparing him for something else. And for that, Ves needed to be aware of the true scale in which the Vandals worked.
At the end of the meeting, the officer left him with one final sentence. "The colonel is keeping an eye on you."
That caused Ves to subconsciously shiver. How did he attract the attention of such a legendary figure within the Vandals? His earlier word play against Professor Velten shouldn’t have been significant enough to register on her radar.
As his mind filled with confusion, he eventually finished his shift and returned to the design department. He returned back in time to grab some freshly cooked dinner, so he eagerly grabbed a plate and sat down at the same table as Laida and Pierce.
"You’re not hanging out with your girlfriend this time?" Pierce verbally jabbed at Ves.
"I beg your pardon?"
"You’re spending most of your time with Iris these days."
Ves coughed with embarrassment. "My relationship with her is purely professional. I’ve never given her an opening to sink her teeth into me. Alloc has already warned me not to entangle myself with the Vesian rebels."
Both of his fellow mech designers shook their heads.
"Don’t you know how the two of you look when you work together side by side?" Laida spoke out. "The two of you are just like a married couple!"
Laida widened her eyes and shoved her palm over her mouth. "Sorry! I don’t mean any disrespect!"
"Hey, I’m just an Apprentice Mech Designer, just like you. There’s no need to apologise."
They awkwardly returned to their meals. As Ves ate some kind of pasta dish, he thought about his interactions with Iris so far. From his perspective, he had acted with perfect propriety throughout his interactions with Iris. The only problem was that the Vesian had a tendency to place her hand or arm around his body.
As much as Ves pretended to be unaffected, he had to admit her touch felt nice. Still, Ves always kept his rationality at the forefront and devoted as much of his attention to the business at hand. This should have been the right approach, but he did not factor in the opinions of others.
Even if he could say that he would never do something as stupid as defect to the Vesian rebels, his words would hold no strength. Laida and Pierce placed more faith on their own observations over any excuses that Ves could come up with.
Ves felt a little alienated by the tentative friends he made during his stay here. Before long, he would be completely separated from his fellow mech designers, just like what had happened during their training phase.
During his shifts at logistics, his expertise often needed to be employed to streamline the mass overhaul projects. If not for his understanding of what it took to perform each overhaul, the planners would have delivered an uneven mix of materials or allocated too many mech technicians to a particular project.
Despite this, the sheer scale of this undertaking meant that screwups happened plenty of times. Shuttles delivered batches of materials to the wrong logistics ship. A chief technician suffered an accident that left him indisposed. Mech pilots of two different squads got into a giant brawl over an argument on whose mechs should undergo an upgrade first.
These incidents revealed that not all was well with the Flagrant Vandals. As much as they showed a lot of outwards strength, internally the rot had already started to set in. Discipline was tight, but not as tight as a proper mech regiment of the Mech Corps.
As Ves spent more days among the wizards who tried to make sense of what went on within the vandals, he became jaded to the incidents. The strain over the last couple of years took a toll on everyone. He didn’t take the annoyances to heart.
While every workshop aboard every ship worked to transform their Inheritors, Hellcats and Akkaras, the massive Vandal fleet continued to transition in and out of FTL.
Guided by their rebel allies, their approach had remained undetected so far. Observation ships and drones that should have detected their presence had long been co-opted by the local rebels who called the shots around these places.
Despite running through the territories of over half-a-dozen different rebel groups, so far none of them seemed to have ratted out their presence in the middle of Vesian territory.
Ves truly didn’t know how the Vesian Revolutionary Front even managed to do so. So many people knew about the intrusion of the Vandals that it should have been impossible to keep a lid under the news, but nevertheless not a single ship of the Mech Legion arrived to confront the intruders.
Anticipation and eagerness started building up among the servicemen of the Vandals. They lived to raid, and the upcoming operation would be one of the most expansive attack since the foundation of their mech regiment.
To attack a prepared industrial star system was entirely different from raiding an underdeveloped system. With industry came wealth. With wealth came strength.
Even the least impressive industrial systems would be able to rally thousands of mechs in their defense. Naturally, only a fraction of them consisted of mechs from the Mech Legion and their local version of the Planetary Guard. Much of the mechs on these planets actually tended to be owned by gangs, mercenary corps and company forces.
Ves had witnessed their strength and behavior in the Glowing Planet campaign. When it came down to it, they always prioritized their own benefits. He envisioned that in the upcoming attacks, most of those outfits would stay put and defend their own stretches of land.
Even if their neighbor got attacked and overwhelmed by a group of Vandal mechs, as long as they didn’t turn their rapacious hunger to them, these forces wouldn’t lift a finger to help.
Thus, the effective amount of mechs arrayed against the Flagrant Vandals should be just a fraction of the star system’s total strength.
The only problem was that a highly developed planet always supplemented their mechs with non-mech garrison troops. As long as the defenders threw enough infantry, tanks and aircraft at the Vandals, their assault would be heavily stymied.
However, this problem would not apply this time. According to the occasional loose lips that escaped from the mouths of the specialists at logistics, all of these regiments had in fact been infiltrated by the rebels to such an extent that they could instantly suppress the loyalists among their ranks and take effective control over their regiments.
Instead of being an asset to the star system’s defense, they would instead aid its downfall. As a cherry on top, the rebels would prime this sequence of events by employing their off-planet assets. Ships and spaceborn mechs disguised as pirates would distract the system’s defenders and stretch them out and defeat them in detail.
Ves did not hear much more of how the Vandals and the rebel movements would do the defenders in, but the audacity of their plans and the scale of their operation truly frightened him. Were it not for the signs that the Vandals and the VRF have possibly planned this move for years, Ves would have tried to weasel his way out.
"The Wolf Mother won’t be staying too far away from the fighting."
This was an operation which required all hands on deck. Besides the hidden force of a thousand mechs, the entire public strength of the Flagrant Vandals would be put to use. The Vandals couldn’t afford to hold back the Wolf Mother and the other logistical ships in a nearby abandoned star system. That would require supplementing their defense with escorts, which would take away too many mechs from the actual assault.
No. Colonel Lowenfield decreed that the logistical ships would travel behind but close to the main fleet. This would allow them to remain in the protective embrace of the main Vandal fleet while simultaneously also providing timely support services.
Of course, they also needed to be close to load up on all the loot the Vandals obtained from the industrial system.
No one expected the Wolf Mother to be threatened, but plans rarely went according to plan. Still, Ves was reasonably assured that she wouldn’t be blown apart. The Vandals valued her too much to let her get scratched.
With a week or so to go until they arrived at their final destination, Ves reached the end of his shift and left the restricted area. As he walked back to the design department, an officer stepped in his way and barred his path forward.
Ves tried to shuffle to the side, but the man who stood in his way moved in the same direction. He started to frown and studied the officer. His shoulder pips designated him as a mech captain, one who led over an entire company of mechs.
"Please make way. I have to return to my assigned compartment."
"Mr. Larkinson, please wait a moment." The officer said. "My name is Captain Branser. On behalf of my men, I just want to express our gratitude to you. We’ve heard of your efforts to attract some attention to the Inheritors that some of my men are piloting. Ever since the mech technicians returned them to our hands, we’ve noticed the difference you’ve made."
"I, ah, that’s good to hear." Ves blinked. "Captain, I’m just doing my job. I should be thankful to your men for their willingness to fight for the Republic."
Branser smiled in a cynical fashion. "For the Republic? Hah, as if. The Republic has done nothing to help us survive. It’s only through the colonel’s efforts and your help that we’ll be able to come back home with most of our lives intact."
Ves ought to feel indignant about his dismissal about the role the Republic played, but in the interests of tact, he let it slide. In fact, he eyed the captain in a different light. This was the first officer of the Vandals who approached him on his own accord and expressed his appreciation for his work.
Perhaps Ves could make use of this unexpected meeting.
"If you aren’t busy, captain, would you like to have a drink with me?"
"Certainly!"
Both of them detoured to a nearby officer’s lounge. The well-stocked bar offered an abundance of authentic liquors while the well-furnished interior gave the lounge a sense of class.
"So I heard you’re a proper Larkinson. Is that true?"
"If you mean I’m related to the famous Larkinsons, then yes, I’m part of the Family. My father is veteran in fact."
"Oh? Which regiment did he serve in?"
As they sat next to a screen that displayed a simulated expanse of stars, Ves began to pump the captain for information. Of course, Ves didn’t go about it in an obvious manner. He lulled the captain into complacency by talking about his youth with the Larkinsons and what he learned while studying mech design.
All the while, Ves poured more alcohol in both of their drinks, which they promptly swigged down at regular intervals. While the captain slowly began to get smashed, Ves retained all of his faculties. Possessing an extreme amount of Endurance sure came in handy at this time.
Once Ves judged that he sufficiently plied the unwitting captain with booze, he started sprinkling some of his actual questions in between their conversation.
"So, I’ve heard a bit about Colonel Lowenfield since the Mech Corps transferred me here. What’s the deal with her?"
"The colonel?" Branser burped while his eyes curled into pleasure. "She sure turned everything around! Back then, we were really running on strings. The money ran out, supposedly. On paper, all of our mechs were in tip-top shape, but in truth half of them were in such an awful state that they’d malfunction as soon as they launched out of the hangar bays!"
"How did the arrival of the new colonel turn all of this around?"
"Beats me!"
"You don’t know, captain?"
"Hey, my job is to pilot a mech. Logistics and finance isn’t my strong suit. That’s where Colonel Lowenfield comes in. She’s a REMF."
As a Larkinson, Ves was more than aware of what the term REMF stood for. It was a highly impolite term for an officer who with a non-combat background. For example, the specialists and officers he worked with at the logistics department didn’t have the strength to scare away a dog, but their work was vitally important in making sure that the Vandals who fought in the frontlines would have access to adequate mechs and supplies.
Still, it came to a huge surprise to Ves that Colonel Lowenfield was not a mech pilot and had never personally wielded a weapon into battle.
"I thought that every commander of a mech regiment is supposed to be experienced in battle." Ves responded with a puzzled tone of voice. "If they aren’t mech pilots, then they ought to be former ones who are too injured to return to the cockpit."
Practically every armed force of the state in the galaxy was led by a current or former mech pilot. It was considered as a near-sacrosanct rule. Mech pilots only respected other mech pilots. Taking orders from a REMF was one of their worst nightmares.
History was littered with many incidents where the mech pilots of a mech regiment mutinied against their non-combat officers.
Captain Branser acknowledged his puzzlement, even as he downed another shot of liquor. "You’d think so, but you’re wrong. The problem with us Vandals is that we got too many muscle-brained fighters and not enough of those clever types. Whoever the Mech Corps punts in our direction tends to be the stupider variants of those kinds of people. I swear the Mech Corps wants to make us all stupid!"
"If that’s so, how did the colonel manage to end up in the Vandals?"
"Oh, it’s all classified and stuff. Supposedly some foul business went on at Citadel Havensworth, and she somehow got banished to our corner of the Republic instead of being cashiered from the service. She even got a promotion to colonel out of it in order to shut her up and make her qualified to lead over the Vandals."
The mentioning of Citadel Havensworth pinged his memories. Ves began to have a bad feeling about this. "Do you happen to know who banished her from the Citadel?"
"Dunno. Can’t remember. Well, maybe it’s the base commander. Ah, I need another shot!"
His worst fear ended up to be true. Depending on the timing, his famous uncle Ark Larkinson may or may not have assumed the duty of base commander. Even if he hadn’t been promoted yet, he would have still been close to that orbit.
The fateful decision to banish Colonel Lowenfield from a prize posting at the frontlines of this current war to the dumping ground of the Mech Corps must have certainly involved Uncle Ark.
Was this way the colonel kept her eye on him?
Not everyone knew about Colonel Lowenfield’s past, and those that did generally kept their mouths shut. Due to the eclectic backgrounds of the servicemen, the Flagrant Vandals developed something of a custom of not looking into anyone’s past.
Ves hoped no one minded his attempt at digging into the colonel’s backstory. He left Captain Branser to sober up with the help of a pill and left the lounge.
What he learned up to this point weighed increasingly heavy on his mind. The more time he spent with the Vandals, the more he learned they weren’t so simple. The rest of the Mech Corps treated the Vandals with disdain, but this also allowed them to bend or break the rules with impunity.
Nominally, the 6th Flagrant Vandals Regiment answered to the 3rd Tarry Division. In practice, the 3rd Tarry exerted almost no measurable influence or control over their erstwhile subordinates. If they placed observers within the ranks of the Vandals, then they must have probably been bought or subverted somehow, because some of the things they did would never fly in the Republic.
"Collaborating with the Vesians, taking loans from unknown entities, exceeding the limits on fieldable mechs, this sure is a doozy."
Ves felt sure that this was just the tip of the iceberg. The Flagrant Vandals had been left to their own devices for so long that they had almost gone feral.
Nobody he met except for those transferred in recently held any belonging to the Republic. Perhaps even those who left family behind became increasingly estranged to their former ties as the strict isolation left them to turn to their fellow servicemen for comradeship.
It seemed as if the only reason they hadn’t cut ties with the Republic was because they wouldn’t get access to the central database anymore. In every other area except research and development, they achieved tentative self-sufficiency.
"Oh, I can’t forget about the debt as well."
He didn’t know how reliable Alloc’s statement of the Vandals being over 200 billion bright credits in the red. From what he had seen so far, the Journeyman might have lowballed the actual figure.
Keeping two-thousand mechs and mech pilots in fighting condition was hard enough. Adding an extra thousand on top of that would bankrupt any force trying to stay afloat by themselves.
There was a reason many private outfits tended to field a hundred mechs or less. The amount of overhead ramped up pretty hard as larger outfits needed to provide more services. Gathering so many mech pilots in a single place also tended to be difficult to manage, as without sufficient discipline, they had a habit of getting into ego-fueled duels and brawls.
The Flagrant Vandals could count on their professionalism to stem the tide of these phenomena, but only to an extent. Working in the restricted area provided him with plenty of signs that discipline had already begun to strain.
A mech regiment that resembled criminal gangs more than a proud unit of the Mech Corps could not expect its mech pilots to
That left Ves with the most pressing question on his mind.
"What is their endgame?"
Ves did not hold any delusions that the Flagrant Vandals fought out of duty, loyalty or patriotism. The Bright Republic was worth fart for these marginalized servicemen.
Colonel Lowenfield seemed to be steering them towards some other goal that he couldn’t quite figure out yet. Whatever it was, she felt it necessary to expand their numbers by half. Given her background as a logistical officer, much of her plans would be well out of sight. People like her knew how to hide plenty of secrets in plain sight.
"The Vandals think that Lowenfield has rescued them from ruin. It’s the opposite. She’s leading them to eventual damnation."
The worst thing about it was that Ves had no means of conveying his suspicions to the Mech Corps or anyone else back home. If he had access to his personal comm and the System, he might have been able to covertly send a message to the right people, but without his toys, he possessed very little means to halt this dormant but threatening crisis.
"It’s like boarding onto a passenger ship from orbit, only to find out that she is slowly descending into atmosphere and will eventually crash onto the surface of a planet. It’s a one way trip, and all the escape pods are tightly guarded by the whole crew who are intent on riding this ship to her final destination."
If Ves threw all caution to the wind, he might be able to storm the communications center in the restricted area with the help of the Amastendira. The dematerialized weapon was his only hidden asset, and could deal an awesome amount of damage, enough to pull off a surprise attack, but only once.
He quickly discarded the idea of pulling off such a hairbrained gambit. The Vandals would surely kill him even if he got his message out.
He was like a fly who got entangled in the web of a spider. Colonel Lowenfield would never let anyone go, least of all Ves. His only choice was to wait for an opportunity.
The next couple of days, Ves continued to act as if he hadn’t’t realized anything. He played the dutiful mech designer who occasionally assisted the planners in getting the right supplies to the right people.
The overhauled mechs took shape. With almost all of the mechs in the fleet configured anew, the anticipation building up inside everyone’s heart had almost reached their bursting point.
The mech pilots of the Inheritors particularly enjoyed the rare enhancements, even if most of it turned out to be illusionary. Ves personally paid a visit to the revamped mechs and found that though extremely weak, they at least held a shadow of a presence in the imaginary realm.
While it hardly made a difference, the Inheritor pilots celebrated even a minor increase in performance. How could they not, when they had been deprived for so long?
Still, many mech pilots were rearing up to go against the Vesians. Morale couldn’t get any higher. They needed an outlet soon, or else this temporary increase in battle spirit would be wasted.
"What’s it like for the Wolf Mother to enter into an active battlezone?" Ves asked Alloc one day during breakfast.
"That rarely happens, but this isn’t a usual raid." Alloc grunted as he formed his thoughts. "It’s nerve-wracking. Even if the chances of getting directly attacked are low, it still happened a couple of times in the past. Stealth technology being what it is, there are many ways the Vesians can circumvent our patrols and sneak up to the hull of our factory ship."
Ves knew how different stealth technologies worked when utilized by mechs, but he didn’t have a good grasp on their effectiveness in spaceborn combat.
"Is it easy for an inflitrator ship to come close?"
It’s easier to approach a small ship than a larger one. It depends on the scanners, really. The Wolf Mother possesses an excellent array of sensors, but most are geared towards detecting minerals. While they can still be repurposed to detect approaching infiltrators, most of them are constructed out of non-metallic composites. Together with other stealth technologies, and it becomes damn hard to spot any infiltrator trying to come up alongside our ship."
That explained the ease in which some of the last ships Ves had travelled upon had been boarded so easily.
"Is there a downside to this?"
"Just like with mechs, an exterior geared for stealth is paper thin. They don’t make for very good armor, frankly. A single rifleman mech can blow them out of space within seconds. We’ve taken out more infiltrator ships than we can count. There’s an easy method to counteract their approach if we make the right preparations."
The countermeasure turned out to be the spread of very fine microparticles. These little bits of metallic dust would constantly be fanned out from the Wolf Mother in an all-encompassing sphere. While the cloud of microparticles would rapidly dilute the further away from the Wolf Mother they traveled, within a certain range they remained highly effective in revealing the presence of anything material trying to approach the factory ship.
"That’s surprisingly low-tech." Ves commented. "It’s like throwing powder in the air and looking at them carefully as they float in the air. As soon as something invisible bumps into them, they’ll leave an discrepancy in the uniform cloud."
"As long as it works, it doesn’t matter how simple the idea is. In truth, there’s plenty of downsides to this method. First, we have to stockpile a lot of materials to keep pumping out these microparticles. Second, the effective range is very limited. Beyond a kilometer or more, the cloud is so diluted that we won’t be able to track any approaches being made by smaller vessels such as stealthed boarding torpedoes."
More advanced states used more sophisticated means to detect the stealthy buggers, but those weren’t anything the Vandals could get their hands on. They had to settle on the spaceship equivalent of throwing powder in the air.
At least Ves received some reassurance that trouble wouldn’t likely come and knock at the Wolf Mother’s door. As a factory ship, she could hardly take on a determined force of enemy mechs.
As the time of the operation became imminent, Professor Velten called every mech designer for a final briefing. Everyone filed into the conference room and took their seats. Ves and Iris automatically sat together at the far end of the room.
"Everyone is here. Good." The old lady nodded sternly. "Now, since the main fleet is at the cusp of beginning the operation, I am finally allowed to lift its curtain."
A projection shimmered in front of them. It depicted a fairly standard binary star system. One star consisted of a yellow dwarf while the other one was a much-weaker red dwarf. Both suns exhibited normal behavior for stars and orbited rather tightly around each other. Several planets orbited beyond both stars in roughly circular orbits.
"This is the Detemen System, a moderate industrial locus of the Imodris Duchy. It is ruled by two noble Houses, each of them occupying an inhabited planet each."
"Detemen II is smaller but closer to the twin suns. It’s a hothouse that’s barely habitable to humans, but is a hotbed to local industries due to their proximity to such a massive heat source. If you look at the artificial satellites around orbit, they all consist of highly automated solar forges. They present Detemen II with a fairly slow but highly efficient method of refining ores into usable materials. If more heat is required, they will make use of the starforge that occasionally orbits in between the twin stars."
One mech designer raised a hand. "How much ore is being processed at this planet?"
"A considerable amount, enough to supply the neighboring industrial planets with a portion of their material needs. The Detemen System sits at a strategic route that makes it a convenient stop for traders looking to refine their raw materials and decrease the amount of mass they are hauling from planet to planet."
"Ma’am, are there any valuable exotics being processed at Detemen II?"
"Sadly, no. The System is too unimportant and doesn’t offer any facilities that are capable enough to work with highly reactive exotics." Professor Velten pointed at the projection and highlighted the starforge. "This is the only location in the system that holds a considerable amount of exotics. However, its proximity to the sun makes it very risky to relieve it of its booty. As of this point, we do not have any mech in our roster that can withstand the heat long enough to approach this satellite."
Ves stood up to ask his own question. "Professor, pardon my question, but what makes Detemen II valuable then? There doesn’t appear to be much production going on at the surface of this heat-ridden planet."
"You raise a valid point." The professor switched the projection of the planet into a wireframe model. At one area on the surface, a large maze of tunnels stretched tens of kilometers underground. "This is the true jewel of Detemen II. When the Vesians terraformed the planet, they learned that it contains a trace amount of exotics. Under the heat of the twin suns and some special circumstances unique to Detemen II, they found out that these exotics are duplicating themselves from the regular soil of the planet."
That caused everyone to raise their eyebrows. What Velten referred to was basically a renewable exotics mine!
"I know what you are thinking. It’s true. It is a low-grade exotics mine. However, it only produced a moderate amount of junk exotics each year, which is hardly anything to get excited over. Nevertheless, it produced enough wealth that Detemen II’s stockpile should be of substantial value. This stockpile is our first primary target."
"The first primary objective of the Flagrant Vandals is to raid the renewable mine’s stockpile. It will be tightly defended, but if the Vesian rebels deliver on their promises, the actual amount of opposition we will face will be severely less than at their peak."
"Why are we going after a stockpile of junk exotics? Won’t we gain much more out of this raid by attacking the industries on the surface?"
Velten shook her head. "While we would be able to obtain more valuable goods for their size and weight if we attack the individual refineries and manufacturing complexes on the surface of Detemen II, it will take far too much time to overrun each company force and dig the loot out of their well-defended tunnels."
The projection shimmered again, this time revealing a loose schedule.
"According to our projections, once the Detemen System is attacked, enemy reinforcements will arrive in less than four days, depending on how much interference the rebels can throw up at their origin systems. Speed is of the essence here. With the time we’ll waste on travelling in-system and other maneuvers, we don’t have the time to care about the meager industries on Detemen II. Instead, we’ll split up our fleet and send half of it to Detement IV."
"Detemen IV?"
"Yes, Detemen IV, ruled by a different noble House. Further away from the twin suns, the planet exhibits a much more moderate global climate. This has led to a boom in population and an increase in development. In practice, many of the materials being refined at Detemen II are being funneled towards Detemen IV for feeding the production of end products such as mechs and consumer goods."
Detemen IV was actually smaller than Detemen II, but nevertheless boasted a lot more inhabitants, though not to the extent of a trade nexus like Bentheim.
"As you can see, Detemen IV is nothing special. The only thing to note is its three small moons. Each of them are occupied by varying powers. One of which is the MTA, which will not be playing role in the coming conflict."
As an organization that acted beyond the interests of a single state, the MTA maintained a standpoint of absolute neutrality against any wars between states. Therefore, they gladly stood out of the way as long as nothing more than a stray projectile hit their assets.
"The other sun is turned into a fortress. I’ll admit that its defenses are extremely formidable, to the extent of being able to repel a full mech division if fully manned. The caveat here is the latter. There aren’t enough men and mechs to fully staff this incredibly sturdy defensive bulwark. In fact, due to the war, the local nobles brought all of their most potent mech forces to the front, leaving behind a garrison of second-strong mechs and mech pilots."
Exacerbating their awful state was that the base commander of the lunar fortress resorted to staffing the undermanned fortress with auxiliary infantry and tank regiments. The same regiments that had been subverted by the rebels.
"Safe to say, this moon won’t be a problem." Velten summed up before turning to the final moon. "The third moon is a mech research complex. It holds a small gathering of Vesian design teams that are developing a number of spaceborn mech designs. Due to its lack of secrecy, not a lot of valuable research is being performed at this research complex. Nevertheless, if we can overrun this base and steal any data banks that they haven’t managed to wreck, we can glean lots of valuable intelligence that will help us determine the weaknesses of their current and future mech models."
Ves raised his hand again. "If the Vandals attack the research base, what will be done with the mech designers?"
Iris spoke out this time instead of the professor. "The Vesian Revolutionary Front and our partners will take them into custody as long as they surrender. We have... ways of making them work for us."
That didn’t sound very pleasant, but at least it beat outright slaughter. Ves heard too many stories of vengeful Vesians massacring hundreds of mech designers whenever they sniffed out a Mech Corps research base. He had no doubt that the Mech Corps did the same in kind.
While Ves was no saint, as a mech designer himself, he didn’t wish for his fellows on the opposite side of the war to be condemned to an early grave. He looked at Iris and smiled before he turned back to the professor.
"As much as these three moons look interesting, the main prizes are on the surface of Detemen IV. Similar to Bentheim, it is host to a moderate sprawl of manufacturing complexes and other industries. A substantial amount of mechs that is seen throughout the Imodris Duchy originate from these factories."
"Professor, won’t we face the same dilemma as on Detemen II? All of the manufacturing complexes are tough nuts to crack."
"You would think so if you assume that both planets are run in the same fashion. In reality, they differ substantially."
A secondary projection popped up that detailed the noble Houses that ruled these two planets.
"Detemen II is ruled by Count Reizen of House Jier. This House is a young one and only control several rural planets and star systems around the Detemen System. Count Reizen is the head of the House, and Detemen II is the seat of their power. This causes the count to value this system highly. The main issue of the count is that it is a very unbearable planet to live on. In order to retain as many commoners as possible, he is treating them fairly well. The local rebel movements only have a weak grip on this planet."
That contrasted sharply with Detemen IV.
"On the other hand, Detemen IV has a lot more going for it. It boasts a temperate climate, a high level of development and at least ten times more inhabitants than the second planet from the binary stars. Nonetheless, it is spectacularly badly run by House Eneqqin."
The face of a sneering noble appeared next to House Eneqqin’s sigil.
"Javier of House Eneqqin is the sole heir to the Count Loqer of House Eneqqin. Lacking any competition for the right to inherit Loqer’s position, Lord Javier has turned into a spoiled brat, typical of the Vesians. Loqer thought to temper his only offspring by chucking him onto Detemen IV and making him responsible for running the somewhat prosperous planet."
Everyone could predict how that turned out. The Vesian nobles were all the same.
Professor Velten smirked. "Lord Javier has of course made a mess of the planet. Detemen IV’s GDP has nosedived by twelve percent in the last five years, its cost of living has gone up and many workers are being laid off. This is a breeding ground for resentment and has bolstered the local rebel movement from an afterthought into a genuine threat. The spark has been lit. We only need to set it off."
She began to describe some of the broad strokes of what the Vandals had in store for Detemen IV. Once half of the Vandal fleet slipped into orbit over the planet, the rebels should have already launched their own attacks from space and on the ground.
With the lunar fortress and much of the other defenses loyal to House Eneqqin tied up or taken out of commission, the Vandals would act as the coup-de-grace and tip control of the planet away from Lord Javier’s forces. Once that has happened, the rest of the planet would be free for the Vandals to pillage.
While it would still be troublesome to crack open the manufacturing complexes defended by company forces, much of those places had been infiltrated by the rebels as well. The Vandals would have a much easier time with breaking them open with some help from the inside.
Throughout it all, Ves kept wondering what the rebels got out of this death and destruction. He held no illusions that the Vandals would show mercy and be discriminate in their fire. He quietly turned to Iris and whispered his question.
"It’s because they really want to get rid of Lord Javier." She whispered back. "The heir is a recalcitrant tyrant, but the worst thing about it is that he’s shrewd enough to stay within his limits. He never does anything too outrageous that causes Count Loqer to call him back. He’s also chummy with the industrialists who own property on Detemen IV. Though they aren’t exactly happy with the worsening conditions of the planet, Javier’s ties with them has caused them to stay put and do nothing."
This Javier fellow sounded like a real piece of work. "So the rebels agree for us to turn their entire planet into a living hell for a few days just to open up an opportunity to get rid of Lord Javier?"
"Oh, they don’t want to get rid of him. They want to drag him out of the palace, bring him out in front of a crowd, and tear him apart from limb to limb. The amount of animosity they hold for him is very considerate. If it takes a foreign mech regiment to allow them the opportunity to get at Javier, then they’ll gladly anticipate your arrival."
Lord Javier thought himself impregnable. Why wouldn’t he? With his powerful daddy count covering his political hide, he had nothing to fear. The industrialists would be kept happy as long as he didn’t make too much of a mess of things and while the rebels formed a nuisance, they could never defeat the forces at his disposal.
"Our goals here on Detemen IV is to identify the most promising sites and stockpiles to raid, and to assist the rebels in storming the palace in order to root out Lord Javier. Before you think that the latter is just a cursory priority, Colonel Lowenfield has promised the rebels that they will go above and beyond to capture the scion of House Eneqqin. Failure to apprehend him will lead to a severe strain in our relationships with the VRF and other rebel movements."
After setting out the outline of the upcoming operation, Professor Velten finally turned to what their roles should be. "There are various areas where capable mech designers like you are needed. As I’ve mentioned before, the Vandal fleet will split in two. One detachment will attack Detemen II, while the other one will assault Detement IV."
Due to the unevenness of their strengths, one detachment would be larger than the other one.
"Since Detemen II is projected to be less of a challenge to overcome, the Wolf Mother will stick to the Vandal detachment that is responsible for raiding its renewable mine stockpile and its solar forges. The other Vandal detachment will go on to attack Detemen IV’s moons and its surface industries."
The professor proceeded to allocate about a third of the mech designers in the conference room to the Detemen II detachment, including one Journeyman Mech Designer. Their jobs were comparatively easier, but they would still have plenty to do since they had fewer numbers.
Because the Wolf Mother stuck close to the Detemen II detachment, these lucky fellows didn’t have to leave this ship. The same wouldn’t be the case for the other mech designers.
When the professor allocated the rest of the mech designers to the Detemen IV detachment, Ves unfortunately fell within this category. He along with the rest who had been called up would have to leave the Wolf Mother and board one of the many combat carriers that ferried over mechs to assault Lord Javier’s fief.
"Unlike the low-tier mech designers assigned to the maintenance departments, you will not have to follow behind the mechs as they deploy to the surface. We can leave the task of helping with setting up forward bases that will facilitate in sending plundered loot back to the surface to their expert hands."
That left one worry off of their chests.
"Nevertheless, I expect that your expertise will be sorely needed when we take over the research base and when deciding which sites we should raid. The most of you will do your work from the safety of the command centers aboard the combat carriers."
Ves followed after Alloc and stepped on board the shuttle. The Vandal fleet had finally arrived at the edge of the Detemen System. Throughout the haste of making the final deployments, Ves only caught a smattering of what went on.
Apparently, things somewhat went according to plan.
The rebels successfully struck the completely complacent defenders of Detemen II and Detemen IV. Supposedly loyal auxiliary regiments fell within moments as the traitors within their ranks completely turned against their clueless loyalist comrades. Those that remained took stock of the remaining weapons and began to sow an enormous amount of chaos.
Right now, the Detemen System hosted three different battle fronts.
First up was Detemen II, which the rebels hadn’t been able to deal too much damage. House Jier held the second planet from the twin suns in a tight grip, and they never mistreated their inhabitants. This was why the rebels hadn’t been able to deploy too many of their assets at this planet.
Detemen IV on the other hand fell into a different situation. The resentment against Lord Javier had reached a boiling point, thus a large portion of the local inhabitants rose up as well and rioted on the streets. This completely disordered the planet and caused the defenders to button down in their bases and fight back against the traitor forces that took over the auxiliary regiments.
The third front consisted of the battle in space. A garrison fleet placed in the Detemen System by the Imodris Duchy normally handled all of the deep space patrols. Due to the relative security of the system as well as the pressing need for war assets at the front, the garrison had been left with a number of combat carriers and around three-hundred spaceborn mechs.
Still, defeating three-hundred mechs when they had the run of the entire system was extremely difficult. Keeping them alive and unharmed would be very detrimental for the Vandal fleets, as they would certainly nip at their heels and harass them from the flanks.
Thus, a plan had been set in motion to pull them into a trap. The rebels employed an elaborate distraction with many cheap carriers converted into supposed pirate ships.
The garrison fleet successfully took the bait and pursued the pirates. This drew them away from their bases and towards the edge of the system, right into the jaws of the Vandals.
By the time the garrison fleet realized that they had been duped, it was too late to redirect their momentum away from the Vandal fleet. It took too much time to change their course and shift their huge bulks back to the inner system.
"Strap yourself tight." Alloc said as he sat down on a crash seat and let the straps buckle him tight. "Even if battle is a couple of hours away, you might never know what the Vesians planted here."
"Understood, sir."
Ves sat next to Alloc and after bucking in, he looked at the handful of other servicemen that transferred out of the Wolf Mother. The Vandal fleet had made a lot of reassignments, but it wasn’t safe to send out a shuttle during FTL. They could only wait until they transitioned back into realspace before they could send out their transfers.
Now that they entered into a hostile star system, it was as if a switch had flipped in everyone’s minds. The Vandals stopped messing around or display any signs of insubordination. They became highly focused and professional, just as Ves had imagined them to be before he arrived in their midst.
The shuttle lifted off from the shuttle hangar of the Wolf Mother and traversed a short distance towards one of the combat carriers heading towards Detemen IV.
"Ves."
He turned to Alloc. "Yes?"
"Your record states that you took part in the fight for the Glowing Planet. Is that true?"
"Pretty much. I was there from the start, and witnessed lots of fighting, sometimes up close. It’s not something I’m eager to repeat."
"You’ve seen more action than me. Besides a couple of mech duels in an arena, I’ve never seen a real battle between mechs up close. I’ve always stayed aboard the ships looking at live or recorded footage."
"Recordings usually have very high fidelity, sir. There is no disadvantage in studying the way mechs fight through a projector."
"I used to believe that’s the case, but after seeing you at work, I’m not so sure." Alloc sighed. "You’re a conundrum, you know that? You’re a decade younger than me, but sometimes you make me feel as if I’m the Apprentice and you are the Journeyman. It’s not only your wealth of knowledge that astounds me, but also the amount of consideration you have for mech pilots and their mechs. Your advocacy for the Inheritor mechs is like a gust of fresh air in our stale and stagnant design teams."
What was Ves supposed to say to that? "I appreciate your compliments, sir. It’s not that hard to show a little more appreciation for the mechs we work with on a daily basis."
"It’s not just your consideration that’s notable compared to the rest of us. You have a strange way with mechs. It’s as if everything you touch turns into something exotic."
"I like to think of it as bringing mechs to life." Ves boldly said on an impulse. Though it strayed a little close to the secret of the X-Factor, he had already become well-known for this saying due to the rising profile of the Living Mech Corporation. "My fundamental philosophy on mechs is that they are more than machines, and deserve to be treated as such."
Alloc fell silent for a moment. "Interesting. I never looked at mechs in that light. You look at mechs and see life. You draw up a design and see the potential of life. It’s different for me. My main focus lies in programming the software of my designs, so I have always considered mechs to be blank slates. They start out as nothing, but as I fill in their programming, the details begin to fill in. Once I’m done, I’ve created a perfect whole design."
Alloc’s perspective differed substantially in that he treated his designs as puppets to be pulled by his strings. His puppets were never meant to think or feel for themselves, and they did not deserve any special treatment.
Ves couldn’t say which one was better. They both excelled in different circumstances. A programmer like Alloc was used to exerting a high degree of control over his creations. Ves on the other hand left a lot of autonomy to the mech pilot and whatever image took root in his mech.
Their shuttle quickly arrived at its destination and docked inside the hangar of a combat carrier called the Stubby Growler.
The Growler was a hefty combat carrier that conveyed around fifty spaceborn mechs and spares. Designed as a commander center, her class held fewer mechs than the other classes of combat carriers in the Vandal fleet, but made up for it in the thickness of her armor and her powerful means of communications.
"Major Verle would like to see you." A junior officer greeted them as the two mech designers stepped onto the deck of the crowded hangar bay. "Please follow."
They jostled their way through mech technicians performing last-minute repair jobs and mechs slowly walking away from the repair bays and into a position where they could launch at a moment’s notice.
From the activity in this hangar bay, Ves got a good read on the attitude of the Vandals. Everyone radiated eagerness in a way that made him feel as if he was in the middle of a pack of wolves drooling at a juicy prey off in the distance. The mech pilots in particular displayed barely checked aggression. They couldn’t wait to dive into the Vesians and tear their mechs apart.
They exited the hangar bay and climbed up a couple of decks. After traversing a couple of winded corridors and passing through a number of security checks, they entered what appeared to be a command center. Over two-dozen specialists sat behind a number of varied consoles, and they managed everything from sensors to mech deployment.
Guided by the young officer, they approached the grey-haired officer looking down on the central plot from an elevated seat. The man obviously possessed the physique of a mech pilot and looked as if he could still fight on for a couple of decades more.
"Mr. Brandstad, good to see you again!"
"Major Verle, it’s a pleasure."
"And who is this young fellow?"
"This is Ves Larkinson, an Apprentice Mech Designer under my wing."
"Larkinson, you say? Is he related to...?"
Here we go again, Ves sighed. "I am part of the famous Larkinson Family, sir."
Everyone he met so far treated the Larkinson name with respect. Not so for Major Verle. As soon as Ves confirmed his lineage, the Major’s face turned flat. "I suggest you take your cues from Mr. Brandstad and stay out of our way. We cannot afford any distractions during the heat of battle. Understood?"
"Understood, sir!"
Did the man got duped by a Larkinson or something? Or did he know the true story behind Colonel Lowenfield’s exile, and felt indignant on behalf of his superior?
Both Ves and Alloc sat down on a pair of basic seats meant for guests. They quietly observed the proceedings as the Vandal fleet closed in on the hapless garrison fleet that had strayed too far from its base to call for reinforcements.
"What’s our job here?" Ves whispered to Alloc.
"We’re here to serve as technical advisors. We assist Major Verle in identifying the weaknesses of enemy mechs and answer any questions he might pose to us as long as it falls under our area of expertise. However, don’t mistake this assignment as a way to command over mechs. We are not here to usurp Major Verle’s authority."
"Does this mean we stay shut most of the time?"
"There’s definitely a lot of waiting involved. Unless it’s truly urgent, don’t speak up unless our advice is called for. I expect we won’t be needed during the upcoming battle against the garrison fleet. It’s when our detachment enters into the orbit of Detemen IV that we’ll be needed. In the meantime, I suggest you while away your time by studying up on the data that is made available to us. There’s a projector embedded inside the armrest. Squeeze this part here to turn it on."
Ves did as he was told and a small projected terminal appeared in front of his face. As he explored its interface, he found out that the terminal mainly presented sensor readings to him. The AIs in charge of interpreting the raw data already translated the observed mechs in the distance into a number of familiar Vesian designs.
"First, study the sensor readings and double-check the designs. Many designs used by the Vesians are continually developing, just like our three designs, so there will always be minor and major variations between the iterations. Before the Vandals enter into battle, we have to make sure that we pinned down the exact versions and provide accurate estimates of their specs."
"Understood. I’m on it."
Ves hadn’t expected to do something like this, but he couldn’t complain. At least he wasn’t one of those poor bums who would soon be deployed to the surface of the moons and Detemen IV.
Due to his extensive knowledge, Ves rapidly adjusted to his job of analyzing the mechs identified by the AIs. The enemy fleet had finally found out that they had been lured into a trap. Their carriers frantically turned around to head back to the lunar fortress above Detemen IV, but they couldn’t beat the awesome amount of inertia that slowly brought them to their inevitable doom.
At this moment of time, the Vandal fleet hadn’t split up into two detachments yet. Colonel Lowenfield wanted to keep her assets together and crush the Vesian garrison fleet in a single blow.
Unfortunately, the enemy did the smart thing.
"The garrison fleet is splitting up!"
Battles between two hostile fleets had always been rare even during the golden age of warships. Space was too vast and ships moved at a snail’s pace compared to the scale of an average star system. Though technology advanced and ships these days traversed a lot faster than their predecessors from the Age of Conquest, it was safe to say not a lot of battles actually took place.
The main reason why was because fleets often saw each other coming. Space was empty, so therefore an approaching enemy would always be spotted many hours before they actually arrived at their targets.
Accounting for the lag due to the speed of light needing time to travel from the outer system to the inner system couldn’t be applied. A well-defended star system was littered with sensors that relayed their up-to-date readings to a hidden quantum entanglement node that instantly sent the observations to the inner system.
Basically, surprise attacks were rare and hard to pull off. Most battles in space happened because the two sides thought they both stood a chance of winning it. Once a side believed that they didn’t stand a chance of winning the impending battle, they wouldn’t hesitate to cut and run.
"Cowards!" Major Verle swore and slammed his fist against the armrest of his command chair. A myriad of projections appeared before his eyes. He studied them rapidly before issuing new commands.
In the meantime, the flagship of the Vandals relayed new deployments. The Vandals would split off as many ships as it took to run down each escaping Vesian vessel and crush them into bits. Due to the differences in speed, the Vandals would still be able to go after the individual ships. It would just take a lot more time and bring some of their ships off-course.
"The Vesians are delaying the inevitable." Alloc explained to Ves. Though Ves had seen a lot more action on the ground, Alloc had sat in a command center for more than two-dozen times in his career. "Splitting up their fleet is a test of our priorities. While the Vesians are letting us mop them up one by one, they’re forcing us to spread out mech forces thin. One of our combat carriers won’t be enough to defeat one of the Vesian combat carriers without sustaining severe losses."
"So we are sending out two ships in pursuit of each Vesian ship?"
"Exactly. That’s the only way we can insure a crushing victory with very few losses."
Already, the Vandals started to redeploy. Many combat carriers split up from the main fleet and spread out into pairs. Each pair moved to intercept the frantic Vesian combat carriers.
While their defeat wasn’t in question, the delay they imposed on their timetables meant that the Vandals suffered a very consequential setback. They only had four days at most to accomplish their objective and be on their way out before the Vesian reinforcements arrived.
"How long will we be delayed if we try to stick to the plan?"
"Not sure." Alloc grunted. "I’m not an expert in complex space maneuvers. At a guess, I would say that if the Vandals are keen on sticking together, we might be delayed by as much as half a day."
This placed a decent amount of pressure over Colonel Lowenfield’s shoulders. Either she would wait until they completely chased down the Vesians and annihilated them, or she would decide to split up the fleet into three.
Two of the detachments would move towards the two inhabited planets as planned, but the third detachment that consisted of the chasers would linger in the outer system until they completely mopped up the garrison fleet. After that, they should return to the other two detachments as fast as possible, but due to the differences in relative speeds, it would take a while for them to catch up.
At the very least, the stragglers wouldn’t be able to assist the other two detachments as they initiated their battles against the remnant loyalist forces on those planets.
Ves did not envy Lowenfield’s position. Both choices came with a lot of risks that could make or break this bold assault.
"What would you choose to do, sir?"
"I’d take the safe option and stick together. There’s no guarantee that the intelligence that the rebels have gathered is accurate. The Vesians might have buried a hidden base somewhere, and offer a stiffer resistance than we expected."
Too many things could go wrong during this operation. What Alloc mentioned was only one of the ways in which the battle could turn against their favor. Ves thought back on the rebels and questioned whether they would truly be able to suppress the loyalist forces that were keen to root them out. It was an unquestioned fact that the rebels would never be able to subvert the mech pilots. They enjoyed too much privilege to turn against the local regimes.
Eventually, Colonel Lowenfield came to a decision. New orders showed up which stated that the rest of the Vandal fleet would continue according to schedule, but with around six-hundred Vandal mechs less.
The Stubby Growler took on an important role within second detachment that headed towards Detemen IV. The command center buzzed and grew busy as they tried to coordinate their formation after the loss of vital spaceborn assets. Missing a few hundred mechs put a severe dent into their defensive envelope.
As the larger offshoot of the Vandals raced towards Detemen IV, Ves and Alloc paid a keen amount of attention to the relentless chase.
The garrison fleet might have been able to divert some of the Vandals, but they payed a grievous price for it. With each ship looking out for themselves, they all faced twice as much mechs.
For the first time in his life, Ves finally witnessed the Inheritors in action in a live battle. Even as he kept his eyes on the live footage, he also kept analyzing the readings that continued to pour in. With his help, the AIs refined their identification and determined the exact mech models used by the Vesian garrison fleet.
"They’re goners for sure." Alloc remarked as he beheld the list of mech models. "All of these are second-line designs. They’re cheap and haven’t been updated in years."
The battles that ensued underscored the disparity in strength. Each fleeing Vesian combat carrier fell behind in terms of the quantity and quality of mechs they could deploy.
The Vandals employed their advantages as hard as possible. Hordes of Inheritors sprung from the hangar bays and raced around the the trajectory of their prey, seeking to cut off its escape route.
Their extremely high speeds allowed them to outpace the best efforts of the fleeing ships. In the meantime, the Hellcats accompanied by a diverse menagerie of mechs stolen from Vesian factories and depots harried their rear.
Pincered from behind and in front, the ships futilely tried to wriggle out their way, but failed.
"The first ship is already going down!"
The first battle that broke out ended the fastest as well. The Inheritors straightforwardly slammed into the formation of of the Vesian garrison mechs just as they focused on repelling the Hellcats and the other Vandal mechs.
It was then that Ves witnessed the true value of the Inheritors. If given enough assistance, the Inheritors wouldn’t suffer too much as they approached their targets. Once they got into melee range, they would make mincemeat out of practically every spaceborn mechs.
Only a handful of knights and other melee mechs lasted a little longer against the Inheritors, but the fall of their ranged mechs quickly led to being piled up multitudes of Inheritors.
"They’re like a hive of angry bees." Ves softly uttered. "Individually, they’re weak. Together, they are strong."
Their speed and swarming potential lent themselves well in these pursuits. Multitudes of Vesian carriers self-destructed as soon as it became clear that they wouldn’t get away. Naturally, their captains issued evacuation orders beforehand. Thousands of escape pods flung into every direction just before the carriers exploded.
Ves keenly looked on to see what the Vandals decided to do with the escape pods. Would they capture the fleeing Vesians, shoot at their defenseless pods or leave them be?
Major Verle sent out a message to another commander. "Ignore the escape pods. We don’t have time to process them. Get back to us as soon as possible."
As the first battle ended in a tedious but predictable victory, the second detachment had almost reached the vicinity of Detemen IV. More information started to pour into their terminals as their rebel allies supplied more data over their quantum entanglement nodes.
The current status looked worse than expected.
[MTA FORTRESS: PASSIVE. NO SIGNS OF INTERVENTION.]
[LUNAR FORTRESS: UPRISING QUELLED. REBELLION SUFFERED HEAVY CASUALTIES. MANY VESIAN MECHS REMAIN OPERATIONAL. SUPPLIES DESTROYED OR SABOTAGED.]
[MECH RESEARCH BASE: INTACT. NO ATTEMPTS MADE TO OVERRUN THE RESEARCH BASE DUE TO INABILITY TO OVERRUN THE LUNAR FORTRESS. DEFENSES ARE LIGHT, BUT PREPARED.]
[DETEMEN IV: HEAVY RIOTING IN EVERY POPULATION CENTER. MANY MECH REGIMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN DOWN, BUT REBEL FORCES ARE EXHAUSTED. CHAOS AND ANARCHY IS SPREADING DUE TO FAILING SERVICES. LORD JAVIER HAS GONE INTO HIDING. UNABLE TO ASCERTAIN LOCATION, BUT EVERY SHUTTLE OR SHIP THAT ATTEMPTS TO ASCEND IS SHOT DOWN.]
The news spread to the rest of the command center as well, causing everyone to frown. Major Verle chewed over the issue for a moment before hardening his eyes. "If we delay even once, we’ll rapidly fall behind, and it will be impossible to meet our goals set out for this operation. Continue forward and maintain course!"
A new series of orders spread to the mechs that would soon be deployed to finish the jobs that the rebels hadn’t managed to complete. Though the rebels ran out steam a lot faster than anticipated, the Flagrant Vandals had never counted on their allies to do the heavy lifting.
What the rebels accomplished so up to this point gave the vandals enough of an opening to drive through a wedge. Their first concern was the lunar fortress on the second moon.
"Mr. Brandstad!"
"Yes, Major?!"
"Go over the battle logs the rebels has sent us and determine the weaknesses of the surviving Vesian mechs. Find a way to topple them in a single blow!"
"On it!"
Ves naturally joined Alloc into scouring through the logs and battle footage. They encountered a lot of difficulties in this because the rebels hadn’t exactly been stellar at maintaining logs. Many of the pieces they sent to the Vandals came in fragments, as some of the data had to be salvaged from corpses of wrecks.
Nevertheless, the footage painted a fairly simple picture of the defending forces. "They started out with half a mech regiment of House Eneqqin’s household troops. They sustained a lot of losses, but at least five to six-hundred mechs remain operational. The outer fortifications are all intact, but many of the turrets have been taken out of action."
"What of their mech composition?"
"They are predominately lunar gravity-optimized landbound mechs. They have a heavy propensity for rifleman mechs, which are ideal for defending a static fortification. The good news is that their primary weapons are equally divided between laser rifles and ballistic rifles. The rebels managed to destroy most of their ammunition stockpiles, so their ballistic rifleman mechs will only have a few magazines left each."
That still left them with a defensive advantage. With the absence of the mechs that chased after the garrison fleeet, Major Verle had no choice but to deploy his remaining forces against the lunar base with much less of an advantage in numbers than he anticipated.
Though the defenders sounded like they were at the end of their ropes, cornered rats had a tendency to lash out hard.
Ignoring them exposed the rear of the Vandals to a surviving Vesian element, but overcoming them required the Vandals to pay a price that it could hardly stomach. Either way, Major Verle was in a very difficult position.
The assault on the Detemen System had gone off on a rocky start. Nevertheless, the appearance of the 6th Flagrant Vandals in what the Vesia Kingdom considered its heartland came as a huge shock to both sides of the war.
The Mech Corps barely exerted any oversight on the Vandals. Whenever someone in high command got reminded of their existence, they brushed the motley mech regiment off as a bunch of cowardly raiders too scared to man up and attack the Mech Legion.
Everyone had made a serious mistake in underestimating the Flagrant Vandals.
Living up to the name of their mech regiment, the Flagrant Vandals smashed everyone’s expectations and struck at one of the Imodris Duchy’s more significant industrial systems.
The damage already dealt to its infrastructure came as a heavy blow, but the Vandals had only just begun. The local rebels did most of the damage so far, and now it was time for the Vandals to deliver on their promises.
The attack on Detemen II still needed time to forment. The first detachment of the Vandal fleet approached the smaller planet and its valuable solar foundries with greedy anticipation. Count Reizen rallied every household troop of House Jier to form a line of defense around the most important asset of the planet, its renewable exotics mine.
This left much of the planet undefended, including its various complexes and the solar foundries spinning in orbit. Count Reizen made the determination that he couldn’t spread his limited household troops to defend everything, so he concentrated them all to form a deterrent.
Basically, the count told the incoming Vandals to wreck everything else but the possession he prized the most.
Naturally, many industrialists did not agree to become House Reizen’s sacrificial lambs. Due to panic and indecision, they rebelled or sowed chaos on Detemen II, which ironically paved the way for the incoming Vandals.
Count Reizen and the people of the Detemen System couldn’t be blamed for their confusing responses. Complacency lay at the heart of their incompetence. Even as the Bright Republic and the Vesia Kingdom battled at the frontlines, the Mech Corps never raided as far as Imodris.
While the border systems endured so many raids that they responded like a well-oiled machine when faced with another incursion, the complacent people of Detemen II and IV had never dealt with such a massive attack.
"Rise up, comrades!" A ferocious woman stood atop a wrecked laser turret as she bared her rifle in the air. "The time has come to pull down the nobles from their lofty perches!"
In the hot and sweltering environment of Detemen II, half of her crowd wore thin climate suits that allowed them to stay cool. Both suited and unsuited people cheered and raised their arms, though their numbers and enthusiasm fell a little short.
The rally hadn’t lasted more than a couple of minutes before a series of thuds started transmitting from the ground.
"Footsteps... mechs! Incoming mechs!"
"It’s a company mech! Run!"
No one kid themselves into thinking they could fight against a machine of war. The fear of mechs had set in deep among the population. Before the rebel woman could persuade her crowd otherwise, her audience had completely scurried away before the Jier mechs even arrived.
Seeing that the situation went to hell pretty fast, the rebel woman abandoned her elevated perch and ran away for safety as well. "Bunch of spineless cowards!"
Unlike the haphazard unrest wracking Detemen II, the situation on Detement IV deteriorated into full-blown anarchy.
"Hahahaha! We’re rich!" A man shouted as he looted a luxury store inside a mall. Though he had no idea how he could sell his ill-gotten loot of luxury clothes, just the thought of obtaining decades-worth his salary in booty made him delirious.
Just as the handful of men ran towards their aircar, a volley of laser and projectile fire spat in their direction. The aim of the assailants was atrocious, but the sheer volume of fire eventually struck down all of the looters.
A swarm of teenagers emerged from the corners and dashed towards the fallen men. They quickly deprived them of their loot and made their way out, giggling and laughing all the while.
Elsewhere, two company forces guarding two adjacent manufacturing complexes clashed against each other in a full-blown battle.
"Stop this madness!" The commander of the defense force at Westcott Machinery Supply broadcasted in the open. The man piloted his knight to withstand another barrage of incoming fire for his ranged mechs. "The rebels are burning everything down and the Brighters are about to make landfall! This is no time to settle our grudges!"
A maddened laughter escaped the speakers of a gaudily-decorated cannoneer mech from United Alloy Supplies. It blasted its ballistic cannon indiscriminately towards the Westcott forces.
"I always hated seeing you parade your mechs in front of our faces! Now, I finally get the opportunity to do you Westcott goons in!"
"You won’t get away with this!" The Westcott commander shouted back as his knight mech bashed its way to the front and slammed its shield mech against a spearman mech that hadn’t moved away in time. "Westcott forever!"
"Westcott forever!" The mech pilots of the defending mechs echoed.
None of them questioned whether it made sense to defend a facility while the rest of the planet went crazy. Their loyalty to their company compelled them to fight, if not to the bitter end, then at least they should give a good accounting.
Yet the attackers were no slouches either. "Victory to UAS!"
"Victory to UAS!"
Civilians ran towards old and neglected shelters. Troublemakers sought their chance to even the scores against their rivals. The rebels fanned the flames by destroying key infrastructure and inciting mass panic.
All the while, the auxiliary regiments that turned traitor took control over enough anti-air turrets to make every ascent into space a risky prospect. They also deployed hidden missile launchers throughout Detemen IV to augment their air defense and bring down any vessel that tried to escape the planet.
Dozens of ships and shuttles fell before everyone learned their lesson. Unless they boarded a heavily armored combat carrier, they wouldn’t dream about making another attempt.
The rebels still kept up their guard. They knew that Lord Javier was on the surface when the rebellion broke out. He might still be biding his time to get away aboard an armored or stealthed escape vessel, so they pulled out all the stops and constantly scanned the surroundings of the capital city.
High above the skies and beyond Detemen IV’s atmosphere, the second detachment of the Vandal fleet approached the moons. Two of them posed a considerable concern to Major Verle. Without securing those two locations, he wouldn’t feel reassured when he deployed his landbound mechs to the planet.
"Mr. Brandstad! Give me something!"
"We’re working on it!" Alloc frazzedly replied. Both Ves and Alloc scoured through tons of data in order to find a way to ease the next actions.
Neither Ves nor Alloc found any obvious weaknesses in the laser rifleman mechs that formed the main line of defense at the lunar fortress.
The focus lay on the Amevon Mark VII Type D, which served as House Eneqqin’s standard rearguard mech model. The House’s in-house designers formed the Type D as a simpler and more affordable variant of their much more renowned Type A design.
The Type A was an impressive laser rifleman mech design that formed the mainstay of House Eneqqin’s household troops. Therefore, a cheaper variant derived from it wouldn’t be so easy to crack. The Type D inherited most of the Type A’s strengths while hardly exposing any weaknesses.
Obviously, a lot of effort had been put into optimizing its design. Hundreds of mech designers spent many thousands of man-hours into working away its flaws. Try as he might, Ves peered at the Type D’s design from every direction but couldn’t put a dent in its seemingly perfect exterior.
"I don’t believe this design is perfect! No design is perfect!"
The only weaknesses of the Type D they came up with so far were the generic ones that all laser rifleman mechs suffered from, such as their low burst damage and their vulnerability up close.
Even a toddler could figure that out. Ves had to dig deeper and find something more pertinent in order to make the upcoming battle a little easier for the Vandals.
Fortunately, he wasn’t working alone. Alloc possessed a lot of experience in this area, and he quickly honed in on a potential weakness. "Ves! Study its heat dispersal mechanisms! I remember that the Mark VI version of the Type A relies on disposable coolants to get rid of most of its heat in an instant. If the coolant tank got burst, the mech’s internals almost always glitched out. See if this still applies for the Mark VII!"
The Amevon series had progressed by a major milestone since those weaknesses became known. Its designers must have certainly patched up the vulnerabilities, but they wouldn’t have been able to mitigate the problem completely. The Type D possessed too little structure to do so.
Now that Alloc shone a light in a potentially promising direction, Ves rapidly called up past data on the Mark VI and Mark VII versions of the Type A and Type D. Most of the intelligence had been derived through a combination of analyzing past battle footage and stealing sensitive design documents by the intelligence services of the Republic.
This caused the data to be largely incomplete. Ves had to struggle through gaping holes and unreliable guesswork, but eventually he found a chink in the armor.
"I think they changed the placement of the coolant tank to the center and inwards! However, the discharge mechanisms are largely the same! It’s harder to breach the coolant tank, but if our boys can manage it, the Type D’s will certainly be taken out of commission!"
"Good work Ves, but it’s not enough!"
They passed on the information to Major Verle anyway. This kept the mech commander off their backs for a tiny bit. The two mech designers continued to study the active cooling systems of the Type, knowing that there must be more they could find out.
"Deploying spaceborn mechs!"
A large number of spaceborn mechs launched from the hangar bays of the combat carriers and took up guard positions. For the assault of the lunar fortress, Major Verle wanted to drop close but not quite on top of the Vesian defenders.
With most of the turrets taken out by the rebels, the Vesian anti-air capabilities had become severely curtailed. While the Vandals still had to be wary of their rifleman mechs, Major Verle gambled on the possibility would be able to drop onto the surface without suffering any losses.
Ves thought that Verle had made a very bold bet.
Minutes away from starting the descent of half of their combat carriers, Ves finally achieved a breakthrough in his analysis!
"Reporting! The Amavon Mark VII Type D’s are vulnerable to explosive and kinetic damage to their lower left sides! The armor doesn’t need to be breached in order to cripple it. The Type D skimped on their structural integrity, so it won’t be able to shield its internals against the concussive shocks from explosive and kinetic attacks."
Ves sent along his analysis of the weakness. Attacking the lower left side of the Type D’s would potentially allow their assailants to take them out with up to fifty percent less effort than taking it out conventionally!
"That’s more like it!" Major Verle complimented him for once. "Switch up the first wave! I want the missileers up front and advance to medium range before unleashing their payloads! Bring the Akkara’s up front as well!"
"Sir, that would leave our carriers undefended!"
"Then hold the Hellcats and a couple of Inheritors back! They won’t be of much use in the coming attack!"
The last-minute adjustments made it clear that Major Verle was prepared to stake the lives of his men and women over the vulnerability revealed by the mech designers.
This caused Ves to gulp. It was all well and good to state his observations, but if he spoke incorrectly, a lot of lives would be lost due to his words. Sweat poured down his brow as he watched the coming action with a lot of apprehension.You can trace the roots of this content at n0v@lbin
Even before the combat carriers made landfall, the lunar fortress unleashed a deluge of missiles. Much less than what they ought to have been able to launch, but still a considerable amount.
Major Verle quickly issued orders to strike down the missile salvo. Akkara mechs anchored inside the bunkers along the exterior the of carriers started to fire their rapid-fire cannons in unison. They had been designed in part to provide a powerful form of defense against the Vesian propensity to throw out a lot of missiles. The incoming missile salvo already started to diminish.
Other mechs lent their firepower as well, though their coordination was lacking. The Vandals relied too much on random mech models stolen from the Vesians. Their weapon configurations differed very widely, making it difficult to synchronize their fire.
Nevertheless, the spaceborn Vandals acted competently and wiped out the missile salvo just as it entered medium range.
The lunar fortress failed to launch a second salvo. It appeared that the rebels hadn’t been lying when they said that they destroyed most of their stockpiles. Still, the suspicion that the Vesians might be holding back their missiles in order to trap the Vandals loomed closely.
With the lunar fortress offering no further response, the Vandal combat carriers that arrived on the surface calmly disgorged their landbound mechs. Many of these machines suffered from unsteady footing. The small moon exhibited a very weak gravity, causing most mech pilots to curse as their feet constantly bounced them above the surface.
Fortunately, they adjusted quickly. A week before they arrived at the Detemen System, the mech pilots of the Flagrant Vandals drilled extensively in every possible environment they might be deployed on. They already learned how to deal with the second moon’s gravity, but simulations were no substitute for the real thing. They wouldn’t be as good as the defending Vesians in moving around, and that was a significant disadvantage.
The only upside to the moon’s weak gravity was that the Vandal spaceborn mechs could lend a hand as well. They didn’t fare too well under standard gravity conditions, but the moon was so small and weak that their flight systems hardly needed to compensate.
The Vandal mechs formed up. Due to the wide variety of mech models, they resembled a mob of pirate mechs more than a professional military formation. The only attempt at homogenizing them was to coat their exteriors in the regimental colors of the Flagrant Vandals, burgundy and black.
Even then, many subgroups adopted their own patterns. Some mechs employed camouflage patterns, while others adorned their mechs with animal heads. More utilized geometrical patterns that looked oddly hypnotic.
In the eyes of an outsider like Ves, the Vandal mechs looked disorderly. He could tell from the orders issued by Major Verle and the movements of their mechs that they operated in a very decentralized fashion. Major Verle only issued a handful of broad orders, which his subordinate officers translated into slightly more specific orders to the different companies that took part in the assault.
The true decision makers appear to be the captains that led their companies. These companies differed widely in numbers and mech makeup. Some of them were at half-strength at twenty-two mechs, while one of them moved with seventy mechs, each of them seemingly a different model!
As much as Ves wanted to spit out and decry the travesty of it all, the Flagrant Vandals somehow found order in chaos. They made their eclectic mix of mechs work seamlessly. Upon closer inspection, Ves realized that every mech company wasn’t grouped by type or purpose and that they didn’t choose to balance out their mechs either.
The companies had been grouped according to their movement speed.
This led to a surprising level of coordinated maneuvering. The scout companies moved first and approached the lunar fortress, which the Vesians chose to perch on a low hill surrounded by flattened terrain.
A lot of signs showed that the perimeter used to be very rocky, but the defenders deliberately cleared away the rocks and flattened the overall surroundings in order to deny any approaching enemy on land the benefit of cover.
"Heat signatures detecting! Incoming laser fire!"
The mechs atop the walls already started firing potshots at the approaching scout companies from the air and on the surface of the moon. Major Verle made a quick judgement and held his scouts on a leash, not wishing to go further and risk them getting attacked by a prepared volley.
The slower companies caught up while the scouts flanked the fortress. After a few more moments of preparation, the assault began.
"Attack! Breach the fortress and finish off the defenders!"
A heavy amount of firepower poured into the walls of the fortress, diminishing it at a surprisingly low pace. The walls had been laced with an abundant amount of junk exotics as well as a few more valuable substances, which was much more than standard. The cost to erect this fortress must be at least three times as much as a regular fortification!"
"The Detemen II is a resource processing center." Alloc reminded Major Verle. "Many materials are shipped in and out of this star system. Those fortress walls are laced with Brown Laxanite, which is famed for their ability to dampen shocks. That increases the resilience of the walls by at least half!"
"Is there anything else you can tell about the walls, Mr. Brandstad?"
Alloc furrowed his brows. Ves passed him a couple of observations, but none of them were notable enough to be mentioned.
"No, sir, only to state that the walls rely on Laxanite to withstand explosive and kinetic attacks, while utilizing their enormous mass to neuter any laser fire. It’s incredibly resilient against every conventional damage type."
That left out a lot of weapons with strange effects, such as the Greater Terran United Confederation’s Destroyer Weapons. One slice of a Destroyer Sword would easily be able to part the thick walls in half.
Naturally, the Vandals didn’t carry anything like that.
"We’re going to have to do this the old-fashioned way. Inheritors! Prepare to dive in!"
Major Verle constantly showed his impatience. Ves gathered that the commander wasn’t being reckless, but the importance of staying on schedule weighed heavily on the entire mech regiment.
They only had four days to play with, and that was only an estimate of their allotted time. The Vesian reinforcements might come sooner or later, but the Vandals didn’t count on getting lucky in that regard.
While much of the lower ranks of the Vandals remained ignorant, Colonel Lowenfield and her most trusted subordinates like Major Verle planned for this operation for years. They always intended to make a far-ranging raid on a star system deep within Kingdom space.
The Detemen System had actually been selected as a potential longshot candidate due to its stability, relative wealth and lack of internal conflicts.
That last point proved to be pivotal to this attack. Many star systems with a little bit more wealth might allow the Vandals to earn a bigger harvest, but their riches attracted plenty of ambitious nobles.
Not so for this star system. Detemen II was the main seat of House Jier, and while it would be possible to dislodge them, Count Reizen established lots of ties with his neighbors, which minimized the occurrence of violent conflicts.
As for Detemen IV, no one wanted to touch Lord Javier. As the sole son of Count Loqer, any other local noble would practically be committing suicide if they touched that planet.
Count Loqer’s influence in the Imodris Duchy made him a powerful regional bully. He was the trusted hand of the Duchess and had served as her former chief of staff.
With the amount of favor Loqer earned from the Duchess of Imodris, House Eneqqin was on the rise. No one openly dared to defy them. Yet while this status might make their rivals back away, it proved to be one of the most pivotal reasons why the Vandals chose to attack the Detemen System.
House Imodris sent the majority of their legions to the frontlines. Those that remained had been tasked with guarding the Duchy’s capital and several vitally important star systems. As much as the Duchess favored Count Loqer, she would never divert her crack troops to defend a marginally significant star system.
Because behind the open threat of the Vandals, a follow-up invasion might ensue if the remaining legions moved to aid the Detemen System.
As for the barons and counts that occupied the star systems closest to the Detemen System, they would definitely move to support their beleaguered neighbors when prompted by House Imodris, but they would be sure to take the slowest route possible without being accused of leaving the Detemen System out to dry.
"No one will come and reinforce the Detemen System for at least three days. That should be enough time to complete all of our objectives, but only if nothing else goes wrong."
The Vandals made slow progress into chipping away at the fort walls. Their ability to resist both energy and physical attacks made them extremely hard to deal with. Due to the angles, the landbound mechs stood no chance in weakening the defending mechs.
The defenders did not suffer from that problem as the Vandal mechs were exposed on flat terrain. They could easily fire on every mech they wished from their comfortably elevation positions behind the walls.
The only reason why the Vesians hadn’t exacted a heavier toll was because they were pacing their face. Ballistic ammunition was in really short supply, and while they could replenish their batteries fairly quickly by recharging them from the fortifications power reactors, they could only recover so much juice at a given moment.
More than that, the Type D’s paced their fire due to their inability to shunt their heat fast enough. Every time they built up a significant amount of heat, they retreated and deployed several spikes from their hips that anchored into the walls. This allowed them to transfer their accumulating heat through the spikes and stave off their heat limits, if only temporarily.
"The Inheritors are making their move!" Alloc whispered to Ves, which caused him to divert more attention to their plummeting descent.
They dove down on a diagonal trajectory, making it rather hard for the defending Type D’s to target them. Several Inheritors got hit by the laser beams that raked their loose formation. A single laser beam wouldn’t cripple them, but their armor was so thin that they would certainly feel the hurt.
The Vesian defenders became a little smarter about their targeting and started to focus their fire on a handful of Inheritors. This caused the targeted mechs to be extremely unlucky.
While the mech pilots of the Type D’s weren’t good enough to box their targets in an undodgeable storm of lasers, they at least managed to whittle down the Inheritors at a mildly alarming rate. Those assigned to pilot the Inheritors weren’t exactly the best of what the Flagrant Vandals had to offer.
"Men, ready your knives!"
Still, the Inheritors zipped down so fast that the Type D’s constantly had to readjust their aim to cope with the changing trajectories. As the Inheritors appeared larger and larger on their targeting scopes, the Type D’s needed to swivel their aim in wider arcs in order to keep up.
"The time is upon us! Go in-and-out!"
The Inheritors engaged their flight systems in full, causing them to stop their impending crash to the ground and instead propel them forward, right into the lines of defenders. A handful of melee mechs stepped forth to shield their weaker comrades. The Inheritors that faced those melee mechs could do nothing in the short term to take these sturdy mechs down, so they preemtively circled around and flew back up.
As for the other Inheritors, they faced no obstacle except for the wall, and even that provided no succor to the Type D’s. The Inheritors smartly passed over the walls and maneuvered around to hit the Type D mechs from the sides or from the rear.
The laser rifleman mechs stood no chance. The Inheritors showed extreme excellence in peeling apart the vulnerable ranged mechs. At least a third of the Type D’s dropped their rifles and gripped their backup knives in time, but their mech frames were wholly unsuited to duel against a skirmisher.
It was a massacre.
Only ten seconds passed at most before the Inheritors finished their allotted time. Those that hadn’t finished off their targets retreated without hesitation after reaching the limit.
The results of the short but intense action quickly became clear. At the cost of half a dozen Inheritors, at least a third of the defending Type D’s had been taken out.
"We’ve got them!"
Ves couldn’t help but feel relieved that his educated guess panned out. Analyzing the Amavon Mark VII Type D on the fly was very difficult because Ves could only base his conclusions from past versions of the mech model and its visible performance.
It was as if he cracked the code of a simple keypad by observing it from a distance and looking at the marks left behind.
After the initial pass, the Inheritors turned around and dove again. Combined with the push of the Vandal landbound mechs, the defenders faced a hellish dilemma. They needed to pour their firepower to the encroaching ground pounders. Once the Vandal melee mechs reached the walls, it was over. Yet if they neglecting the Inheritors buzzing above, they’d be dead as well.
Ves didn’t know if their commander was stupid or desperate, but around half of the rifleman mechs focused on each of the Vandal threats.
This happened to be one of the better outcomes for the Flagrant Vandals. By splitting up the attention of their enemy, they insured that they spread their fire. Though the individual mechs still focused their fire on a couple of hand-selected targets, the Vandals already started to adjust.
Any mech that got targeted would instantly retreat or find cover from their comrades. They did everything possible to spoil the aim of their enemies, and if they couldn’t hold on, their pilots would eject regardless of the waste.
This preserved the lives of the mech pilots but led to a slight increase in wrecked mechs. Still, as long as the Vandals won the field, they would easily be able to salvage their fallen mechs and bring them back online.
Of course, the true prize in this assault would be to salvage the enemy mechs. Though they weren’t all that valuable, the Flagrant Vandals brought out a lot of transports, and their logistics ships held an abundant amount of cargo holds as well.
Unless the Vandals encountered a large stash of exotics, recovering mechs was always the most cost-efficient option. They took up less space and weighed a little less than containers worth the same amount.
Nevertheless, this attack would generally be considered a loss. A lot of damage had been sustained that needed to be repaired later on. This drained a lot of money, but also wasted a lot of time that could have been put to more productive uses. Overall, Ves estimated the Vandals lost more than they would be able to salvage from the battlefield.
The pressure on the Flagrant Vandals therefore continued to pile up. If they weren’t able to raid the the wealth-laden surface of Detemen IV very soon, the mech regiment would certainly succumb under all of the debt it accrued.
"Without the support of the Mech Corps, the Vandals judge every action according to how much money they would gain or lose."
It was an awful way to run a mech regiment because it led to overly mercenary decision making. What was best for the Flagrant Vandals might not be best for the Mech Corps and the Bright Republic. Ves had seen plenty of the Vandals to know that they wouldn’t lose much sleep if they worked against the Republic’s interests.
The key figure here was Colonel Lowenfield. From what he heard, Lowenfield pulled the Vandals from the depths of despair by using her extensive administrative acumen to clean up their finances. Still, she could do only so much, hence the need for the attack on a fat sheep like the Detemen System.
"The Vesian defenders are pulling back!"
Emboldened by the sudden decrease in enemy fire aimed in their direction, the Inheritors boldly dove at the rifleman mechs over and over again. They leveraged their speed to the highest order and completely threw the defenders in disarray with their maniacal upfront passes.
Under these circumstances, the casualties of the defenders rapidly piled up while the Inheritors lost less and less mechs with each pass. Eventually, the Vesian mechs broke and abandoned the outer wall. They contracted their lines and congregated at a smaller but more defensible inner wall.
The Inheritors pulled back into the sky while the landbound mechs slowly climbed over the outer walls and made their way to the inner walls.
At this point, Ves pretty much considered the battle to be over. The ballistic rifleman mechs already expended most of their ammunition by now, and the laser rifleman mechs lost too many of their number to pose a serious threat to the Vandals.
Everyone in the command center loosened their shoulders. Even Major Verle started to sit back in his chair. As long as the Vesians holed up in the inner sanctum of the lunar fortress didn’t spring them a surprise, the moon was as good as conquered.
"How is the assault on the research base progressing?" Major Verle turned to another officer who had been tasked with taking care of the third moon.
"Sir, we have been forced to halt our mech deployment when we detected signs of heightened mech activity."
Verle frowned. "What have you detected?"
"Resonance."
Everyone briefly paused when they heard that word. Resonance could be detected at a fair distance under certain circumstances. Anytime a sensor detected resonance, a lot of other sensors would point their arrays in the direction in question.
"Is it confirmed?"
"It’s confirmed, sir. The Vesian researchers aren’t being circumspect about it. They’re actively flaunting it as if to warn us back. In response, I aborted the drop lest we risk our combat carriers."
"You made the right decision."
The Vandals only allocated two companies to assault the research base, which should have been enough to overrun most bases of that size. As their ships orbited closer and closer to the moon, their scanners detected even less active mechs than projected. It should have been a cakewalk to take over the research base, but the presence of a resonating mech threw all of their projections out the window.
A heavy weight descended on the command center.
"Strength?"
"Thirteen laveres."
Some of the specialists let out a sigh. The resonance wasn’t as strong as everyone feared. Ves incidentally learned a lot about resonance through the System, so he knew the significance of detecting a strength of 13 laveres.
One of the early pioneers of mech design came up with a standardized scale of measurement to determine the strength of resonance between an elite mech pilot and a mech that was geared for resonance. Master Lavere named his own scale after himself, and for some reason the entire mech industry accepted it over other proposed measurement units.
In a nutshell, a lavere measured the overall amplifying strength of resonance at a scale of 1 to 10,000.
An expert pilot that barely ascended into the ranks of the elites would measure just slightly above 1.
A newly ascended ace pilot possessed could exert at least 67 laveres of resonance.
God pilots started out with a whopping amount of 1545, and was theoretically able to flex their ability to resonate with mechs until they reached the arbitrary number 10,000.
What happened after that, nobody knew, because no god pilot ever lived to grow to such a monstrous level.
The exact mathematics behind the lavere scale was very complicated. The scale wasn’t linear, so an expert mech that measured 20 laveres wasn’t stronger than another expert mech that reached a level of resonance of only 10 laveres.
Nevertheless, the suspected expert mech within the research base could still inflict a massive amount of damage to the invading Vandal force with only 13 laveres of strength. Naturally, this depended heavily on the type and weight class of the expert’s mech, but regardless of its form, no expert should be underestimated.
After a moment of consideration, Major Verle came to a momentous decision. "Put Venerable Rix O’Callahan on standby."
"Acknowledged, sir."
A moment passed before a communication channel forcibly opened up to the command center.
"Verle!" An irascible voice exploded. "I’m not going out!"
Everyone turned a little glum. Ves looked around a bit cluelessly until he started to get it. "This old man’s voice..."
Was this Venerable O’Callahan?"
"Venerable, please. We have encountered signs of another expert, so we have no choice but to call for your services."
"Bah! I heard what’s going on! A brat that can’t resonate beyond thirteen laveres is not worth my time! Go pile up on him with a couple of hundred mechs and leave me alone!"
Major Verle looked like he wanted to explode, but he successfully kept himself from lashing out. He swiped his hand at an angle, causing a minor interference field to deploy that blocked their conversation. Ves wouldn’t be able to eavesdrop any further.
"Is Venerable O’Callahan our expert pilot, sir?"
"For better or worse." Alloc sighed next to Ves. "The man’s on the wane. He used to be a hotshot expert in the wars before, but age eventually takes its toll. He lashed out at the Republic for refusing to provide him with age-prolonging treatments. Ever since then, he assumed position as one of our resident expert pilots."
"Why isn’t the Venerable trying his luck with the Coalition if he’s so desperate to prolong his life?"
Alloc shook his head in pity. "Oh, he tried. He only spent two years bouncing from partner to partner until they all got fed up with him and chucked him back to our embrace."
Practically everyone worshipped expert pilots, so Ves found it strange that the Vandals regarded him with such indifference. It was yet another quirk to add to the list of oddities.
A few minutes passed by as Major Verle negotiated with Venerable O’Callahan. Ves and Alloc awkwardly sat at their seats. They didn’t have much to do since the battle at the second moon was pretty much over while the battle at the third moon hadn’t started yet.
The research base kept everything under wraps besides revealing the fact that they possessed an expert mech. Ves didn’t know why they revealed one of their trump cards right off the bat. Shouldn’t they have kept it hidden until the Vandals wandered into their trap? They could have killed a lot of Vandals with such a trick.
When Ves posed the question to Alloc, the Journeyman smiled ruefully at him. "Don’t you see that we have military superiority? If the research base is staffed by loyal fanatics, sure they would want to wipe out as much of our numbers as possible. That they chose to forgo that choice shows that they are cowards who value their lives over any possible damage they can inflict on us. Revealing their expert mech up front is supposed to serve as a deterrent."
"Aren’t the Vesians supposed to be motivated to die for the cause? Why are they acting so timidly?"
"You mistake their mech pilots for the rest of their society. Every mech pilot in the Mech Legion is willing to go to any extremes to earn a lot of merits in battle because if there is one thing the Vesia Kingdom is good at, it’s with rewarding the families of their fallen. They know that they can die in peace, knowing that their spouses will be taken care of and their children would be able to enter exclusive academies. In some extraordinary cases, their children may even be elevated to knight or baron to reward instances of exceptional valor."
In other words, it wasn’t as if the Vesian mech pilots fought for an abstract cause. They fought for the same goals as any human, to better their lives and the lives of their families.
This motivating force was largely lost when it came to rearguard units and those that worked in a non-military capacity. Whoever called the shots at the research base did not wish to die in vain.
The interference field suddenly dropped. Major Verle glowered and gnashed his teeth as the comm channel closed by itself. "Recall orders to ready Venerable O’Callahan. The honorable expert pilot is... not feeling well enough to sortie."
Ves sat stunned as the rest of the Vandals accepted that sorry excuse. Although expert pilots enjoyed an elevated status in the Mech Corps, they had not reached the point where they could outright refuse a direct order from a superior.
This was the first time he had witnessed such an event.
"Halt the planned attacks on the research base. We’re moving on to the next phase."
Major Verle unwillingly retreated from the third moon. The ships under his command consolidated in orbit over the second moon and started to retrieve the mechs and loot from the fallen lunar fortress.
The battle there ended quickly once the Vandals overcame the inner walls. Not wishing to fight to the death, the defending Vesians surrendered without exception. For their part, the Vandals accepted their surrender and took the mech pilots into custody.
They restrained the norms that acted as support personnel in place because they held no value. Taking them along burdened the Vandals more than the Vesians, and they didn’t feel like killing them after they magnanimously surrendered.
Ves got the sense that the Vandals weren’t above killing their prisoners, but only if the Vesians pissed them off in some way. In that regard, the Vesians manning the lunar fortress did their duty but nothing more.
The Vandals took slightly more than two hours to strip down the lunar fortress. They retrieved most of what they could easily salvage, but hadn’t managed to clean the fortress out entirely due to lack of time and lifting power.
They did leave a parting gift as the last mechs boarded the combat carriers and lifted off from the surface. Several portions of the fortress blew up, causing almost every section to collapse except for the areas which held the prisoners. It would take a significant amount of effort to bring the fortress back to strength after all of the destruction.
With the moons taken out of consideration, if only nominally, Major Verle turned his attention to the planet that held most of the star system’s riches. Detemen IV, the fourth planet from the binary suns.
At the major’s orders, the combat carriers formed up and moved into a lower orbit over the bountiful temperate planet. Much of its cities burned, but from high up the planet still resembled a jewel.
The attacks on the moons only served as their appetizers. Making landfall on Detemen IV and completing their subsequent objectives would be the main course. They gathered as much information as they could about Detemen IV and its local forces, but the rebels who provided most of their intelligence had been proven wrong several times before.
It was too easy to hide any number of assets on a planet. Even as the Vandal combat carriers turned their sensors towards the planet and attempted to scan the underground layers, they failed to turn up any results.
The Vesians either hid their assets well, or they really hadn’t stationed any hidden forces on the planet.
"Don’t get complacent, Ves." Alloc whispered to him. "What comes up next will be our real test. Urban combat is always messy. Depending on how much the locals can organize themselves, we can have a real fight on our hands. They still collectively outnumber us."
As much as that fact concerned Ves, the chances that they would unite in a common defense was low. That would mean submitting themselves to a single leader. Short of Lord Javier, no one possessed enough clout to unite the local forces.
"I’ve never been through a raid from the perspective of the raiders."
"This is more than a simple raid, Ves. We’ve established many objectives, but our main goals are to rob enough to make our losses worth it and to root out Lord Javier from whatever hole he’s crawled into. That’s going to be difficult to complete in a very short timespan."
Ves thought that they had made a lot of haste, but evidently Alloc thought otherwise. With time pressing on their backs, they couldn’t afford to delay their steps. The Vandals readied themselves to be deployed. The combat carriers split in two. Those that carried spaceborn mechs would remain in orbit while those that carried landbound mechs descended to the surface.
A tense moment ensued as some of the combat carriers made the risky action of descending into hostile territory. Though the rioting and the anarchy caused the planet to be thrown into confusion, that didn’t mean that every local lost their minds. A counterattack could come at any moment.
While the combat carriers made the drop, Ves and Alloc already started analyzing the data that the rebels constantly poured in. They captured a lot of footage of mechs stomping around. Many influences held back some strength, and if not for all the strife, they never would have pulled out their reserve forces.
It was the job of the mech designers to analyze each model spotted in the wild and give out a cursory evaluation of their strength. With hundreds of different mech models spotted on the surface, the pair would have succumbed from all of the work, but luckily they didn’t work alone. Other mech designers assigned to other ships did their part as well, thereby massively speeding up the identification and classification process.
Ves had never analyzed so many different mech models in such a short amount of time. The effort strained him somewhat and he made a lot of mistakes. Yet each time he fell, he picked himself up again and learned how to do better. He became increasingly proficient in spotting the strengths and weaknesses of mechs merely from spotty footage.
Besides their propensity for missiles, the Vesians on Detemen IV also leaned towards bestial mechs. These animal-shaped mechs took the place of melee mechs mostly as they all focused on closing in the distance with their four limbs and savage their opponents with claws and perhaps teeth.
"House Eneqqin is very partial to bestial mechs." Alloc quickly explained. "They’re famous for fielding the Imodris Duchy’s premiere bestial mech regiments. Most of them are sent to the frontlines, though, so we won’t meet those elites on the field today."
So that explained it. House Eneqqin’s rich tradition in working with bestial mechs helped compensate for the increased difficulty in mastering those types of mechs. Human mech pilots adjusted best when they piloted humanoid mech models.
There had always been sceptics who claimed that the human form was not always the most conductive form for combat. They derisively dismissed the bipedal human form and their dependance on tools as inefficiencies. Mech designers who adhered to this school of thought instead sought to develop alternatives based on animals and aliens.
The so-called bestial supremacy movement was a powerful strain within the galactic mech industry, but their grip in the Komodo Star Sector was fairly weak. The main advantages of bestial mechs was that they provided a lot of variety. The downsides to using them was it took a substantial amount of effort to train them with different animal forms.
That made animal-shaped mechs rather rare in the resource-starved galactic rim.
Pretty much every mech designers in the galactic rim fell into the humanoid supremacy movement, including Ves.
In practice, no one in the Bright Republic paid attention to these doctrinal and ideological disputes. Perhaps closer to the center of the galaxy, mech designers from different camps would confront each other and even initiated design duels to prove their point, but Ves found all of it rather silly.
"Those bestial mechs are geared for standing battles. They’re not the hit-and-run types."
Ves studied the models seen in the wild and quietly agreed. These tiger and wolf-shaped mechs possessed a lot of bulk, putting them well in the upper range of the medium weight class. This gifted them with a hefty charge and powerful attacks but slow attacks up close, but it didn’t do their speed and agility any good.
Nonetheless, due to their form, they were just a notch faster and more agile than humanoid mechs that weighed the same. Their four limbs provided them with a lot more stability as they didn’t have to worry about tipping over as much.
The downside of course was that they couldn’t make use of external equipment such as swords and rifles. They went into battle with the weapons already fixed into their frames.
Fighting them would be a nightmare on land, but aerial mechs should make quick work of them. Unfortunately, the Vandals weren’t very strong in the air. They focused primary on spaceborn mechs and diverted some of their efforts on building up a force of landbound mechs by necessity.
Perhaps some spaceborn mechs would accompany the landbound mechs on the ground, but Ves couldn’t see a fragile machine like the Inheritor ever doing so. He was familiar enough with its design to realize that the Inheritors would get massively slowed down when put under the influence of gravity.
As Ves continued to analyze mechs, a sudden change occurred just as the combat carriers heading to the surface touched land. A large number of heat signatures and alarms blared over the consoles of the specialists.
"Detecting active scanning from seventeen different locations from the surface! Our ships are being painted, sir!"
"What?! Plot those locations on the map right now!"
The central projector which displayed Detemen IV lit up with seventeen different points strewn about in random locations in the wilderness.
"Sir, detecting mass missile launches from eight other locations on Detemen IV and the second moon!"
More points lit up. This time, several trails flew up from these locations. Both in front and in their rear, the Vandal fleet faced an incoming surge of Vesian missiles.
No doubt whoever was in charge had been holding them back until the Vandals landed half their combat carriers. The Akkara mechs that served as their point defense would have been a significant help in shooting down the missiles. Now it was too late to recall the landed ships. The missiles traveled too fast for them to catch up.
Though Major Verle and the fleet in orbit had plenty of time to meet the incoming missiles, that hardly served as a consolation to them due to the sheer size of the missile salvo.
"What is the current count?"
"Reporting, an estimated number of forty-three thousand missiles have launched from Detemen IV. Fifteen-thousand missiles coming inbound from the second moon."
"Sensors have detected a second salvo!"
The mood in the command center plummeted at this point. Dealing with almost sixty thousand missiles was already a challenge. Dealing with twice as much would strain their defenses until they broke.
The news was already bad enough, but what came next was worse.
"A third salvo of missiles have launched from Detemen IV!"
"What about the launch sites on the second?"
"No activity detected! By all accounts, the crew of those sites have evacuated."
The third salvo looked a little more ragged. Evidently, the Vesians had thrown whatever they had left at the Vandal fleet up in orbit.
A total of 150,000 missiles headed in their direction. To a mech regiment that favored melee mechs over ranged mechs, this was an absolute disaster.
"Tell me of their makeup, now!" Major Verle bellowed.
Alloc and Ves already started to work on that as soon as the Vandals detected the missile launches. Eventually, they both came to the conclusion that only two types of missile had been launched.
"The missiles comprise of two different types." Alloc answered. "The missiles launched from the surface all consists of the Heavensfall HVA-535, a standard Vesian surface-to-space shipkiller missile type. They’re characterized by their extremely powerful propulsion that lets them escape the gravity well of a terrestrial planet and build up a significant amount of velocity. Their payloads are largely explosive or kinetic depending on the variant, which we haven’t been able to determine as of yet, sir."
"Then get on that as soon as possible! What of the other type?"
Since Ves analyzed those missiles, it was his turn to answer the major. "The hidden lunar sites have launched two salvos of XX-REX Mark 54-H missiles. The XX-REX type missiles are characterised by their high explosive payloads, and the H variant of the Mark 54’s denote the heaviest version of this type of missiles, so they pack an even greater punch."
They both relayed the exact numbers to Major Verle’s terminal, who studied the data with increasing alarm.
The waves of missiles from the surface of Detemen IV needed to fight against gravity to reach the orbiting Vandal ships, so they generally didn’t have too much left by the time they reached their targets. The sheer amount of missiles made up for their relative weakness in this area.
As for the XX-REX missiles launched from the second moon, they came in much fewer numbers, but a combat carrier that got hit in the right sections would certainly crack apart despite their superior armor coverage. The amount of damage they could deal already approached the level of torpedoes.
In short, they were screwed from both the front and the rear.
Both the Heavensfall and the XX-REX missiles represent specific types of military ordnance. Compared to the missiles used by mercs and gangs, the missiles used by the Mech legion possessed a lot of advantages.
They hit harder, their ECM wouldn’t be as easy to fool and they accelerated significantly faster as well. Superior development only played a minor role in their performance. The true reason why the Flagrant Vandals feared these missiles was because they incorporated various amounts of exotics.
The use of expensive materials lay at the root of their performance. The Bright Republic generally shied away from such practices, as they considered lacing their missiles with junk exotics or low-grade exotics to be an absolute waste.
A missile launched from a tube would be a missile that could never be recovered. Once it detonated or got intercepted, the wreckage would be strewn over a huge area, and in certain cases be blown by the wind on a planet or carried along their initial impulse in space.
It was safe to say that in cases like that, the expensive exotics would never be recovered.
Yet the Vesians didn’t see it that way. Certainly, their active use of missiles cost a pretty penny, but they treated it as an investment. As long as they inflicted more damage on the enemy than what the missiles cost, then they came out ahead on a net basis.
That put the 150,000 missiles heading in their direction in a very ominous light. The resources put in their manufacture could have been used to acquire another combat carrier or two. If the Mech Corps faced the same equation, then they would have certainly gone for extra ships. Not so for the Vesians, who only thought in terms of how much damage they could inflict.
"Estimated casualties?" Major Verle asked a specialist in charge of simulations.
"A high possibility of three to five combat carriers sustaining heavy damage. One or two may even break apart."
The shipkiller missiles only targeted their ships. The Vesians might wish to target their transports and logistics ships as well because the Flagrant Vandals depended on them to make their way back home.
In any case, the incoming missiles needed to be dealt with. Major Verle stood up. "We’ve trained for this! Engage anti-missile countermeasures!"
With the Vesian propensity for launching mass missile swarms, the Mech Corps drilled relentlessly on how to take them out. Major Verle only needed to mention a few plans and issue a couple of instructions to make his ships and mechs adopt a defensive posture optimized against missiles.
Naturally, the Vesians didn’t make it easy on their enemies to take their missiles out one by one. For one, they staggered their missiles in such a way that all 150,000 of them arrived near-simultaneously at their targets.
The first salvo traveled a little slower and adopted slightly arched trajectories, while the missiles behind them took a more direct approach and burned a little faster. Over time, the distances would diminish until they formed a combined volley of apocalyptic proportions.
The Flagrant Vandals much preferred the missiles to pour in to them one by one. This way, they could focus their full defensive envelope on a couple of missiles at once and take them out before the next one arrived. Sadly, no one with a brain would program their missiles to trickle in this way unless it served a special purpose.
The key to taking out so many missiles coming at them at once was to take potshots of them at extreme range.
"Launch counter-missiles!"
A handful of missileers among the Vandals launched their own missiles. The salvo released by them only numbered just above ten-thousand, an absolutely pathetic amount compared to what the Vesians threw at them. Hopefully, at least half of them would score a hit at the incoming Vesian missiles.
"Lasers, fire at will!"
Every laser-wielding mech in the mech regiment aimed their guns and fired far off into the distance. At this point, not a single mech pilot would be able to spot the missiles with the naked eye. They entrusted the aiming of their weapons entirely to their targeting systems, which all networked back to the powerful processors aboard the combat carriers.
One of the biggest advantages of laser beams over kinetic weapons was that they traveled at the speed of light and that their range was potentially enormous in the emptiness of space.
In practice, space wasn’t completely empty, and the laser beams also tended to become defocused across huge distances. In addition, although the lasers traveled really fast, the missiles didn’t travel in a straight line either.
The Vesian missiles poured a lot of research into improving their capability to dodge extreme-range laser fire. Small boosters embedded along their structure pushed the missiles left and right, up and down and even back and forth.
Extremely sophisticated algorithms governed this behavior, and unless the Mech Corps cracked the code, the Vandals wouldn’t be able to predict their dodging patterns.
Both the Heavensfall and the XX-REX missiles happened to be the one of the newer types of missiles introduced by the Mech Legion in the last couple of years. That meant that the Vandals practically faced them for the first time.
Hundreds of mechs kept firing their lasers off in the distance. They focused on the low-volume XX-REX missiles launched from the second moon because they were bigger and heavier than the Heavensfall missiles. This made them a bit more resilient, but it also made them a lot easier to hit.
Dozens of missiles got shot down as the mechs scored occasional lucky hits. The hit rate slowly increased as the missiles neared the Vandal ships, but it all went far too slow for their tastes. The extreme range along with the devilishly clever dodging patterns made each attempt to take them down a complete gamble.
In situations like this, neither of the mech designers played much of a role. Major Verle turned to others who studied Vesian missiles as their life’s work. What Ves and Alloc knew about missiles wasn’t very much, though Alloc at least tried to be helpful by trying to hack them in some way.
Good luck with that. The Vesians obsessed about having their missiles turn against them, so they employed many convoluted methods in order to prevent such an occurrence. In general, the Mech Corps only managed to crack lastgen missile models. Anything newer than that was pretty much a black box in their regard.
Many minutes passed by as the lasers took their toll on the missile salvos. Mechs that wielded projectile-based weapons stood by and waited for the missiles to come close before unleashing their own storm of fire.
Since their projectiles traveled much slower than the speed of light, it didn’t make sense to fire them right now. The missiles saw the incoming projectiles coming and would have ages of time to adjust their trajectory and move out of the way.
Thousands more missiles died. Many expensive XX-REXX missiles blew apart as they got struck. Their payloads affected nothing but empty space. Yet the Vesians wouldn’t consider their interception to be a waste. As long as they preoccupied the Vandals and prevented other missiles from being taken out, the XX-REXX missiles still served their purpose.
After a long while, the missiles finally entered the longest effective range of the Vandal projectile mechs. A huge volume of fire erupted from the mechs that had held their fear and indignation back. Now, they could finally unleash their pent-up frustration at the majestic cloud of missiles.
Thousands more missiles died each second. Ballistic weapons held a huge advantage in that they didn’t generate as much heat. As long as their ammo lasted, the mechs could fire their rifles and cannons as much as they wished.
The Akkara heavy cannoneers pretty much stole the show at this point. Though they had already started firing their laser cannons at the start, once they unleashed their explosive shells, it was as if hell descended on the missiles.
Of course, the Vesians didn’t pack the missiles close enough for multiple of them to be taken out by a single explosion. Still, the wide-area detonations made it easy to guarantee a kill.
The missile waves halved in numbers, with most of the XX-REX missiles taken out at this point. Yet that still left an abundance of Heavensfall missiles with very little time left to take them out as well.
Laser-wielding mechs kept firing their weapons regardless of the risks. Their mechs and weapons overheated in rapid tempo. Some mechs employed emergency coolant and other desperate measures to stave off a shutdown. They would rather fry their mechs than let a combat carrier go down.
In the meantime, every serviceman aboard the combat carriers buttoned down their gear and prepared for possible impact. In the Stubby Growler’s command center, chairs shook as strange components ejected from underneath and flew to encompass everyone’s bodies.
Everyone wore military-grade hazard suits now. They were rated to survive explosions, extreme temperature fluctuations and flying shrapnel, though only up to a certain point. They couldn’t match full-blown exo-skeleton suits in toughness, but they made up for it in flexibility and several systems that enhanced their survival, such as water and oxygen recycling systems.
"I’ve heard stories about what the Vesians are willing to throw at us when it comes down to it." Alloc said in a prayer-like tone. Underneath his hazard suit, his eyes narrowed into slits. "It scares me, but also excites me in a way."
"I feel the same way, sir." Ves quietly said.
The diminishing missile salvos still contained many thousands of missiles. It was easy to mistake the incoming wave as a natural disaster to which no single person could resist.
Mechs shorted out as their most fragile components melted down. Weapons blew apart as the heat and stress put on them pushed them past their limits. The combat carriers huddled somewhat together and protected the vital logistical ships in the center of their formation.
The non-combat resource processing and fabrication ships possessed virtually no armor that could withstand the Heavensfall missiles. They had to be protected at all cost because the Vandals depended on the supplies they produced to operate so far behind enemy lines.
"Deploy final countermeasures!"
Chaff, sensor-blocking particles and more ejected from the combat carriers at the last instant. The ships ejected them at the last seconds in order to give the missiles as little time to adjust.
At the very end of their journey, the final Heavensfall missiles only numbered in the low thousands. Many of them got fooled by the emergency countermeasures deployed at the last moments. More of them got shot down by the Akkara heavy cannoneers that occupied the bunkers embedded into the ships.
Yet that still left less than a hundred surviving missiles. Out of the 150,000 that the Vesians started with, the tiny sum sounded pathetic.
It was not.
For some reason, the missiles all received an update on their targeting priorities in their final seconds of life. They clustered closer to each other as they converged on a handful of combat carriers.
"They’re targeting our command ships!"
"The Stubby Growler is being pinged by twenty-seven missiles!"
"BRACE FOR IMPACT!"
Ves could barely hold on to his seat as it expanded and enveloped him in a huge crash ball. Everyone aboard the Stubby Growler became enveloped in these crash balls as well.
BOOOM!
BOOOM!
BOOOM!
They certainly needed the extra protection as the Stubby Growler shook and shuddered violently over a span of a couple of seconds. A combination of kinetic and explosive missiles overwhelmed her armor and wreaked havoc inside. Entire sections of the combat carrier lurched away from her hull and flung off into space!
Many compartments became exposed to space, spilling their contents out or exposing the interior with destructive blasts.
Sometimes, the crash balls endured the impact and heat, and other times they cracked open. Even if they seemed intact, some of their occupants broke every bone in their bodies and died on impact.
From the lowest spacers to the highest officers, no one could escape the fury of the Vesian missiles!
Against the fury of so many missiles bearing down on her, the Stubby Growler simply ceased to exist. Fragments of the former ship slung in every direction, and the final missile blast even cracked open the command center’s containment shell, flinging the crash balls loose and out into space.
Some of the white balls hit other debris. They either bounced in another direction or cracked apart, which spilled its occupants. Those that strayed too close from residual blasts, extreme radioactive materials and flinging shrapnel could count their prayers.
One crash ball happened to escape largely unscathed. Ves curled himself up in a fetal position inside his ball and kept his eyes on the HUD projected by his helmet.
He didn’t have the time to feel sorry about the Stubby Growler and the handful of other combat carriers that got hit. The final explosions launched his crash ball with a hefty push. It flew away away far too fast for anyone to retrieve it amid the chaotic aftermath of the missile impacts!
The takedown of the carriers which held the established leaders of the Vandal detachment threw the survivors into temporary confusion. Protocols quickly came into being and the surviving mech officer with the highest seniority quickly asserted his authority.
"Damage control teams, assist the damaged carriers! Rescue teams, go out and recover our men! Mechs, replenish ammunition and cool down, we need you up and running in case the Vesians send a follow-up attack!"
A second response such as launching mechs or another wave of missiles was unlikely. The Vesians likely blew their entire reserves at that single instant in order to maximize their kill potential. So far, despite the costs, they definitely scored ahead of the Flagrant Vandals.
"How much losses have we sustained so far?"
"Reporting, two combat carriers lost, including Major Verle’s Stubby Growler. Three more carriers sustained heavy damage. Eleven only suffered negligible damage. Casualties are estimated to be around seven-thousand Vandals, spread disproportionately among the lost and heavily damaged carriers."
"Our logistical ships?"
"No damage reported other than scratches from incidental impacts against floating debris. They’re safe and sound."
A small load lifted off their chests. Losing those combat carriers hurt a lot and set the Vandals back enormously, but with the logistical ships intact they could still carry the survivors home.
The newly-elevated commanding officer stared out at the projection that showed the chaotic Vandal ships converging back together. "The Vesians had their fun. Now it’s our turn to dish back the hurt."
All of this happened far away from Ves. As rescue mechs and shuttles flew out to help those nearest to their positions, the crash balls and loose-flying hazard suits kept spreading out in every direction with rapid speed.
Each and every one of them suffered a violent push that flung them far too much for the rescue teams to reach them quickly. They might have been able to make it to them if they flew towards them at their best speed, but the mechs and shuttles priorities recovering the nearest survivors.
For most, who got rescued first didn’t matter too much. However, a small portion of hazard suits and crash balls had been thrown in the direction of Detemen IV. The planet exerted a light but ever-present gravity that still drew on the approaching objects.
Some would sheer past and bend their trajectories. Others would slingshot away at a sharper angle like how a stone attached to a string could be launched away by employing Detemen IV’s gravity as centrifugal force.
As for a small portion of unlucky survivors, they traveled almost straight towards Detemen IV at such an angle that it would be impossible for them to skate past.
Basically, they were on course for planetary entry, wrapped in shells that might or might not survive the incredible amounts of heat generated from the friction of their breach into the atmosphere.
Inside one particular crash ball, Ves tried to stretch his body but couldn’t do anything due to the strong padding that surrounded his hazard suit. With hardly any room to move, Ves focused his full attention to the head-up display projected by his helmet. It interfaced with the electronics in the crash ball, allowing him a glimpse of what happened outside.
Its basic systems managed to determine that there was a really big planet in its path. It even managed to call up a pre-installed map of the planet, and trace out the crash ball’s approximate trajectory.
If nothing changed, the ball would likely crash in the middle of an ocean.
"That’s not good. I’ll either be left alone for weeks or be taken prisoner by the Vesians."
With the Vandals unlikely to rescue him before his crash ball started its descent, Ves intended to rely on his own. He couldn’t do anything in the middle of the ocean.
He needed to change course.
"Crash ball! Set destination to Neron City!"
[ADJUSTING COURSE.]
Tiny boosters affixed to the exterior of the crash ball spurted out tiny jets. This caused it to spin and alter its trajectory. Ves saw that it adopted a shallower angle in order to arc its ultimate end point away from the ocean and closer to the capital city of Detemen IV.
[COURSE CHANGE COMPLETED. RESERVE FUEL: 27 PERCENT REMAINING.]
The crash seat even allowed Ves to finetune his landing point, though the crash ball didn’t make any guarantees. Ves only took a moment to select a mech workshop district in the outskirts of Neron City.
As a mech designer, Ves fared best when surrounded by mechs or other machines. Though it was extremely risky to mix with the local Vesians in one of the most densely-populated cities of Detemen IV, it beat landing in complete wilderness.
"Without anyone watching my back, I only have my skills and my Amastendira to rely on."
While he could have gone for the much more massive manufacturing complexes located nearby, Ves thought it would be too risky to sneak inside those places. From what Ves had gathered during his stint at the Stubby Growler’s command center, most of those complexes still enjoyed protection from their company forces.
And since these prosperous manufacturing complexes attracted a lot of attention, any place that fell would be overrun with rioters and robbers. That was not the kind of people that Ves wanted to mix with. He merely wanted to scrounge some machines together in order to protect himself long enough for the Flagrant Vandals forces on the ground could pick him up.
The crash ball started to encounter an increasing amount of air. As a terraformed planet, Detemen IV contained nearly the exact same atmosphere as Old Earth. Therefore, the crash began to be slowed down by drag but also started heating up because of that.
The heat began to scorch the white surface of the ball, but the emergency device had been built to withstand just these kind of situations. Almost every crash ball flung to the planet endured the heat generated by friction.
Some of the poor sods in the hazard suits had it worse. As much as the hazard suits had been designed to endure all manner of damage, in the end they weren’t as robust as full exo-skeleton suits.
The main issue with the suits was that it couldn’t deal with the heat. Everyone that fell towards the planet without a crash ball started heating up inside their suits. Some of the older units based on outdated hazard suit designs even failed as certain fragile components suddenly broke under all of the stress.
Dozens of people died this way, burnt to a crisp from inside-out.
Ves had no time to mourn for the fallen. His crash ball shook and shuddered so violently that he could hardly read his helmet’s HUD. The figures and numbers kept shaking all over in front of his eyes.
"Damnit! The Vandals cheaped out on the hazard suits!"
At least they had the decency to employ decent crash balls. None of the balls so far had failed under the stress, though the handful of units that got damaged by flying debris started to shake a little harder.
Nevertheless, Ves started to feel mildly uncomfortable as some of the heat outside started to bleed into the interior. Pressed on all sides by cushioning materials and enclosed in a hazard suit that couldn’t move, Ves started to feel very claustrophobic. The shaking and the knowledge that the descent could go wrong at any moment also failed to reassure his concerns.
"Note to self: invest in proper emergency equipment!"
The pressure also started to bore into his body, but at least Ves had it better than most. The g-force did almost nothing to his strengthened body, and the miniature inertial compensators bled off some of it when it began to exceed a certain amount.
Still, everything depended on the continued operation of a handful of critical systems. It was far too fragile to his tastes.
Ves felt like he returned right back to the Glowing Planet or Groening IV. Just like before, Ves fell into a circumstance where everything went out of control and where his actions couldn’t change the outcome at all. He hated feeling helpless like a newborn lamb.
"This is far too crazy!"
Mech designers shouldn’t even be exposed to direct combat. Ves thought he had escaped such a fate by digging himself out of the pit filled with low-ranked mech designers, but of all the mech regiments he could end up with, he got assigned to one of the few that didn’t maintain a permanent base.
Ves always thought the Vandals held ulterior motives in keeping all of their assets mobile. Maintaining a safe and secure base on a planet far away from the frontlines might offer safe harbor to the Vandals, but it also tied them down.
By now, his crash ball had gone through the worst part of the descent. The shaking subsided and the speed of the ball’s descent had slowed down to a more controllable and manageable state.
This finally reassured him a little. "At least not everything has gone wrong."
One downside of entering atmosphere was that the crash ball lost contact with its fellow. From what he gathered until the connections broke, most of the crash balls had the same idea as he did and tried to converge around Neron City or one of the other major cities within their fuel allowance.
Last he counted, around fifty or so or so crash balls specifically directed their course towards the capital city, but they all chose different districts to land on. Some even wanted to go fall directly towards the landing site of Vandal combat carriers that carried landbound mechs to the ground.
Such an action was exceedingly risky because the Vesians on the ground weren’t vegetables.
Neron City started coming into view.
Several areas in and around Neron City started to be lit up as hidden turrets emerged from their underground enclosures and targeted the descending crash balls. Most of the anti-air turrets clustered around the palace and other important government buildings situated downtown. The manufacturing complexes also contributed some of their anti-air turrets or mechs into taking down the errant crash balls.
The districts adjacent to the area where the Vandals established their beachheads hosted plenty of turrets as well.
Any Vandal the Vesians took out now would be one Vandal they didn’t have to face on the battlefield.
"Those bastards! Next time, we better not take any prisoners!" Ves cursed as he programmed a last minute course change to take him further away from the center of Neron City.
[COURSE CHANGE INTERRUPTED. RESERVE FUEL: 0 PERCENT REMAINING.]
His ball expended its last remaining available reserve of fuel, and it was barely enough to get him to the furthest edge of the mech workshop district. Fortunately, the district looked a little rundown and held nothing of importance, so the Vesians didn’t bother posting a turret in this area.
As his crash ball neared the surface of Neron City, his crash ball expended the final remaining bits of fuel and power it reserved to make a safe landing. A powerful antigrav module came to life, allowing the final landing boosters to slow down its fall to a more controllable descent.
For a moment, Ves felt as if he was weightless.
The next, a firm thud pushed him against the cushions as his crash ball embedded itself into an abandoned and overgrown park.
The ball finally fell apart after that. Ves shakingly emerged from the remnants of the broken ball and shook his hazard suit to get some life back into his limbs.
"So this is Neron City."
The twin suns just started to fall under the horizon. Nevertheless, plenty of flames lit up the darkening skies in the distance. Weapons fire and mechs clashing against each other could be heard from the distance.
The entire planet fell into turmoil, and as Lord Javier’s seat of power, Neron City bled the most.
Ves almost felt sorry for the citizens, but he quickly reminded himself that he wasn’t one of them. "The entire planet is my enemy."
The mech workshop district sat in the furthest reaches from the center of the city. It held a very poor location, being far away from the spaceport and the well-developed infrastructure that supported the manufacturing complexes on the other side of Neron City.
The only thing the district had going for was that beginning mech designers could easily rent a workshop for a pittance. They could also hire cheap manpower from the slums in the neighboring cities, though that also caused this part of town to be ridden with petty gangs and crime.
A gang member happened to spot a crash ball landing in the abandoned park. He didn’t recognize the object and only thought it might be some space debris separated from a ship.
"Ol’ lucky me! Anything that can survive entry is bound to fetch a few hundred sovvies."
The Vesia Kingdom utilized the nova sovereigns as their state-wide currency. Almost everyone referred to them as sovvies, and they held a value roughly twenty-five percent weaker than a bright credit.
To an average bottom feeder, a few hundred sovvies was more than enough to live on for a month or two. The gang member eagerly climbed over the rusted fence and entered the overgrown park. He pushed his way past the wild bushes and long grasses until he finally reached a small clearing with a lot of cooling debris.
"Treasure!" The man’s eyes lit up and he practically threw himself on his knees to touch a piece, only to scald his hand from the residual heat of the exterior part. "Hot hot hot!"
After blowing his fingers, the man turned his attention back to the pieces and smiled. "So much stuff! Maybe it’ll be enough to get a thousand sovvies!"
He had never owned so much money in a single instant. Everything went to pay for food, shelter and the occasional stimulants. Anytime he held more than a hundred sovvies, the money just seemed to slip through his fingers the next day.
As the man dreamt of what he would do with all of that wealth, his thoughts flew away when a thin, surgical laser beam pierced his head.
For a second, the dead gang member appeared to struggle with what had happened to him. The next, his body fell flat to the debris-strewn soil as his brain had completely given up the ghost.
Ves in his hazard suit emerged from behind a tree trunk with his Amastendira extended cautiously towards the corpse. The gang member looked dead, but was that truly so? He slowly inched forward until he was able to stretch out his armored foot and bump the motionless corpse.
After making sure the fellow was dead, Ves sighed in relief and held the man by his neck and quickly dragged him away. The landing site of his crash ball was a conspicuous spot and his landing here might have attracted someone else’s attention.
After reaching a thickly-grow portion of the park, Ves let down his guard and studied the corpse. Despite the awful damage done to the head, the poor chap’s remains hadn’t spilled onto the rest of his body, which was exactly what Ves intended.
He stared at the man’s cheap mass-produced clothes and compared them to his nearly spotless green mech designer uniform underneath his hazard suit.
The problem with his outfit was that it carried a couple of emblems and other trappings that marked him out as a mech designer in service to the Mech Corps. If Ves dared to stroll through Neron City’s anarchy-infested streets with these clothes, he’d be liable to get mobbed by hateful citizens who decried the disastrous invasion of the Flagrant Vandals.
"Sorry buddy. I need your clothes."
Ves disengaged from his bulky hazard suit and shed his mech designer uniform. Then, he proceeded to strip the corpse and draped them to his own bare body. Their stature fortunately matched somewhat, so Ves didn’t feel uncomfortable by their fit.
He also took the man’s cheap comm from his wrist, but Ves couldn’t manage to get past the security check. Alloc or Melkor would have been able to hack into it, but Ves had never learned how to hack a comm without assistance. He didn’t specialize in this field.
"Great. I’m going to need to get my hands on an unsecured comm."
His ultimate goal would be to return to the Vandal fleet up in space. Despite the destruction of a handful of ships, the Vandals should still be aiming to continue their operation. They invested too much resources to make this daring assault, and the loss of a handful of extremely expensive combat carriers only spurred them on. They needed to loot enough riches to compensate for their substantial losses.
"The only problem is that they’ve landed on the far side of the manufacturing complexes."
The Flagrant Vandals chose to land outside the city’s perimeters, but close to the district which held all of the major industrial complexes. It was obvious to everyone what the Vandals intended. Half-organized mech units of House Eneqqin’s household troops had already deployed a substantial amount of mechs to that district, but as far as Ves was aware of, their numbers couldn’t match the invading Vandals.
Making his way through Neron City’s various districts while bypassing rioters and loyalists sounded very daunting to Ves. However, he would rather take his chances than to sit tight and wait for rescue that might never come.
With his new clothes, at least he wouldn’t be mistaken as an enemy by the locals. With potentially the entire planet as his enemy, Ves could ill afford to be known as a stray Brighter who arrived from the stars.
After fiddling but failing to accomplish anything with the comm, he threw it on the ground next to his discarded clothes, his hazard suit and a stripped corpse. Ves extended the barrel of his Amastendira yet again and set it on a wider angle at a higher power setting.
VRUUSH!
As he fired the pistol at the pile on the ground, the wider beam caused the entire mess to melt or burn apart. A huge sizzle escaped from the body as a lot of its moisture evaporated into disgusting steam. Ves leaned away from the conflagration and tried to avoid breathing in the foul air.
The hazard suit took longest to melt down. It had been designed to withstand heat to some extent, but in the end it couldn’t resist the vast power of his Amastendira.
Once the suit turned into a molten puddle of alloys and composites, Ves released his finger off the trigger and shoved the weapon back into his intangible Inventory.
"That takes care of that."
Ves felt oddly guilty about killing the Vesian. He had been responsible for the deaths of several people, either directly or indirectly as was the case with supplying others with his mechs. Ves did not lose any sleep over this responsibility, but the act of killing another human being in person oddly discomforted him in the back of his mind.
He could have found another solution, such as breaking in one of the nearby structures or workshops and scavenge some clothing from there. He could have knocked the fellow out with a hefty bump on the head and stripped him without killing the lad.
"I can’t obsess over these what-ifs. Not with my life at stake."
He quickly got over his dilemma and resolved himself to escape from this planet. Ves was no saint, and he cared nothing for the lives of the people who lived on Detemen IV. Killing them was distasteful, but if it kept him alive, he would do whatever was necessary.
Ves moved from the park as casually as possible. He tried out various postures before settling for a slightly slouched one that mimicked the sleazy gang member that he turned into ashes.
The trouble was that it would be difficult to pass for a genuine local. Ves obtained no training in this regard, and the differences between Vesians and Brighters was large enough that one would instantly recognize the other as soon as they opened their mouths.
Ves wouldn’t be able to mimic the two defining cultural traits of a Vesian. First, their society was a lot more hierarchical, and even the commoners themselves split up their social class into several layers.
Second, the Vesians adopted a local accent that was slightly different from the Republic. They also used different idioms and word choices in some cases. Ves couldn’t mimic the Vesian voice at all, let alone the Detemen accent which was another subset of the Vesian accent.
He actually didn’t know too much about these differences, but his recent interactions with Iris taught him a lot more about the Vesians than he wanted to. It turned out that the things he learned about the Vesians might prove very helpful in his current predicament.
Ves moved in the direction of his destination, bringing him closer to the city proper. This far out, the streets only held a few workshops, and none of them looked to have been used in the past several years.
"Times are tough for them as well, huh?"
The Vesians must have drafted much of their bottom feeder mech designers as well. This led to many empty and abandoned mech workshops. Debt collectors, scavengers and thieves looted them empty. The scavengers even took away near-worthless objects such as towels or cutlery.
"Empty."
"Empty."
Empty."
Practically everyone looking to make a quick sovvie had picked the entire street of workshops clean. Ves wouldn’t be able to cobble up anything together with what little they left behind. He needed to go deeper into the district and break into a proper workshop.
Though entering deeper into Neron City scared him, Ves urgently needed to make something. He didn’t forget that the Vandals only allotted four days at most for their assault on Detemen IV. Ves needed to reach the Vandal beach head on the other side of the city in order to get away from his hellhole.
As Ves passed through several intersections, he met a couple of people on the streets. Most appeared to be tough guys looking to make some trouble. Ves kept his head down and tried to shuffle away as fast as possible from these types.
"Watch where you’re going, bunghole!"
Most people who looked at Ves stared at his dirt-encrusted clothes and dismissed him out of hand. They probably thought that Ves didn’t own enough wealth to make it worthwhile for them to rob him. One burly man thought otherwise.
"Watcha looking at? You looking at me? You looking at me?!"
The thug went as far as grabbing the hem of the stolen shirt.
"Let go." Ves softly said.
"How about... no. What are you gonna do about it?"
"Nothing much, except this!"
BANG!
Ves instantly punched the thug’s head with a sloppy hook. The incredible force behind the punch launched the Vesian across the street until he smacked against the wall of an abandoned workshop.
He felt something crunch with the punch, and he would bet that his accoster would never stand up again. He didn’t feel bothered at that, as thugs weren’t worth his time. Still, he attracted a lot of attention to himself. A few bystanders turned their gazes at him, prompting Ves to flee from this part of town in a quick jog.
A couple of minutes later, Ves arrived at a street that looked a little better than normal. A lot more thugs and gang members prowled the streets, but the workshops in this area looked like they were still in business, if only barely.
"This is more like it, though why are there so many people out on the streets?"
Ves shuffled forward and tried to act like he belonged. He made for a very poor actor, but the thugs weren’t the most discerning people. They had other things in mind. Ves listened to their hushed conversations.
"They say the Vandal raid has Boss Nyerson all up in a tizzy. Why else would he call us out here out of the blue?"
"Can’t blame him. I heard it’s hell downtown. What is our planet coming to? I’m glad that we escaped most of that. I hope Boss Nyerson keeps it that way."
Soon enough, a beat-up low-flying aircar arrived from the distance. The car obviously feared being taken out by anti-air batteries, so the car flew as low to the ground without scraping its bottom. After a while, the aircar reached the largest group of thugs and plopped itself flat on the ground.
A door opened and revealed a tall and muscled brute. The man’s scarred face turned into a grin.
"Boss Nyerson!"
"Boss! Are we doing it? Are we gonna smash the Salamanders?"
"We’re doing nothing of the sorts!" The brutish man barked back. His response surprised everyone who gathered here. "You dolts! I didn’t train my Lugnuts to go crazy at the first sign of panic! I feel ashamed you even suggest such a thing!"
"Yeah, but-but-but the rest of Dettie has gone crazy! Why shouldn’t we celebrate as well?"
"They’re only crazy because those damned rebels are riling everyone up. I don’t tolerate any of their people in my territory, and I’m glad I did because it’s as quiet as a mouse out here."
Most of the crowd still couldn’t accept such an outcome. So far, they helplessly watched on as the news portals broadcasted complete anarchy from the interior of Neron City. They badly wanted to join the fun as the destructive revel spilled out to several districts, except for theirs which was too remote.
"Think about it." Boss Nyerson said and stretched his arms around the workshops lining the streets. "How much sovvies do you think we earn for protecting these bunch of nerds? It’s a lot, especially added over time."
"But if we can loot their workshops, we can make off with millions worth of sovvies in fancy gear!"
"Stupid! How would we get rid of them? Do we even have the space to hide all of our loot before can sell them off to the black market? How will we be able to get rid of the tracking devices that they’ll surely be hiding?"
The Lugnuts kept trying to weasel Boss Nyerson into letting them go wild, but the strongest of them all remained staunch in the face of temptation.
"Lemme ask you this, how long do you think the rebels and the Brighters will stay?"
That shut everyone up.
"Days. Weeks, maybe, but not months, and there’s no chance they’ll be here to stay. Once they finally leave, what will happen to the rest? I can tell you now that the Immies will come down with their mechs and investigators and scoop out any troublemaker who helped them out."
"We aren’t helping the enemy! We just want to enjoy some of our dues, that’s all."
"Don’t try to fast talk me! I know what you’re up to, and I say you’re not getting any of that as long as I’m around!"
Ves listened from the outskirts of the loose crowd as Boss Nyerson blabbed on about his forty years of living on the streets and staying alive while all of his buddies overreached and met their ends. At the heart of it, Ves approved of his clear-headed approach.
Sadly, caution and calm wasn’t very conductive for his purposes.
"I don’t want to hear any trouble from you boys! We’re going to patrol our turf and kick anyone out that even hints at trouble. It’s boring work, but mark my words, the Immies will reward us well when they come to save us from the rebels and Brighters."
That sounded very bad for Ves. While he didn’t know how far their territory spanned, chances were high the Lugnuts would notice his presence and approach him. Once they had him under their sights, it would be very difficult to stay unnoticed.
As Boss Nyerson started issuing out specific orders, Ves slowly shuffled backwards while he readied the Amastendira. The fancy laser pistol gleamed obnoxiously from the streetlights out in the dark. The weapon had been designed for a noble, not an infiltrator.
Despite the risks, Ves nevertheless took his time to aim the weapon. He might have a bit of practice firing the weapon, but his aim would still be wobbly this far back from his target.
Just as Boss Nyerson spotted the gleam of the pistol aimed at him, Ves fired his weapon. A bright golden beam slashed out and tore past the ear of the big guy.
"Damn! I missed!"
Nyerson’s quick reflexes caused him to jump and roll to the side, but Ves wasn’t finished yet. He kept his finger on the trigger and raked his laser beam across the street until it hit the fleeing gang leader, instantly boiling his flesh and ended his life.
"Boss!"
"Kill him!"
"Run!"
Everything happened so fast that the Lugnuts could hardly process the blatant murder. Some of the men with quicker wits pulled out their guns and started to pepper Ves with badly-aimed shots, but he already dove into an alleyway between two workshops, thereby cutting everyone’s line of sight.
"After him!"
"No wait! It’s too dangerous!"
Around a third of the men looked like they wanted to take revenge, but inwardly the golden laser beam astonished them all. The Lugnuts generally used the cheapest laser weapons they could get their hands on, and the beams on those rifles and pistols only lasted a couple milliseconds or so.
A laser beam that kept burning at so much power that they could still feel the heat from their skin was worth a lot more than what they collectively earned in years.
"Who killed the boss?"
"No idea, but I’m out of here!"
Some panicked, some stood paralyzed while some scratched their heads, trying to figure out what to do next.
"The assassin’s probably a rebel. He probably didn’t like Boss Nyerson’s plan of staying put on our turf."
"So you say that the rebels kill the boss because he isn’t dancing to their tune?"
"Yeah."
A lot of Lugnuts still stuck around. As much as they feared the laser, the assassin already made a getaway.
"Hey, should we do what the rebels want?"
"Whadda ya mean?"
"You know, since Boss Nyerson got killed for doing nothing, shouldn’t we do the opposite instead?"
A brain lit up in their minds as they contemplated the idea. "The Boss thought it was a bad idea. It’ll attract attention from the Immies when they finally come and lay down the law."
"Those troops from Imodris won’t bother with small fry like us. They’ll have to butcher half the planet if they want to punish all the rioters. C’mon, this is our chance! There’s no guarantee the Immies will reward us if we do nothing, but if we can make a quick score today, we’ll be living like kings for the rest of our lives!"
This argument rapidly gained a lot of momentum. After a little bit of back-and-forth, the remnants of the Lugnuts quickly came to an agreement.
"LET’S SMASH THIS PLACE UP!"
It was as if they turned into barbarians. The Lugnuts might have acted meek in front of Boss Nyerson, but with nothing restraining them anymore, they didn’t hesitate to let their inner beasts wild.
Laughter, screams and threats hung in the air as the occupants of the workshops tried and failed to resist the deluge of gang members. Word of their antics began to spread and all kinds of lowlives crawled out of the woodwork to join in the fun.
The sight of so many people throwing the workshops into chaos emboldened the cowards and the weak. They gained enough courage to join in on the looting, thereby throwing the entire territory of the Lugnuts into chaos.
Ves shook his head as he kept to the shadows. He stared emotionlessly as he saw the businesses being looted, set on fire or smashed in various conditions. As everyone busied themselves into taking what they wanted from the workshops that built all of those big mechs, Ves quietly snuck to Boss Nyerson’s corpse, grabbed hold of the remnants and dragged it to the abandoned aircar.
None of the Lugnuts had attempted to loot their former boss, whether it was out of fear or respect, Ves didn’t know. As Ves entered the aircar and slammed the door shut, he rifled through Nyerson’s burned remains but found very little of value.
"A pistol, some data chips, a comm."
Ves had set his laser beam at a moderate power setting, but that was almost enough to burn most of Nyerson’s possessions to a crisp. Ves didn’t get anything he hoped for, causing him to sigh and throw the remains in the back seat of the aircar.
"Can I activate this car?"
Ves quickly explored the control panel of the car. He even bent down and detached a plate, allowing him to look at the insides of the car.
"Nothing."
Ves spotted nothing that he could use to take control. The aircar might look cheap and old, but Ves couldn’t even bypass its antiquated security systems.
He needed to find another ride. "Time for plan B, I suppose."
Ves exited the useless aircar and ran along the streets, heading slowly but surely towards the center of the city. None of the rioting Lugnuts or lowlives spared a glance at him. For one, he was dressed as shabbily as them. Secondly, Ves didn’t look like a person who held a lot of valuables.
This allowed him to reach what he suspected to be the edge of the Lugnuts territory. Beyond the intersection up ahead was another district of mech workshops that clearly looked like it had entered the advance state of rioting. A handful of wreckage formed a crude barrier that separated the two areas.
As ugly and awful as it looked, it formed an effective wall against rioters on foot. This insulated the Lugnuts from much of the trouble ahead.
Not a lot of Lugnuts had reached this area yet, but a handful of clever hooligans opted to start breaking down doors from here, far away from where most the Lugnuts let loose.
"The Lugnuts have finally done it."
"It was about time they did something. We’ve been waiting on the streets for half a day now."
They neared the door of a workshop and banged at it with their fists. "Open up! We’re the tax collectors, and your taxes are due!"
A crackling speaker came to life. "Bugger off! I got nothing worth your time! Go loot the workshop down the street! He recently upgraded his assembly system, that’s gotta be worth a lot!"
The troublemakers looked at each other and nodded. One of them held out a scuffed laser rifle and aimed it at the door before proceeding to pepper it with bursts of laser beams.
To its credit, the door held out against the heat. It would take a decent amount of time for the lasers to burn through.
"I’m telling you, open up, or you won’t like it when we finally pry it open."
"You can go to hell! Don’t come inside, I’m armed!"
The men laughed. "A nerd like you can hardly hurt a fly!"
As the men already started dreaming about how much loot they could make off from emptying out this workshop, Ves sneaked up behind the men and unceremoniously unleashed a nearly full-powered laser beam from his Amastendira. He raked the beam from left and right, which vaporized the abdomens of every looter gathered together.
Ves walked over the corpses with his pistol held out before reaching the door. He knocked at it once and spoke out calmly. "Open up this door, or I’m turning this gun on you."
"Hyiii!! Please don’t shoot! I’ll open it, I’ll open it!"
A tone rang and locks disengaged. The door slid open, allowing Ves to enter the dingy interior of one of the shabbiest workshops that he had ever seen.
Ves realized midway throughout his journey that he wouldn’t be able to access any of the machines in the workshops without the right credentials. His lack of equipment and means seriously limited his options. He urgently needed to gear up, and that meant he couldn’t walk past the workshops without doing something.
Thus, he came up with a plan on the spot. Killing Boss Nyerson was a spur of the moment decision, but it succeeded in throwing his turf into chaos. With everyone thinking about scoring a lot of riches, an outsider like Ves would have much more room for maneuver.
It also put a lot of fear in the mech designers and workers that still occupied these workshops.
Ves looked around with care, wary for an unexpected ambush. The man on the other end of the line sounded frightened, but Ves couldn’t help but shake the feeling that it might have been an act.
"Where are you? Come out!"
Ves stopped and started to think. What would a poor, impoverished mech designer rely on when he owned a dingy mech workshop in a remote district of Neron City? With thugs of all kind roaming the streets, he didn’t believe a cowardly mech designer would roll over without a fight.
He looked around the long but narrow interior of the mech workshop. It had been built for the purpose, featuring strong ceramic walls that could withstand any industrial accidents, and from the abundant marks of age, plenty of mishaps had happened over the years in this humble building.
The mech designer who spoke over the speakers was probably the latest in a long line of owners.
Ves began to look around some more and studied the aged, rusted machinery and the haphazardly strewn tools. Even if the workshop was at such a poor state, this mech designer should have treated his gear with more respect. Leaving them out in the open for anyone to bump their feet onto the obstacles was a sign of an incredible level of sloppiness.
For a moment, Ves felt like an inspector who had been tasked with the unenviable job of evaluating the safety of this workspace environment. He only stepped through the front and already he could write an entire report on the violations he had seen.
"Where are you? Step out!"
No one responded. None of the speakers crackled to life to convey the high-pitched voice of the mech designer who occupied this dark and silent mech workshop.
Ves tried to put himself in the opposite man’s situation again. What would he do against anyone who tried to invade his mech workshop when he was all alone?
"A mech designer operating a mech workshop by himself can rely on at least one thing... bots!"
Just as he realized this thought, a surge of bots hovered into the front hall. Over three-dozen bots of varying shapes and sizes haphazardly stormed over the Ves. The heavier bots wielded unfinished plates of mech armor while the smaller bots wielded a variety of clubs or shabby laser pistols.
Though shabby, such a chaotic group of bots would likely have been able to defeat the group of thugs that originally intended to break into this workshop. As far as ingenuity went, the mech designer came up with a decent plan.
Too bad he faced Ves.
Although the bots looked deadly, they were industrial bots, not war bots. They didn’t excel in the battlefield, as evidenced by their fairly slow speed and the awful accuracy of their laser shots. Ves merely had to dive behind a corner in order to shield himself against the lasers.
Still, pathetic or not, Ves would certainly suffer if those bots came close and pressed him between several plates.
"I’ve got to take them out before they get close!"
He extended his Amastendira and set it at a fairly high power level. Just like before, he unleashed a thick, golden beam that hit the armor plating carried by the biggest bot.
Perhaps a regular laser weapon would have splashed uselessly against the mech-grade armor plate, but the Amastendira was an entire class of laser pistols in itself. The gun in itself had been designed to overcome weaker mechs, and its high-powered potency didn’t disappoint.
The armor plate the bot carried succumbed remarkably quickly. Ves did not expect anything different, as he vaguely recognized it as one of the cheapest armor formulas available. He slashed the laser beam from left to right, causing the other improvised shield bots to split apart and burn on the spot.
"My bots! No!"
Ves could hear desperation, but not to the point of giving up. Those bots were very valuable and served a vital purpose in keeping this workshop running. The mech designer shouldn’t keep risking his bots like this when his shield bots had all been taken out in a single hit.
What was he relying on?
Only a few seconds passed before Ves smelled something funny in the air. He sniffed and stretched out his tongue, only to taste something that resembled something rotten.
"Poison!"
His body had already started to heat up, a sign that it actively started to resist a poisonous element. Ves hadn’t felt this warm since his body first transformed on Groening IV.
Back then, he could easily breathe the toxic air of a completely alien planet. A tiny bit of poison synthesized by an impoverished mech designer posed no threat to his health. His body always heated up according to the severity of the threat, and right now he barely felt warmer than his normal condition.
"Nice try, but poison won’t work on me! Now stop your stupid shenanigans or I’ll destroy all of your bots! This is my final warning! Surrender now, or I’ll wreck all your stuff and try my luck at another workshop!"
A brief pause stretched after he delivered those words, but eventually Ves could hear the bots flying back from where they emerged.
"I give up! Please don’t do anything! This workshop isn’t mine, I rented it! I’ll be in so much trouble if anything gets broken!"
After a short while, Ves reached the end of the structure and climbed some steps until he reached the control room where the mech designer governed the entire workshop. Ves carefully trained his Amastendira at the skinny thirty-something year old man who was undoubtedly the mech designer of this workshop.
"What’s your name?"
"Filkis Kwan! Mister.. Can you please not point that gun at me?"
"Only if you prove you’re unarmed."
Filkis emptied his pockets and removed his coat, leaving him in an oil-stained shirt and a pair of faded pants. Once Ves inspected the man and insured he didn’t hide some holdout weapon in his underwear, Ves lowered the Amastendira, though he hadn’t let down his guard yet.
"Well Filkis, if you do as I say, I’ll be gone before you know. Disobey me, and I won’t hesitate to flash-boil your entire head with my laser pistol. Understand?"
"Yes, yes, yes, I understand!" Filkis nodded so vigorously that it looked as if his head would bob off entirely.
"Turn on the command console and show me a status of this workshop. I want a list of all your assets and whatever stock you have in your inventory."
Filkis stared at Ves as if he was an alien. It took some time, but he finally realized something dreadful about Ves. "Your accent! You’re no Dettie. You’re a Brighter!"
"I am." Ves admitted without any compunction. The truth would have come out eventually. "Don’t forget that I’m the one with the gun here, so you better do as I say."
Filkis nodded again and again before opening up the command console to Ves.
Once Ves browsed the lists, he became a little disappointed. Filkis was truly one of the lowest order of independent mech designers he ever had the pleasure to meet.
The 3D printer was from the earlier days of the last generation, and it had not aged particularly well after changing hands over a dozen times.
The assembly system looked a little better, but Ves had just destroyed all of the heaviest bots that were supposed to perform the most demanding duties.
All in all, the machinery would only be able to fabricate the most inferior bottom-tier mechs, and their quality wouldn’t be much better than a wreck scavenged straight from a brutal battlefield.
Thus, it came to no surprise that Filkis didn’t do a lot of business. His workshop stayed idle for weeks at a time, and his inventory contained so little stock that he was dependent on advance payments.
"You’re one of the saddest excuses of a mech designer that I have ever seen." Ves commented, sparing no mercy in his words. "Frankly, it’s a waste of time for you to rent this workshop and try and make it on your own. You’d have better luck if you enlisted in the Mech Legion or joined a scavenger fleet and made a living restoring broken mechs."
"I-I know.." Filkis bent his head. "The Mech Legion didn’t want me, and I don’t have the connections or qualifications to join another employer."
"Really? You’re that bad?" Ves frowned. Even the most incompetent mech designer could still be employed as an overqualified mech technicians. There were no useless mech designers. "How did you even graduate if no one wants to hire you?"
"I ahh.. I missed my final semester. I technically didn’t graduate..."
Ves couldn’t help but palm his face. While a mech designer didn’t necessarily need a degree in order to achieve success, Filkis obviously wasn’t one of those rare exceptions. He started to regret invading this mech workshop. He should have gone for the ones next door.
He briefly contemplated killing Filkis and trying his luck elsewhere, but figured that the other workshops might not be better off. This area seemed to be the dumping ground for the most incompetent mech designers.
Besides, Ves didn’t need to rely on Filkis to fabricate his gear. He only needed to borrow his credentials in order to operate the workshop.
Killing Filkis wouldn’t be helpful because his death would lock out all of the systems to Ves. While it was possible for Filkis to transfer his rights to Ves, that wouldn’t stick if Filkis died immediately after. Outdated as they were, the production machines came with tons of safeguards that Ves wouldn’t be able to overcome on his own.
So for better or worse, Ves needed Filkis alive.
"Do you have a galactic net connection?"
"Uh, of course? Why?"
Thank the heavens! As soon as Filkis opened the galactic net interface, Ves pushed him to a corner where he could easily shoot the coward if he moved and started typing in a couple of addresses.
After spending many months without receiving news of the outside galaxy, Ves was starving for news. He first browsed a couple of news portals and tried to look up the news on the LMC.
"Hmm, they’re doing well for themselves."
Ves dared not to linger too long on this topic. He only read enough articles to confirm the LMC continued to grow and sold a lot of Crystal Lords and Blackbeaks. The two iconic mech models had really started to make a splash in the Bright Republic’s mech market.
He looked up the current state of the war after that. The frontlines still looked like a giant back-and-forth, with neither side gaining the edge. The Bright Republic held off the furious Vesian assaults for now. The Mech Legion already showed signs of exhaustion, and it wouldn’t be long before they became too winded to continue their invasion.
Strangely enough, news about the Flagrant Vandals arriving in the Detemen System had also spread. The news was fragmentary as too many dubious sources wanted to put in a word, but overall the Vesians didn’t hold out hope that the Detemen System could repel the Vandals by themselves.
After a couple of minutes of apprising himself of the current news, Ves turned back to his immediate needs. Knowing the state of the war wasn’t as important as getting back to the protective embrace of the Vandals.
To that end, Ves visited a couple of murky places on the galactic net. He navigated to coded areas and inputted a lot of passwords before retrieving a batch of highly encrypted archives.
Once he downloaded the archives to the workshop’s systems, he disengaged the galactic net and unlocked them by inputting even more passwords. He also verified his identity by letting the command console take some samples of his body.
Ves grinned as he overcame the final hurdle. Within the encrypted vault of the archive he retrieved from the galactic net, a whole database of equipment designs revealed itself to his eyes.
"Now I’m in business."
These weren’t mech designs. Instead, every design consisted of every possible equipment that Ves might need to survive on a inhabitable or uninhabitable planet. With these designs, he could fabricate anything from aircars to comms to hazard suits, all of them in dozens of different variations to suit the resources at his disposal.
"Sorry Filkis, but I’m going to have to borrow your production line."
The Vesian mech designer practically cried when he heard those words.
Ves experienced too many close shaves with death. Some of those incidents wouldn’t have been so bad if Ves just made some better preparations beforehand. Therefore, after the Glowing Campaign, he began to setup several contingency plans.
One of his plans entailed obtaining many different equipment designs. If he ever needed something urgent, and possessed access to the galactic net, he would always be able to retrieve his database of designs and put them to use whenever he had access to a workshop.
Normally, acquiring such a vast database of designs was hard. Equipment manufacturers dearly prized their best designs and did everything they could to keep them out of circulation. Ves had to ask Dietrich to utilize his connections to the black market to obtain this valuable catalog of illegally obtained designs.
"Illegal or not, it hardly matters when my presence in the Detemen System is already an affront."
Ves started to select some choice devices to fabricate. His choice list included a decent-quality comm, an aircar that integrated a couple of stealth and ECM systems and a set of light combat armor.
He only hesitated on which backpack module he should choose. The light combat armor suit featured a modular slot in the back that could fit all kinds of auxiliary systems, from smoke generators to a powerful communications array.
"Right now, the most important priority for me is to go from A to B. I need to reach the Vandals, preferably without getting shot by my own side."
Ves was acutely aware of his current state of dress. His shabby outfit marked him as one of the many hoodlums that prowled the alleyways of Neron City. It was hardly an appearance that befit a mech designer.
"Getting a communications array will help me get into contact with the survivors of the Stubby Growler’s destruction."
After a moment of consideration, he reconsidered and went for a poor man’s version of a stealth module.
He truly wanted to pick the communicator, but other doubts stayed his decision. Trying to communicate with the Vandals risked being intercepted by the Vesians. That was why he didn’t try to contact the Vandals through the galactic net either. The Vandals didn’t care too much for the galactic net, and it was far too easy to be mistaken as a prankster.
Considering that he had to traverse across the entire city, some of it by foot, then a stealth backpack made more sense. It was nowhere near as effective as the stealth augment of his old comm, but it would help him hide from unfocused scans and weak recorders, making it a little bit more difficult for the Vesians to hone in on him once he entered a more densely populated area of Neron City.
The only problem now was that even if he picked the most basic versions of these designs, the workshop still lacked too many critical materials to fabricate them all. Ves scowled at Filkis.
"Your stock of materials is so poor. What have you been fabricating your mechs with? Most of your inventory is filled with junk!"
"I can’t work with anything more expensive! They’re harder to shape and too expensive for me to obtain."
"Show me your designs."
"Pardon?"
Ves extended his hands. "I want to see how good you are. Let me see your designs."
Filkis obviously didn’t wish to embarrass himself in front of a more superior mech designer, but Ves was the one with the gun here. Filkis unwillingly displayed his complete design schematics through the command console’s projector.
Ves studied the handful of designs. All of them fell in the light weight class, and consisted of variants of the same base model. However, the biggest thing to note was that the design actually depicted a felinid bestial mech.
Basically, it looked like a light and lean mech-sized cat.
Though its lines looked elegant, underneath it all he spotted several crude modifications to its internals. The base model originally came with sharp alloy claws, but for some reason Filkis wanted to replace them with heated blades. This required an extensive overhaul of the limbs, something which even Ves needed to be careful.
Filkis seemingly didn’t know the meaning of care in the way he brutally ripped away important portions to the functioning of the limbs.
"Did the MTA even certify this variant?"
"Uh, not yet. It’s my latest version and I’m still working on it..."
"If you want my advice, drop this variant now. It belongs in the trash can. Stick to the base model instead and understand how it works before you make an attempt at messing with things beyond your understanding."
Ves did not feel the need to spare the feelings of a Vesian mech designer. Out of professional courtesy, he gave Filkis the best advice he needed to hear.
The Vesian did not look pleased. "Am I really that bad?"
"You should have pursued another career instead of chasing to become a mech designer."
If Ves continued putting Filkis down, he had no doubt he could drive the Vesian to suicide. It was just that Filkis was just so bad as a mech designer. He wasn’t someone who had recently entered the industry and still had much too learn. The man toiled in the most awful conditions and had never been able to elevate himself to a higher tier.
Ves even started to pity Filkis.
"Alright, since it seems like you don’t have the materials I need, I’ll just have to get them elsewhere. Where is the nearest warehouse? Do you know any mech designers that stockpile a lot of raw materials?"
"I know of one guy who’s better off than most. He operates the mech workshop down the street. There’s also a small depot at a nearby crossroads that sells some of the rarer materials for mech designers in a pinch."
"Great! Lead the way!"
The next hour, Filkis led Ves towards a handful of promising locations that held the things he needed. This time, Ves did not feel inclined to waste any time, and straight up smashed through the facilities and overpowered every obstacle in his way. The Amastendira’s awesome power completely dominated his opposition.
Since Ves didn’t need to borrow their machines, he didn’t hold any qualms about killing them. Filkis watched horrified as the corpses of his former rivals lay dead on the floor as Ves proceeded to ransack their storerooms for the materials he needed.
Bots continued to bring more and more materials to Filkis’ workshop. The line of bots occasionally attracted attention, but Ves decisively shot his Amastendira at anyone who thought they could get a piece of the action. Eventually, the scorched and fallen bodies deterred any other opportunists from messing with his looting operation.
With the collection of a handful of junk exotics, Ves proceeded to fabricate the most essential piece of gear for him. A comm geared towards hacking.
While Ves wasn’t a hacker, Melkor taught him how to hack simple machines using automated scripts and software. With the help of these tools, he should be able to hack some easy gear.
It took only fifteen minutes to complete the delicate wrist comm device. Ves needed to exert a fair amount of precision to maintain control over the fabrication of such a small and delicate device.
While Ves mainly fabricated mechs, that didn’t mean he wouldn’t be able to fabricate anything smaller. Mechs used plenty of tiny, delicate components so fabricating a comm was still within his skillset.
The only trouble about this particular model was that its hacking modules demanded several high-quality trace exotics to be able to work at its best. Ves needed to raid four different locations before he finally gathered all of the requisite materials.
Ves kept his original comm on his right wrist, but put his hacking comm on his left wrist. He grinned as soon as he turned it on and installed a custom operating system that came with the design. "Now I’m in business."
Obtaining the hacking module made his life ten times easier. Ves immediately entered the other workshops and unceremoniously hacked whatever bots survived his initial intrusion. Their outdated models and simple programming provided zero challenges for his hacking comm.
With the appropriation of so many bots, many more materials started pouring in Filkis’ workshop. Ves rapidly made use of the abundant supply of materials by fabricating his next pieces of gear.
First, he formed his light combat armor. As none of the workshops he visited held an alloy compressor, Ves had to make due with an inferior variant that wouldn’t be able to withstand a lot of hits. It was better than fabric, at least, so Ves made do with what he produced.
Next up, he fabricated a small and boring-looking aircar. It didn’t look different from any vehicles that graced the skies of Neron City. Ves even took the time to tweak its outer appearance to ensure that it would blend in with the crowd.
The aircar actually hid some surprises underneath. Besides stuffing in some stealth and ECM systems, Ves also incorporated much better armor, enough to withstand a couple of projectiles.
The aircar obviously took the longest to finish. The skies already started to glow as the twin suns emerged from the horizon by the time that Ves put the finishing touches on the vehicle.
As Ves smiled in satisfaction at the products of his labor, Filkis let out a sigh of admiration.
"Impressive! You are truly impressive! You work so fast, but you never lost control. How did you do it?"
Ves only became this good due to the System, but he would never tell Filkis the truth. Instead, he spun a convenient line of nonsense.
"It’s nothing. The main difficulty in upping your fabrication ability is to master your theoretical knowledge. This goes double for a dropout like you. Just because you’ve left your school doesn’t mean you should stop learning something new. Achieving success in mech design is highly dependent on what you are capable of, and the only way to expand your capabilities in mech design is to keep studying. Even I never stopped learning something.
"Textbooks are too expensive." Filkis muttered. "I can’t afford the good books that cost hundreds of thousands of sovvies to buy."
"Knowledge is expensive, you know. If your budget isn’t big enough to buy a good book, then buy a cheaper one. I know for certain that there are many textbooks for sale that only cost a couple of hundred credits. Sure, their contents will be rather shallow, but a mech designer of your level won’t understand the subtleties incorporated in the more expensive books."
This gave Filkis some food for thought. The cheaper books often contained very little material of substance, and were often written by Novices or Apprentices desperate for money.
FIlkis began to grow on Ves a little. The man seemed so unthreatening that Ves didn’t feel inclined to kill him anymore. Perhaps he would make a name for himself one day after he finally moved beyond this difficult time.
As Ves loaded his aircar with a couple of supplies and other gear he scrounged from the workshops, Ves turned back to Filkis and waved goodbye.
"It was nice knowing you. Sorry about holding you at gunpoint, but needs must."
"I.. I hope you don’t return."
"Haha!" Ves laughed. "Me neither!"
Filkis finally breathed a sigh of relief once Ves stepped inside the aircar and departed his workshop. As the aircar hugged the ground and hovered away, Filkis watched on from the ruined front entrance and contemplated the aftermath.
"He wrecked my bots and looted the neighboring workshops and didn’t even have the decency to take responsibility!"
Too many signs led back to his workshop that Filkis felt highly unsafe. As much as he wanted to stick it out in this workshop he called home for several years, it was time for him to move on. He did not want to take the blame for anything the invader might have done.
"Damnit, where can I go?"
As his newly fabricated aircar carefully traversed the dangerous streets of Neron City, Ves needed to pay attention to a lot possible threats.
Rioters and troublemakers revelled in the streets, brandishing their weapons as they helped themselves to goods normally out of their reach. Too many businesses burned due to a complete absence of law and order. Ves wondered where the local Planetary Guard had gone.
"Did Lord Javier recall them all to defend his own hide?"
Whatever the case, the total lack of authority on the streets brought out the best and worst out of every citizen left behind. As his aircar discretely flew over their heads, he spotted lootings, rioting and senseless destruction.
Detemen IV obviously hadn’t been governed very well, because the outskirts of Neron City hosted an enormous underclass of people who felt they had nothing to lose.
Still, various communities and neighborhood associations banded together as well to protect their homes and businesses against the jackals that wanted to take what they wanted. Occasionally, fighting between different groups broke out on the streets, and Ves often had to take a detour if he didn’t want his aircar to be hit by a stray projectile.
After a long time of very slow and very cautious flight, his aircar finally left the slums and entered into the city proper. The residential areas he flew over seemed more orderly and cleaner, though the area hadn’t completely escaped the anarchy that gripped the planet.
A lot less random thugs prowled the streets, but in their stead Ves spotted far more organized gangs sporting much better gear. Ves needed to rely more and more on his stealth systems to get by, but that didn’t help much when someone spotted his aircar flying by with the naked eye.
"Aircar! Touch down immediately or be fired upon!"
"Yeah, no thanks!"
Ves responded by maxing out his propulsion. The aircar quickly lurched forward with a hail of lasers and projectiles peppering his wake.
The only problem with moving so fast was that his aircar’s stealth systems became ineffective. Other gangs in the aircar’s path detected the vehicle flying above their turf and responded with violence.
Due to its flimsy construction, the aircar couldn’t withstand too much damage. Its bottom became increasingly scarred as long-ranged infantry fire occasionally scored a lucky hit.
Ves watched with distress as the integrity of the aircar declined at a rapid tempo.
"Damn these thugs! Don’t they have better things to do than shooting an aircar out of the sky?"
No one traveled in the air during times of turmoil. It was too easy to be mistaken as an enemy, and flying a vehicle above the heads of others had a tendency of making most of them uncomfortable.
Flying in the air also happened to be a bad idea because any vehicle that flew above the cityline would be horribly exposed to fire.
After a small missile hit the rear of his aircar, Ves cursed again and lowered the altitude of his car. He didn’t like travelling so low through the streets, but it would at least cut off the line of sight of attackers from the neighboring streets.
Unfortunately, lowering his altitude also exposed him to the armed people in his path. As the car accumulated more damage, its stealth systems became increasingly less effective.
"What’s that?"
"It’s an aircar! Shoot it down!"
Flying through the latest barrage of fire directed in its way caused the car to finally reach its limit. An important antigrav module lost power, causing the vehicle to be unable to keep it aloft. Ves desperately controlled the aircar’s descent into a controlled crash.
Bang!
The aircar hit the street with a firm thud and slid forward with whatever forward momentum it had left. Once the battered vehicle stopped its slide, a door banged open and an armored figure jumped out.
"Someone came out!"
"Get him!"
More than two-dozen gang members approached his position. Unlike the lowlives Ves had encountered before, this gang exhibited much more coordination. They spread out and tried to encircle his position before assaulting him from several directions at once.
Ves considered his options, but found no better option than fighting his way out. He patted his light combat armor. Though it was made of fairly low-class materials, it still beat anything else the gang members used as armor.
He also possessed the Amastendira, which proved to be a decisive edge against his assailants.
"Die!"
Ves hid behind the wreckage of his aircar and shot at each exposed gang member. Though he missed more than he liked, many of his targets met their end when he simply readjusted his faulty aim with the beam still on. This made it incredibly easy for him to take out the opposition.
As he explicitly targeted anyone that seemed to be the leaders, Ves only killed five of them before they broke. The Amastendira’s powerful capabilities completely intimidated the survivors, especially since Ves proved that even cover offered little protection against its powerful beams.
Still, routing the criminals came at a significant cost. The Amastendira only retained half a charge, and needed a lot of time to recharge by itself. "I can’t afford to get dragged into another fight."
Besides, his light combat armor wasn’t invincible either. Ves aimed to fabricate the stealthiest mechs with the resources at hand, and similar to designing mechs, Ves needed to make a lot of painful tradeoffs. Thick armor didn’t mesh well with stealth.
"I’ve got to gear up again." Ves concluded as he studied the map projected by his helmet. He downloaded a map of Neron City from the galactic net, but it didn’t help him out too much because it didn’t depict the territories owned by the different gangs that held sway on the streets.
He eventually found a mid-sized mech workshop a few kilometers down the road to the center of the city. This workshop was much larger than the shabby excuses he had used last time. A better workshop would certainly contain better machines and resources. He already started to salivate at the thought of what he could fabricate with all of those goodies.
He sighed. "It’s going to be tough getting past these stupid gangs."
Nevertheless, he decided to go forth, because he wouldn’t be able to last forever on foot. He engaged his backpack module’s stealth systems, which due to the lack of quality materials didn’t do much but block long-range scans. It didn’t make him invisible and neither did it block anything powerful, but at the very least nobody seemed to be hunting him down.
As Ves slowly took to the side streets and avoided every possible contact his combat suit’s sensors detected up ahead, he also took in the sights.
A storm had already swept through some of the streets he passed. Currently, he made his way through a residential district comprised of apartment blocks, and some of them had been burned or emptied out already. Others seemed to hide a lot of scared and frightened Vesians. A few of them even peeked out their windows before drawing back their heads at the sight of an armored figure.
"Help! Help!" A woman screamed as a laughing group of people in gang colors dragged out several families from an upscale apartment block.
Men, women, girls and boys got beaten and lurched around as several gang members stormed their apartments and took out anything that seemed valuable.
Others had other intentions in mind. They gazed at their prisoners with depraved expressions.
"Hahahaha! First dibs on me!"
"Unhand me, you brute! I am the secretary of the Ailmont Carrie, the personal dog trainer of Lord Javier himself! When Mr. Carrie and our Lord finds out about this, there won’t be any corner in the galaxy that can keep you safe!"
A few gang members faltered in their revelry at those words. Although she didn’t occupy a very high position, her connections alone elevated her to a completely different class than the rest.
"What are you scared about?!" One gang member yelled at his comrades. "Lord Javier is a goner soon! This is our chance!"
"Yeah! This hag has been strutting around with her nose pointed at the sky for far too long now! It’s time she gets what is coming for her!"
"No! Mr. Carrie won’t forgive you for this!"
It was obvious what the gang members intended for their captives. Ves quietly shook his head under his helmet and took a very wide detour around the congregating gang members. As much as his decency urged him to come to the rescue of innocents, he held no obligation to defend Vesian citizens.
They were still his enemy, after all. In fact, he should be glad to see Vesians turning against themselves. Ves would rather see them turn to infighting than to face a united front that maintained complete control over their own territory.
Thus, even as children screamed and men got shot, Ves closed his ears to the increasingly desperate pleas for help until he escaped far away for them to fade in the wind.
Ves encountered a few more incidents like this, mostly by gangs that got pushed out of the richer business streets that held the best loot. Unable to rob the best sites, they settled for the fancy homes occupied by higher-class commoners. While most were mainly out for goods like jewelry and luxury goods, others just wanted to get their hands on the people they formerly considered untouchable.
In short, a lot of disgraceful things happened in the apartment buildings he snuck past. The only good thing about it was that the more these kinds of things happened, the fewer people would be on the streets.
In this way, Ves managed to cross a fair distance as the twin suns reached high above the sky. Once he reached the end of the latest residential district in his way, a signal suddenly crackled from his military comm.
"Mr. Larkinson?" An clipped female voice spoke. "Please respond."
Ves frowned and made his way towards an alleyway before responding through his combat suit’s communicator.
"Who is this?"
"My name is Lieutenant Burke. I am the former communications officer of the Rising Apple. Please check your comm, I’ve sent proof of my credentials."
The comm issued to him by the Flagrant Vandals couldn’t perform a lot of functions, but it did do a few things fairly well. One of the core functions in his military comm was to verify the identities of any Vandal. His comm only took an instant to verify Lieutenant Burke’s identity.
While it was possible that the woman who spoke over the comm had hacked the Vandal verification system, Ves thought it was unlikely for anyone to have done so. The Flagrant Vandals wouldn’t utilize this system if it could be hacked so easily.
"I believe you, lieutenant. What would you have me do?"
"We are in the process of rallying every survivor of the Stubby Growler and the Rising Apple that made it into Neron City. We could desperate use the help of a mech designer."
"Did you get your hands on some Vesian mechs?"
"Yes, but we are unable to penetrate their systems and get them to work for us. We need your help to unlock these mechs."
Ves closed his eyes. If they had trouble bypassing the security measures of the Vesian mechs, then Alloc probably wasn’t among their ranks. The Journeyman Mech Designer was a wizard with anything related to software, which meant he could be a scary hacker as well.
Hopefully he made it through the Stubby Growler’s destruction.
Ves opened his eyes and nodded. "If you need my help, my services are at your group’s disposal."
"That’s great! We’ve fixed your location through your comm. Stay put. We’ll be sending a retrieval party after you, ETA twenty minutes. If you’re spotted and under attack, please let us know. Out."
"Will do, lieutenant."
As Ves closed the channel, he felt a little mixed at the unexpected contact. He hadn’t expected to get in touch with the Vandals so soon, and certainly not with other survivors of the combat carriers that succumbed to the Vesian missile attack.
"Still, there’s safety in numbers. I’m no commando. I can barely sneak my way past apartment blocks. It’s going to be ten times worse once I reach the downtown area."
The retrieval party consisted of two exo-skeleton soldiers armed with looted gear. The scorch marks on their battered armor made it clear that they had survived entry into Detemen IV’s atmosphere with their suits instead of crash balls.
They tensed for a moment after spotting an armored figure. Ves made sure to keep his Amastendira safely tucked in his intangible Inventory and stay still, so the newcomers quickly dismissed him as a threat.
"Mr. Larkinson, please take off your helmet." One of them instructed through a comm channel.
Ves did as he told. As he exposed his face, one of the soldiers scanned him with a device integrated in his suit. Apparently, whatever it did finally seemed to satisfy the Vandal infantrymen. "Your identity checks out. Please come with us."
It was a very new experience for him to be escorted by two human colossi. Ves briefly admired their armored shells and spotted many commonalities with mechs. Naturally, an exo-skeleton suit wasn’t a downscaled mech, so it featured a lot of other systems entirely unique to this type of war machine.
"Can you tell me about how many Vandals have gathered?"
They seemed to hesitate for a moment before replying. "Some of us who made it off the Stubby Growler and Rising Apple have landed closely together and fought with the locals. After a night of hard fighting, we took control over the base of a medium-sized mercenary corps.
"Without any friendly mechs?"
"Our suits proved to be sufficient."
Ves genuinely expressed his admiration of their feat. To take on a mid-sized mercenary corps that possessed at least fifteen to thirty mechs or so would be a challenge to any group of shipwrecked survivors. He couldn’t even imagine how they had been able to overcome the mercenary mechs.
"Who’s in charge?"
"Captain Rosa Orfan. She’s the only mech captain among the group."
Ves hadn’t heard of her, so she was probably stationed on the Rising Apple. Most of the mech pilots among the Vandals had deployed their mechs in space at the time the Vesians launched their Heavensfall and XX-REXX missiles. The only ones who hadn’t been launched were the reserves and those responsible for piloting landbound mechs.
"How many mech pilots do we have?"
"Let’s reach the base first. Captain Orfan or Lieutenant Burke will brief you from there."
They silently made their way past wrecked aircars and wretched corpses. The fighting in this area was a lot more intense. Ves spotted signs of heavier weapon usage. He even noted the tell-tale signs of mechs stomping through the streets.
He was already burning with questions, but the two meatheads kept insisting that he should leave his questions for the officers. Grunts like them only learned how to operate their suits and to obey their orders. Nothing more.
Strangely enough, they encountered no resistance, mostly because the heavily armored soldiers already cleaned up the trash along the way. Ves spotted several corpses that had obviously been done in by the heavy ballistic rifles wielded by his escorts.
Just two of them wiped out an entire score of thugs. The disparity in power between the two and Ves couldn’t be more wider. As much as exo-skeleton suits lacked the allure enjoyed by mechs, both of them were powerful in their own right. They just served different purposes.
After a while, they finally reached a shabby base that used to be tidy before the Vandals invaded the Detemen System. The gates had been breached, and as Ves passed through them he realized why. The Vandals somehow hijacked a transport shuttle and crashed through.
Unfortunately, this led to a huge field of debris behind the gates that made it difficult for the three to find their footing. While the exo-skeleton suited men could crush some of the smaller stuff, the tougher alloys wouldn’t bend under their weight.
"You’ve got to clean this up."
"We have bigger priorities to take care of first."
After making it through the debris field, they entered a small office building sitting next to the mech stables. Ves entered the elevator alone and reached the top floor before someone else guided him to an office that formerly belonged to the mercenary in charge.
"Mr. Larkinson." A toned woman greeted behind the desk. "Please take a seat. We have some matters to discuss."
As Ves rested his armored form on the chair, he studied the captain sitting on the other side of the desk. Rosa Orfan looked like a typical mech pilot. Featuring the lean, muscled physique of a warrior trained to endure the rigors of mech combat, she looked like she meant business.
She pointed a dusky-skinned finger at him. "As of this moment, you are the first mech designer we’ve retrieved from the Stubby Growler and the Rising Apple. I had hoped to snag Mr. Alloc, but I guess we’ll have to make do with you. I hope you have no objections serving under me."
Her tone made it clear that she brooked no refusal. Not that Ves intended to refuse in the first place. Although he didn’t fall into the usual chain of command, in emergency situations like this, it was best to defer to the officer in charge.
"I will obey your orders to the best of my abilities, ma’am." Ves solemnly replied. "Although if I may ask, what are your plans? Have you made contact with the Vandals yet?"
Ves did not think that Captain Orfan’s little band had stayed out of contact with the main Vandal fleet. Earlier, he managed to browse the galactic net, so Captain Orfan or Lieutenant Burke must have certainly done the same.
"We made contact with the fleet as well as the local rebels." Orfan acknowledged with a nod. "It’s been decided that we won’t be returning to the main elements of the Vandals immediately."
Ves blinked at that. "We aren’t going back?"
"Not yet. Since we have already arrived at Neron City, we might as well pave the way for main ground force."
"Uhm, what are our objectives, ma’am?"
"Currently, the ground force doesn’t need our help in raiding the manufacturing complexes. We’re too far away from the industrial districts to provide any assistance anyway. Instead, we’ve been tasked with coordinating with the Detemen League in rooting out Lord Javier. There are strong signs that the scion of House Eneqqin is still within city limits."
"How can that be, ma’am? If I were him, I would have fled on a ship or deep underground."
"The rebels have ruled out both possibilities. They prepared a lot of anti-air batteries, and they’ve been very successful in shooting down anything that attempts to lift off from Neron City and its surroundings. As for escaping underground, the rebels are far more adept at this than Lord Javier. It’s their home turf. They already stopped a handful of digger vehicles from making it off."
Ves wasn’t sure about the effectiveness of the rebel blockades, but they had no choice but to believe in them. This so-called Detemen League must really hate Lord Javier if they went through the trouble of cutting his escape route above and below the ground.
"What are my duties?"
"Right now, the men and women under my command are doing everything they can to find any clues about the whereabouts of Lord Javier. The rebels have been at it for a while as well, so our assistance won’t amount to much. Still, I don’t think that Javier can escape our detection, because many mechs haven’t shown up at the defense line that House Eneqqin’s troops have erected to repel our main ground force."
Mechs were so big and heavy that it would be impossible to hide them from precise enough scans. Only mechs that featured excellent stealth systems possessed a chance at evading detection, and there was no way that House Eneqqin employed so many stealthed mechs.
Ves understood his duties. He needed to bring the mechs of the former mercenary corps under control, because they would be needed to join the impending hunt for Lord Javier.
"What kind of assets are at my disposal?"
"A handful of mech technicians of the Stubby Growler and the Rising Apple have made it through. They’ve been instructed to answer to you."
"There’s no chief among their ranks?"
"Sadly, no."
Ves would make do, but he didn’t like it. From his experience, mech technicians had a tendency to work half as much or less when chief technicians were absent. He hoped that the gravity of their situation sank into their stupid skulls. This was no time to slack off and take it easy.
"How many mech pilots do I need to provide with a mech?"
"This mercenary corps owned fourteen intact mechs. Currently, we’ve gathered five mech pilots excluding myself, so I want you to bring at least six mechs online. More Vandal mech pilots may trickle in at any time, so don’t think you’re done when you delivered six working mechs."
"Understood. I’ll continue to work on the mechs as long as my orders hold. One question, ma’am. Is the Detemen League providing any assistance?"
"They sent us a few containers worth of supplies to set us up, but they are not a fighting force that relies on mechs. Citizens from Detemen IV who have the potential to be mech pilots enjoy a lot of privileges from House Eneqqin. This makes them anathema to the Detemen League. Therefore, they won’t be able to provide us with mechs, mech pilots and supplies."
The true strength of the Detemen League lay in their influence over the auxiliary regiments. This wasn’t useful to the Flagrant Vandals because all of their proficiencies and fighting doctrines revolved around mechs and only mechs.
"Do they have a presence here?"
"No one except for a liaison they left behind. Most of their fighters are attacking House Eneqqin from their rear as we speak. It will only be a matter of time before they’re grinded between the rebels and our main ground force. The only members of the Detemen League that’s still spread over the city is tasked with securing supplies or finding the whereabouts of Lord Javier."
They were on their own for now. No one could spare anymore resources that might help with their predicament.
"May I ask something?"
"Permission granted." Captain Orfan leaned back in her chair. Ever since he accepted her command, she visibly eased some of her tension, as if a weight had been lifted off her chest.
"How important is it for us to find Lord Javier?"
Captain Orfan turned grave. "This is a very important mission. The Detemen League only acceded to the plans cooked up by Colonel Lowenfield and the Vesian Revolutionary Front because of our commitment to hunt him down. Leaving empty-handed will severely damage our standing with not only the League, but every other local rebel group as well. Our credibility and ability to sneak through Vesian space hinges on our success here."
Ves understood, even if he didn’t think that Orfan was as optimistic as she appeared. Ves could think of a hundred different ways he could hide his presence from the rebels and the Vandals. Lord Javier may be a dirtbag, but he sounded like the type who valued his life. No method was too unseemly if it could help him survive the manhunt on his head.
They talked a bit more and Ves received a bit more instructions before he left her makeshift office. Ves turned on his comm which already received a map of the former mercenary grounds. He followed the shortest route downstairs and walked over the the nearby mech stables.
As he approached the fairly quiet structure, he looked up at the name of the mercenary corps put up at the front.
JAVIER’S DASTARDLY HANDSOME BASTARDS
Ves smirked as he read it. The bastards probably incorporated Javier’s name to ingratiate themselves in his eyes.
"Well, I hope their mechs are up to snuff if Lord Javier has approved of their existence."
Only half a dozen mech technicians lounged in the mech stables. All of them appeared to be seasoned men and women, so at least Ves wouldn’t be dealing with inexperienced rookies.
He still wore his light combat armor, which would be suitable to wear among soldiers, but not among techs. So Ves removed his helmet before addressing the techs.
"My name is Ves Larkinson, and I’ll be taking charge from here on out." He stated simply, trying to channel his inner chief technician.
Having observed several chiefs in his brief career, Ves learned that they didn’t throw their weight around too much. They just seemed to radiate confidence that their word was law and that obedience was a given. The assumption of authority often times turned into actual authority.
In other words, as long as Ves pretended to be the boss, other people would see him as the boss.
"Who are you?" A burly woman asked with narrowed eyes. "We ain’t listening to brats like you. Scram!"
"I’m a mech designer."
That caused a couple of the mech technicians to laugh. "That’s all the more reason for you to get out! You useless nerds are all the same, thinking you can boss us simple-minded grease monkeys around. Well we grease monkeys know far more about putting mechs back together than you ever will!"
Ves understood what went on. They probably mistook Ves for a low-ranked mech designer that would often be assigned to supervise the mech technicians in the workshops and machine shops. Ves felt for some sympathy for the techs if they had been ordered to follow instructions from a sad sack of meat like Filkis.
However, Ves was not Filkis.
If the assumption of authority failed to go through their thick skulls, then maybe a more direct application of power would work. Ves walked closer and closer until he almost pressed his face against the chest of the tallest and presumably strongest mech technician.
"Will you listen to my orders, I do I have to teach you a lesson?"
Everyone grinned, and the tall guy crossed his meaty arms as if he faced an angry kitten. "You? Teach me a lesson? Are you even qualified?"
Though his combat armor gave him a bit of height, Ves couldn’t match the bulk of the tech in front of him. Nevertheless, Ves reared his armored fist back before punching forward. He deliberately telegraphed the move because he wanted to make a point.
All the techs including his target looked on with amusement. Light combat armor didn’t add any strength enhancements to the wearer like an exo-skeleton suit. Thus, they all expected this young and delicate-looking nerd to hurt his own knuckles.
What actually happened was the giant tech getting punched off his feet. His body slid backwards and landed in a painful heap. To his credit, the man didn’t scream out in pain, but his squirming made it clear that the punch had dealt a significant amount of damage.
"What are you?! You’re no mech designer!"
"You cheated! There must be some engine buried beneath his combat armor!"
"SILENCE!" Ves yelled. Though his voice sounded a little shrill, the apprehension he evoked among the techs with his punch caused them to take him seriously for once. "Fall in and report!"
After helping the tall guy up his feet, the techs all formed a line.
"We’re at your disposal, sir!"
They proceeded to get down to business. Ves toured the mech stables and workshop areas that the Vandals appropriated from Javier’s Dastardly Handsome Bastards. The techs pointed out a couple of details of each mech along the way, half of which consisted of light and medium bestial mechs.
All of the mechs hung silently in their berths, unable to be roused from their slumber without the right access credentials.
"Is anyone from Javier’s Dastardly Handsome Bastards left alive? We might have a chance of unlocking them with the help of a prisoner."
They all shook their heads. "We all thought of that before, but the Bastards ran away through an emergency escape tunnel when they realized they wouldn’t be able to hold the base. Every survivor got away clean."
"Damn." Ves sighed and looked at the fairly cheap but serviceable mechs.
The Flagrant Vandals needed these machines in working condition. Without mechs, the Vandals under Captain Orfan were only Vandals in name. Their ability to project power onto Neron City would be limited to just a few blocks from this former mercenary base.
"Have you managed to activate any mech through your own efforts?"
"No, sir." One of the technicians answered glumly. "We’ve tinkered with the hardware and software locks, and only managed to fudge the former a bit. We’re clueless when it comes to getting around the restrictions set by the operating system."
"Let me take a look."
Ves climbed up to the cockpit of a bestial mech and analyzed the interior. He borrowed a feel tools from the mech technicians that climbed with him and withdrew some panels to look at the electronic guts underneath.
"Well, the good news is that this is a fairly cheap and old mech model. Their security systems are relatively basic and I think it’s possible for me to fudge these components."
"Will we able to bring these mechs back online, sir?" The mech technicians glowed with hope. They finally started to acknowledge Ves as a competent mech designer.
"Not yet. These hardware locks are so basic that they’re only here to prevent some whiz monkey from hacking this mech from a distance. The true challenge for me is to overcome the security restrictions in the software."
A modern mech was not a giant mechanical clockwork that operated through hydraulics, steam pressure or ropes. Mechs were far too complex to rely on such simple and antiquated control methods.
Instead, a mech was more akin to a control center surrounded by thousands of different systems and subsystems.
To control such a gargantuan collection of mechanisms through simple commands was so ludicrous that any mech designer who proposed such a thing would be stripped of his accreditation and be booted from the mech industry!
Having worked under Alloc for a couple of times, Ves gained a new appreciation of the importance of good programming. The material components formed the body, while the programming acted as the mind that allowed the components to work in unison.
Therefore, the complete lock imposed by the operating systems by the mechs simply couldn’t be bypassed through any simple methods, such as wiping them out an installing new programming.
Ves either needed to work within the rules imposed by the operating system, or he needed to hack it in a way that didn’t trip any failsafes.
"I really wish Alloc was here. He would have unlocked these mechs with the snap of his fingers."
Sadly, the task fell to him. It was a good thing he wasn’t completely helpless in this regard. His self-made comm still contained a suite of hacking software. It should be able to hack most lastgen mech models below a certain price point, but the Dastardly Handsome Bastards happen to utilize currentgen mech models instead.
His bootleg hacking software might not be very effective, but the only way to find out was for Ves to make the attempt.
"Stand back." He instructed everyone else. "I’m going to attempt to hack the mechs. While I don’t think anything will happen if I fail, the Bastards may have booby-trapped them against attempts at theft."
The mech technicians obediently retreat. Ves even placed his helmet back on his head to form a completely protective seal.
"Here goes nothing."
Ves activated his hacking software and directed it to work on the bestial mech. Its console came to life and spat out a torrent of data, much of it Ves didn’t understand. After a minute or so of scrambling, the console finally displayed a very firm message.
[ACCESS DENIED.]
"It was worth a try."
Ves didn’t give up. He left the cockpit of that mech and tried to hack another one.
[ACCESS DENIED.]
Undeterred, Ves continued to cycle through several mech. When he reached the sixth mech, Ves finally received a different message.
[ACCESS GRANTED.]
"Yes! It worked!"
The bestial mech in question successfully came online. The cockpit bloomed to life as many different consoles lit up. Outside, its exterior lit up a bit as several lights blinked in different colors that corresponded to a standard startup sequence.
"Mr. Larkinson did it!"
If nothing else, his success truly cemented his authority over the mech technicians. When Ves squired out of the cockpit, he ordered them to ready the mech for action.
"Refuel this mech and perform some light service on it while you’re at it. Get it done within an hour as we can’t afford to keep it idle for long. We need to start the hunt for Lord Javier as soon as possible, and we won’t be able to go anywhere without our own mechs."
"Aye, sir, we’ll get on it right away!"
They didn’t hesitate at all this time. Mech technicians without working mechs were like fish out of water. Now that they finally got to taste some drops, they immediately focused on their tasks. They hadn’t forgotten the import of their duties.
Ves nodded in satisfaction. Even without a chief technician riding over their shoulders, they possessed enough sense not to slack off for too much. Still, as he paused and observed their work, he found out why these techs ended up in the Vandals instead of a more prestigious mech regiment.
Their ability didn’t quite measure up to the true professionals of the Mech Corps. The amount of care and attention they put to their own safety was worrisome, and some exhibited annoying habits such as banging their tools against the object they were trying to service if anything didn’t go too well.
"Stop trying to hit the mech with your multitool!"
"Uh, ahm, sorry, sir!"
A few minutes later, the same guy started hitting the mech with his tools again.
Problematic or not, Ves didn’t have anything else to work with, so he tolerated their eccentricities. Now that he got one mech to work, he was eager to unleash his hacking software to the other mechs in the stables.
After entering and exiting around twenty mechs in decent shape, he got around six of them online. Three of them consisted of bestial mechs while the other three consisted of humanoid rifleman mechs. It was a good mix of mechs, and should serve Captain Orfan well.
He contacted his superior through his comm. "I’ve got one mech ready to go, with five more mechs in the pipeline, ma’am. As for the remaining mechs of the Dastardly Handsome Bastards, it’s unlikely I’ll be able to get them up and running any time soon."
"I knew you wouldn’t disappoint me!" Captain Orfan grinned in a savage manner. "Good work, Mr. Larkinson. Six mechs are sufficient for now, as I don’t have a lot more mech pilots to spare. Ready them all for action as soon as possible. The main Vandal ground force is being stalled by much more resistance from Eneqqin’s household troops than we anticipated. It’s vitally important that we take over some of their duties from behind enemy lines."
Ves wondered whether their meager numbers would amount to anything, but he kept his doubts to himself. "I do have to mention that three of the mechs are bestial instead of humanoid. Will that present a problem?"
That caused Orfan to drop her grin a bit. The Flagrant Vandals uniformly utilized humanoid mechs.
The only exception might be the Akkara heavy cannoneer, but that was basically a really big and fat humanoid mech with four instead of two legs. It didn’t take too much effort for a normal mech pilot to adjust to its control schemes.
"I will be certain to warn my men." She said, though her tone belied the difficulties in store for her mech pilots. "Please prepare the training modules on the mechs in question. Perhaps they could benefit from a brief refresher course."
"Yes, ma’am. I’ll prepare the materials."
Orfan shut off the channel, leaving Ves with very few instructions. It didn’t take too long for Ves to put the bestial mechs in training mode. After that, he instructed the mech technicians to welcome the mech pilots and assist them into taking control of the hacked mechs.
Ves already turned his gaze to the other mechs that stubbornly remained locked. He knew that Captain Orfan’s detachment wouldn’t be able to accomplish anything of significance with six shabby mechs.
"More mech pilots will certainly trickle in during the day. There’s not enough time for the Vandals to complete their objectives. The more mechs I can bring online, the better our chances of completing our objectives."
And making it out of Vesian space alive.
Ves never put the software aspect of mechs in his eyes.
When he started out with developing variants, he always utilized the complete control system that came with the base model.
When he moved on to designing his own original mechs, he mostly pieced together the different software that came with with the component licenses. To get them to communicate and work together in a seamless fashion, he unified them into an off-the-shelf operation system that he randomly bought from the MTA.
The MTA developed these operating systems for maximum compatibility and minimal chances of bugs and errors. They’d been polished to such an insane degree that even the shabbiest heaps of junk on legs would be able to operate smoothly as long as its shambling components held up.
"A good operating system is like a very bright mind. The highest quality software can elevate the performance of the weakest mechs to a higher level."
With such a convenient solution at hand, Ves never spent much effort into improving his ability to program a mech, let alone hack its operating system. If Ves still possessed the System, his Status would clearly state that his Computer Science Skill still stood out with an abysmally low evaluation of Incompetent.
Normally, his approach to this field didn’t pose a problem to him. As much as a mech designer pretended to be all-knowing when it concerned their profession, he never intended to learn every possible aspect about designing mechs. Even if he possessed something as absurd as the System, Ves would have to spend too much DP to upgrade every possible Skill and Sub-Skill.
"I should have at least spent a few thousand DP to upgrade my Computer Science to Novice or Apprentice or something."
If he had done something like that, then he may be in a better position to hack the tough cases that remained in the mech stables.
In truth, hacking was an extremely complex field and profession in its own right. Mech designers generally worked on the other side of the fence and tried to make their mechs as impenetrable to virtual invasions as possible. They never put any importance in learning how to hack someone else’s mechs.
"If Captain Orfan has a full crew under her command, then she’d surely have a professional hacker under her command."
Hackers of all kind still thrived during the Age of Mechs. Much of their battles occurred out of sight, but their clashes sometimes reached apocalyptic proportions in virtual space. As poor as the 6th Flagrant Vandals might seem, they certainly wouldn’t have neglected their hackers and virtual security experts.
Ves turned on his comm and contacted Lieutenant Burke. A projection of the communications officer’s face appeared over his armored wrist.
"May I help you, Mr. Larkinson?"
"Does Captain Orfan have any hackers at her disposal?"
"No." The lieutenant shook her head. "I’m sorry, Mr. Larkinson, but we’ve been prioritizing the search for hackers even over other mech pilots. Our efforts have turned up fruitless so far."
The crew complement of a combat carrier didn’t include a lot of hackers. Chances were low that the few hackers aboard the destroyed vessels had ended up on Detemen IV. Even if their crash balls or hazard suits took them to the planet, they might have landed far away from Neron City.
Thus, they may never be able to retrieve their own hackers before their time in the system was up. Ves came up with a different solution to overcome this problem.
"Since chances are low that some of our hackers will return, I think we should enlist the services of local hackers instead."
The lieutenant frowned at that. "You want to rely on Vesian hackers to unlock those mech?"
"You’re in touch with the Detemen League, right? Surely they can spare some hackers for us."
"We’ve already asked for assistance, but to no avail. Every hacker in their employ is busy with scouring through databases and records in a concerted effort to find out where Lord Javier is hiding. It’s impossible for them to spare even a single hacker away from this crucial task."
That explained why the rebels hadn’t lent a hand. Still, Ves didn’t give up on his idea yet. "If we can’t borrow the services of a rebel hacker, then why not someone else? Millions of people live in Neron City. There should be thousands of people among them with hacking expertise. Just grab the closest ones you can find and force them to work for us."
"That’s madness!" The lieutenant blew up. "Although a skilled hacker might be able to unlock those mechs, they can also slip in any number of sabotage. Who can tell whether they’ll embed spying software that broadcasts the positions of our mechs to House Eneqqin’s troops? Hackers can do so much more than that."
She had a valid point, but Captain Orfan wouldn’t be able to accomplish any of her tasks if they didn’t do anything.
"If their loyalty is in question, then why not track down and kidnap their family members as well?" Ves suggested. "As long as you hold enough leverage over their heads, they’ll obediently do what we want."
He thought that a Vandal would accept his words without blinking. Instead, the lieutenant looked at him with horror.
"We do not condone such behavior! The Flagrant Vandals might not enjoy the best reputation, but we uphold the values of the Republic. We do not approve of such despicable behavior."
Ves wanted to smack the lieutenant’s face. What was she even saying? Their arrival into this system directly led to the misery on the streets. The Vandals already had a lot of blood in their hands, so what was the harm in dirtying them with a few more drops?
Just as Ves wanted to put out a retort, a third person intruded into their comm channel. "Lieutenant, back off."
"Captain Orfan!"
"Ma’am."
The lieutenant saluted at her superior while Ves nodded at her presence. He hadn’t realized that she listened in on their conversation.
"Let me preface this by saying that the Flagrant Vandals aren’t pirates and will never be anything like them." Orfan said, yet she looked apologetic at Lieutenant Burke. "However, our circumstances have landed us in a difficult place. We are far away from any friendly help. Both the rebels and the main ground force are preoccupied with their own priorities, and they have nothing to spare for us. We’re on our own here."
"That should be no excuse to loosen our standards!"
"We’ve never played by the rules!" Orfan overturned the naive-sounding lieutenant. "We’ve broken more rules than we can count simply to keep the Flagrant Vandals afloat. Perhaps your shipboard assignments hasn’t allowed you to get in touch with what we do, but I can tell you that Colonel Lowenfield herself wouldn’t reject Mr. Larkinson’s suggestion out of hand."
"B-B-But ma’am, we’re part of the Mech Corps."
Ves found Lieutenant Burke’s protestations very sad, in a way. Under normal circumstances, her opinion should have been the prevailing one. Yet such an idealistic attitude would have doomed the Flagrant Vandals many years ago.
Captain Orfan spoke correctly. The Vandals never played by the rules.
"The Mech Corps is fighting on the frontlines, holding the Mech Legion back on Republican soil. We on the other hand have snuck knee-deep into Vesian space. Our only allies are the tenuous Vesian rebels, who only agreed to cooperate with us because our interests happen to align on some matters. Without any other friends that can bail us out, we are basically at their whims."
"The rebels have made it more than clear that they want to drag Lord Javier from whatever hole he’s hiding and execute him in the most painful and public manner possible." Ves added, though perhaps he acted a little too presumptuously because Captain Orfan sent him a dirty look.
Orfan coughed a bit. "Our timetable is shot to hell. Nothing is going according to plan. During times like this, it’s necessary for us to be flexible."
Against her direct superior, Lieutenant Burke had no choice but to retreat. "I understand, ma’am."
"I’ll draft some orders for you to pass on in a moment. I want you to task our intelligence specialists in finding the probable locations of any notable hackers in Neron City. Make sure to find where there families might reside as well. We’ll task our mechs and infantry to retrieve these Vesians once we find their locations. Mr. Larkinson will have his hackers soon enough."
The three-way channel closed, leaving Ves by himself. Just as he thought he had the Vandals figured out, the conversation just then showed that his judgement wasn’t complete.
"Are the Vandals truly worthy to carry the banner of the Mech Corps?"
Perhaps they weren’t as monolithic as Ves had initially suspected. He always treated them like a single monoculture where every Vandal more or less held similar ideas. Ves hadn’t seen a dispute like the one between Captain Orfan and Lieutenant Burke even once since the months he had been with this mech regiment.
"Maybe it’s a difference between a mech officer and a ship officer."
Even if they served under the flag of the Flagrant Vandals, they all formed their own cliques. Though they shared a common starting point when it came to their culture, they all possessed their own nuances.
In general, the ship crews let themselves be subordinated to the mech crews. A mech regiment revolved around their mechs, not their ships. Many mech pilots even dismissed the importance of modern carriers as space taxis for their mechs.
In the middle of this traditional dynamic, only Colonel Lowenfield broke the mold. By all accounts, she wasn’t a mech pilot, yet she commanded the respect of all the Vandals, mech pilots or not. Even if her administrative skills had rescued the Vandals from the brink of bankruptcy, she must have mastered some secret sauce in order to win the hearts of every Vandal.
"Well, whatever. That’s not important right now."
While Captain Orfan prepared her unit to follow his suggested course of action, Ves needed to make his own preparations.
Though the rudimentary network setup by the Vandals didn’t allow him to connect to the galactic net, he still possessed his self-made comm.
Previously, in situations like this where his skills fell short, Ves would have spent his DP on upgrading whatever Skill was necessary to tackle the problem.
"I can’t do that for the time being, but maybe I can do something similar."
Ves entered one of the many abandoned offices of the Dastardly Handsome Bastards and closed the door. After making himself comfortable, he activated his self-made comm and visited the virtual portal of the Clifford Society. He wasted no time to enter their Star Library.
As a Knight of the Society, Ves was allowed to read any textbook in the lowest library of the Society for free, and with much less restrictions.
If he tried to borrow a quality book from the Moon Library, he had to wait until someone physically delivered a special means for him to read the highly protected books.
"It’s impossible for me to count on that in the middle of a war zone."
Fortunately, Ves didn’t think of upgrading one of his higher Skills. He only wanted to brush up his extremely low-level Computer Science Skill, and perhaps pick up some pointers about Hacking along the process.
"My current Intelligence is rated at around 2.1, which is far above the genetic limit of humanity. I wonder how fast I can learn the basics of Hacking?"
Ever since he upgraded his Intelligence through the Transcendence Pill, he never made full use of his strongest Attribute in a learning capacity. His ability to cram new knowledge should have reached a frightening level.
His virtual avatar looked at the endless rows of simulated books and grinned like a shark. He already began to salivate at the prospect of devouring the knowledge hidden within at a record pace.
The height of his current level of Intelligence had reached a ridiculous height. This was the first time Ves put his efforts into absorbing as much knowledge as possible, and his reading and comprehension speed astounded him. He browsed through the pages of his textbooks with such speed that he already flipped to the next page while he read the current one.
Before he ingested the Transcendence Pill, he was like a slow transport. After he took it, he turned into a blazing fast corvette.
"The difference is like night and day. There’s no comparison!"
The boost in Intelligence hadn’t made him any wiser, but it had certainly transformed his several cognitive functions that manifested fully when it came to learning new knowledge. His brains basically turned into an organic processor that could rapidly memorize, process and understand anything he came across.
Ves became increasingly proficient in Computer Science, to the point where he had long gone past the Incompetent tier.
That said no one would ever become proficient in hacking just by reading a few books. As much as Ves absorbed a university degree’s worth of knowledge, he hadn’t fully mastered what he learned.
"It’s like learning how to play an instrument by reading a book. As much as I’m familiar with the theories, I’m still missing some elements."
Ves did not set out to learn how to program and how to hack mechs on his own. He only wanted to gain a solid foothold into this field so he could somewhat understand what other hackers tried to pull off under his supervision.
"Besides, it’s not like this knowledge will go to waste. I can leverage what I’ve learned to all of my future work."
Still, as much as Ves saw the potential in mastering the software side of mechs, he felt absolutely no affinity for this field. The more he delved into this topic, the more he got the sense he was beginning to go astray.
This caused him to pause his learning for a bit. He struggled to understand why some part of his personality meshed so poorly with his latest area of interest.
"Is it... because it clashes with my values?"
He could find no other answer that made sense. Programming was barely tolerable to him, but the topic of hacking really sang a discordant tone to the rest of his mind. The more he immersed himself in the many ways in which he could manipulate a mech down to its very root, the deeper his unconscious repulsion for the idea.
"This is... not compatible with my design philosophy!"
It all came down to his core ideology concerning mechs. He long believed that mechs weren’t lifeless machines and shouldn’t be treated as disposable commodities. Every mech held the potential for life, and they should be treated more akin to individuals than pure products.
Ves might not have completely formed his design philosophy, but he definitely knew the direction it was heading in. All in all, he believed that even the shabbiest mechs deserved a basic measure of respect.
Yet despite his beliefs, he hadn’t truly fleshed out the nebulous concept of life. He always thought of it in an abstract fashion, which wasn’t wrong in itself, but only scratched the surface of what this contentious word really meant.
Some people believed that bots fell into the definition of life. Even the stupidest cleaning bots possessed some form of autonomy, and even if they couldn’t propagate by themselves, neither could many other organisms such as certain castes of ants or bees.
Yet even if a radicalist tried to argue that bots should be regarded as living beings and thus deserve the same rights as animals or humans, nobody would entertain such a whacky idea. Even the best AIs developed by experts that could pass most of the sentience tests eventually became stumped when it came to highly illogical subjects such as love, art, culture and faith.
Thus, society found it acceptable to treat bots and AIs as objects instead of actual life. Ves wouldn’t shed a tear if a malfunctioning AI needed some readjustment, because in the end they served as tools for humanity.
The same couldn’t be said for human beings. Through countless of examples throughout the Age of Conquest, humanity gained a deep abhorrence to any attempts at trying to program the human mind. Many forbidden technologies developed by heretical organizations such as the Five Scrolls Compact became masters in subverting the minds of anyone who fell into their grasp.
The vast majority of society deeply rejected these kinds of methods. Humanity had developed into one of the overlords of the galaxy, and through this growth their collective pride in their own being had grown.
"Every human is precious. No human life should be belittled."
This thought became the unofficial motto of the Age of Mechs. Heralded as a principal reaction to the massive amounts of destruction and sheer disregard for the value of human lives, the principle that life should be valued became one of the most accepted principles in human space.
Due to this universal thought, any incidences of brainwashing, slavery and excessive slaughter of humans received near-universal condemnation. Even the most tyrannical and poorly-run states tried their best not to cross these red lines, if only to deny their rivals a casus belli to justify a war against them as well as get the MTA and CFA off their backs.
"When you think about it, hacking a mech is sort of messing with their minds."
Even if it was limited to bypassing their locks to allow other mech pilots to use them, it still represented a violation of a mech’s personal sovereignty. This may be why he felt an unconscious repulsion for the entire concept of hacking mechs.
"It’s not a good idea for me to delve in this field any further. Not until I figure out how far I can go without compromising my design philosophy."
He didn’t feel too bummed out with this unexpected limitation. Besides the Polymath, no mech designer chose to master every field. Ves had already set his priorities on which fields he wanted to develop, and hacking simply didn’t fell into his list of priorities. He wasn’t any worse off than before.
Above all else, this realization aided his understanding of design philosophies. They were more than a set of opinions. They guided the principles mech designers set forth through their work.
The best way for Ves to describe it would be to call it the overarching vision of a mech designer. It worked on a higher level than the mech-specific visions Ves established at the start of every design project.
"I see now! I get it!"
From this understanding, Ves faintly sensed that a couple of gears had been turned in his mind. He couldn’t help but believe that he had taken one step closer to advancing towards a Journeyman Mech Designer.
Would he be able to reach that rank before the end of the war?
"Who am I kidding. I’m still years away from reaching that rank."
Ves spent the rest of his time trying to consolidate what he learned up until some of the Vandals returned to the base with hostages in hand.
"Mr. Larkinson! Your hackers are here!"
Ves immediately pulled himself out of the Clifford Society’s virtual portal and strolled out with his helmet floating behind him. He didn’t need to wear the helmet at the moment, but he didn’t think it was safe enough to shed his light combat armor. Most of the other Vandals still wore their hazard suits or some other pieces of armor they scrounged from the base.
Kneeling down with their hands over their heads, around two-dozen prisoners whimpered and remained cowed as couple of Vandal soldiers stood over them. All of them had their wrists tied together and more than half of them sported ugly bruises on their faces and bodies.
"Please, let us go!"
"Don’t kill us! We hate Lord Javier as well!"
"My child is sick! She needs her medicine!"
Ves frowned at the noise. Though a small part of him sympathised with the civilians, a greater part of his mind reminded himself that Captain Orfan’s group wouldn’t be able to do anything without making use of these prisoners.
"Take them away." Ves waved his hand away as if he pushed away some trash. "I’m sure this base has a holding cell or something."
The armored, gun-toting Vandals kicked and cajoled their prisoners away from the mech stables, saving Ves from their annoying pleas. He looked at the three Vesian prisoners that remained. The two men and one woman appeared to be in the upper commoner class. Though that didn’t make them nobles, they would have certainly enjoyed a lot of status on Detemen IV.
"Are these the Vesian hackers?"
"Yes, Mr. Larkinson. They are placed in your custody. You can do anything you want to them."
"Good." Ves smiled.
Things were picking up now. He looked at each of the three prisoners and saw that all of them looked to be in their thirties or thereabouts. Right now, their expressions looked awful. Each of them had seen how the ruthless Vandals captured their family members and treated them with rough hands. Fear and worry suffused their minds.
Ves nodded in satisfaction when he saw their fear. He took no pleasure in their suffering, but he wanted them worried enough that they wouldn’t think of pulling something off.
He stepped forward, letting his armored boots clank against the deck of the mech stables. This caught their attention.
"Welcome to the makeshift headquarters of Captain Orfan from the 6th Flagrant Vandals. It’s kind of a mess right now. It would be much cleaner here if we can get all of these mechs out. That’s where you come in. I need you to put your hacking expertise to use and unlock these mechs so that the Vandals can make full use of them. Refusal is not an option."
The three prisoners looked at Ves as if he was a devil. "W-W-Will you let my family go?"
"Sure." Ves whipped his hand dismissively. "We’ll have to keep you until the end of our deployment on Detemen IV, but yes, if you do what you are told, you can leave with your families after this is over."
Perhaps coming from him this might not have been much of a carrot, but the stick was big enough to force them into compliance anyway. The three hackers unanimously agreed to hack the mechs under his supervision.
"Ah, we don’t have our tools. Without our special computers, it’s going to be four times as hard to break into these mechs!"
"We don’t have enough time to retrieve your equipment. Make do with what you have." Ves answered instantly.
Ves had already prepared some computer terminals for them. He also made sure to disconnect them from every other network. He wasn’t too assured with disabling their connectivity from the operating system, so he took the extra step of opening up the gadgets and physically disabling the components that allowed it to connect with any networks.
The only way these terminals could interact with other machines was through hardline cables.
"We can’t work as well without our hacking software. I need to download my software suite from the galactic net."
"No!" Ves rejected in an even stronger this time. "We won’t risk you pulling something off on the galactic net. I know that mechs can still be hacked with a basic terminal, so don’t give me any excuses. You work with the tools we’ve given you and nothing more."
Though it certainly crippled the capabilities of these hackers, Ves and the Vandals simply couldn’t afford letting these Vesian hackers run out of control.
Thus, under gunpoint and under coercion, the kidnapped hackers proceeded to cobble up their own tools as they discussed how to hack the mechs. Ves stood quietly behind the three and listened on. While he couldn’t completely follow their thread of conversation, with the help of his newly acquired knowledge he understood enough to know if they did their jobs in earnest or tried to slip in something bad.
After two hours, the hackers unlocked their first mech.
The former abode of Javier’s Dastardly Handsome Bastards became much livelier once they subverted the locked mechs. Once the hackers got the hang of intruding into one particular mech, they applied the same solution to every other mech from the same model line, leading to a lot of time savings.
"Good work Mr. Larkinson!" Captain Orfan said as she came down to the mech stables to see the results for herself. "What is your progress so far?"
"I prioritized getting the remaining bestial mechs to work, knowing that your mech pilots need some time to adjust themselves to their control schemes. After that, I began to unlock the lightest mechs. They’re cheaper and their security suites aren’t as tight as those on the more powerful mechs. Right now, we’ve brought nine out of sixteen undamaged mechs out of their slumber. Sadly, the mechs after this will be tough nuts to crack, captain."
Ves kept his eyes glued to the panels projected in front of the three hackers. Not even once did he look away. He couldn’t afford to miss anything should they try to pull something off.
Captain Orfan looked on as some of the Vandal mech pilots that had answered her rallying call over the day enter the cockpits of their mechs. Soon, those mechs would be out on the streets.
"The Dastardly Handsome Bastards have left some damaged mechs behind from our fight to take over their base. Is it possible for you to bring those mechs in working condition as well?"
"I’ll see what I can do ma’am, but from the condition of those mechs, you really did a number on them. Proper repairs will take days."
"That’s out of the question. We’ll be departing from the surface in less than two days, perhaps even sooner. I need an extra mech up today!"
The pressure piled up on Ves, who winced from the unreasonable order. "I can’t make any promises, ma’am, but perhaps I can jury-rig a mech together in a hurry. It won’t perform up to standard, mind you."
"That’s okay. Right now, we need as much mechs on their feet as possible. Having even a partially functional mech at our disposal is a significant to us because we can leave it to guard this base while the combat capable mechs are free to roam the streets of Neron City."
He understood now. Captain Orfan didn’t want to bring a mech online to fight against other mechs. She merely wanted something that looked big and scary enough to deter any troublemakers from approaching this occupied base.
"Is it bad out there, ma’am?"
The Vandal captain released a tired breath. "It’s twice as bad as last night. Everyone is awake now, and at least a third of them can’t sit still in their homes. Some are joining the riots, others are fed up and are banding together to fight against them, while more have gone mad entirely."
With the Vandals visibly present in some portions of Neron City, the capital city became a complete madhouse. This otherwise prosperous and beautiful city became a focal point of death and suffering due to the unexpected arrival of the Vandals and the sheer incompetence of Lord Javier.
Any planetary administrator wouldn’t have led his people turn against themselves so suddenly. What happened out on the streets spoke much about Lord Javier’s ability to lead and inspire the citizens of Detemen IV.
"Leaving a half-operational mech as our only guard is kind of sketchy." Ves remarked. "I’m not questioning your judgement, ma’am, but who knows what the Vesians will do when they find out about our presence. Besides the police and House Eneqqin’s household troops, there’s also the gangs and mercenaries to contend with. They haven’t shown up with their mechs so far, but that might change in the future."
Captain Orfan crossed her arms and looked on with a resolute gaze. "If it’s a choice between putting more mechs out on the streets or keeping them holed up in our base, I would chose the former any day. We don’t have enough mechs and mech pilots to spare. Finding Lord Javier goes beyond our safety."
Ves hoped it didn’t come to that, but evidently the Vandals truly pushed themselves into a corner. He knew that any further arguments wouldn’t work.
"Very well ma’am, after these hackers finish with the intact mechs, I’ll work on getting a damaged mech up and running as soon as possible."
"That’s what I like to hear from you, Mr. Larkinson. If you will excuse me, I need to return to my office and plan my next moves with the main ground force."
"Ah, one more thing ma’am, how is the main battle going on?"
Orfan smirked. "We suffered a bit by losing those combat carriers, but the Vesians have truly pissed us off. Major Verle survived the destruction of the Stubby Growler, and he’s out for blood right now. We’ve initiated limited orbital bombardment on some of House Eneqqin’s strongholds near the manufacturing district. Once our boys up in orbit started to pound those positions, they’ve begun to fall apart."
They could both hear occasional explosions and other sounds of battle off in the distance. It reminded them both that a lot of Vandals fought hard to reach the same city that they already entered.
"Will we be able to control the city after the main force breaks through?"
"Not as such." Orfan shook her head. "As impressive as our numbers might be, this city is too big for a couple of hundred mechs to exert complete control. We can only concentrate our forces on a couple of districts if we want to maintain complete control."
"I see."
Captain Orfan departed the mech stables after they finished their discussion. Ves wondered if she would pilot one of the recovered mechs herself. He imagined that she would feel far more comfortable to be out on the streets rather than to remain in base.
As the three hackers started to get familiar with each other’s capabilities, their ability to intrude into the mechs improved. However, because the mechs that remained locked possessed tighter locks, those time savings became swept up in the many obstacles in their way.
It took a lot of struggle to get a couple more mechs back online. While Ves still supervised their work, he also diverted his attention to supervising the repair process of one of the damaged mechs. He opened a schematic of the least-damaged mech and figured out a couple of improvisations that would patch up the mech just enough to be able to walk around.
"What do we do with the knee joints?" A mech technician asked besides Ves. "When Captain Orfan’s troopers invaded this base, they did a real number on that knee joint. It’s a total loss and none of us are skilled enough to fabricate and install a replacement mechanism."
"A mech doesn’t need a functioning knee to move around." Ves stated. "It’s sufficient to fuse the lower leg with the upper leg. Don’t aim for perfect mobility. Just restore the limb so that the mech can put its weight on it without collapsing. Can you do that?"
A light lit up in the mech technician’s eyes. "I’ll get on that, sir!"
Ves introduced a couple more solutions in that vein to the technicians, all the while keeping his eyes on his repair schematic and the work panels of the three hackers.
An ordinary human wouldn’t have been able to perform so many actions at once. Even if someone received a couple of gene boosts, they would still be hard-pressed to divide their attention without slipping up.
Perhaps one of the Vesian hackers underestimated Ves and counted on that, because for a split second he uploaded a tiny script to the mech that the hackers worked on.
Ves hadn’t even noticed how this hacker composed this script under his nose, but he nonetheless caught the hacker uploading something completely unknown to the mech. This script could do anything from broadcasting the location of the mech to the Vesians to timing a forced shutdown in the middle of the battle!
Safe to say, whatever the script entailed, the hacker was definitely up to no good!
"Halt!" Ves called out. He winked out the projection of the repair project and pushed the mech technician aside. "Troops, pull the hackers back!"
The armored troops that stood guard over the Vesians immediately dragged them back by the scruff of their necks. They squealed and complained, but Ves was deaf to their pleas. His gaze landed on the Vesian to the left. The man looked at Ves with shaking eyes.
"You!" Ves pointed at the man. "You just uploaded a script to the mech. What is it?"
"I.. ah.. It’s nothing, I just wanted to test its second layer of verification by throwing a bunch of test data at it. There’s nothing more!"
"Oh?" Ves raised his eyebrows. "Don’t talk nonsense to me. I haven’t seen you program this script, and I doubt it showed up on your terminal out of the blue. Show me the script!"
Under the looming presence of Ves, the pathetic hacker shrank back. "It’s gone! It’s already set to delete itself in the event of failure!"
Ves stepped forward until he practically towered over the guy. The other two hackers to the side watched on with growing horror as their fellow captive became increasingly nervous.
Even they could see the guilt affecting their colleague.
"What have you done?"
"Nothing!"
"Wrong answer!" Ves yelled and slapped the man’s cheek bloody with his armored gauntlet. "Can you revert what you have just done?"
"No! I can’t!"
This time, Ves kicked out with his armored boot, causing the man to fling backwards and crack his ribs. Practically everyone in the mech stables gaped at his violent outburst.
No one said anything. Ves was in charge around here.
In truth, Ves didn’t know what to do. The script potentially compromised a mech that the Vandals hoped to use. At its current state, who knew what might go wrong with this machine. Without beating the answer out of this rebellious hacker, Ves wasn’t confident enough to release the mech in question to the Vandals.
"Trooper."
"Yes, Mr. Larkinson?"
"Take this waste of space to the cells. Tell the guards there to interrogate him on what he did. I’ll send a report with the details through my comm soon, so they’ll know what to ask. Make sure to tell them to hurry up because we don’t have much time left on this planet. Tell them to go to any lengths if necessary, decency be damned."
"On it, sir. I’ll convey your words to the cell guards."
For a moment, Ves thought about beating the answer out of the hacker himself, but he figured the Vandals possessed a lot more expertise in that area. If he tried to interrogate the man himself, they might never get an answer before their time on Detemen IV was up.
Ves also didn’t want to sully his combat armor with the Vesian’s blood.
As the trooper dragged the wheezing prisoner away, Ves turned to the two remaining hackers. Missing one of their number set back their hacking progress by a lot. He could ill afford another incident.
"As you’ve just seen, I know a thing or two about what you are doing. As I’ve said before, don’t pull anything off that isn’t directly related to opening up these machines. Now get back to work!"
"Y-Y-Yes sir!"
Ves didn’t ask to be part of the Flagrant Vandals. Neither did he wish to be ejected from a pulverized ship and crash-land on a hostile planet. He was willing to do almost anything anything to get away from this cesspool of a planet.
"How far am I willing to go?"
The spontaneous question disturbed him a bit, because he felt apprehensive at the thought of answering it. He suspected that the answer wouldn’t make him very glad.
The offending hacker never returned. Ves imagined that the interrogation hadn’t managed to cough up the answers they needed.
"Why did he sabotage us?"
The Vandals made sure to grab his family members as well, so the man staked not only his own life, but everyone else he cared about as well. From what Ves had seen from his brief encounter with the family, they didn’t appear to be a dysfunctional family either.
What brought a Vesian to risk damnation to everyone he cared about? Was it worth it to spite the Flagrant Vandals?
"I don’t understand."
Was the hacker a patriot? Did he truly hold so much loyalty to his state that he didn’t hesitate to risk everything he held dear?
"It’s so stupid."
Perhaps he shared some of the blame as well. Though he kept a fairly keen eye on their actions, to the hackers it appeared that Ves only barely paid attention to them with his multitasking. If they thought they could get away with something, then his own behavior only encouraged them to go through.
In the end, nobody won. The hacker and his family would surely suffer a miserable fate because they directly crossed the Vandals. Captain Orfan couldn’t afford to be lenient in this regard, not if they wanted to keep the two surviving hackers in line.
The Vandals also suffered a setback due to the uncertain condition of the mech in question. It happened to be a powerhouse of a knight mech, one of the few in the stables of the Dastardly Handsome Bastards that could endure a beating.
Every other mech of the former mercenary group served offensive of support roles, so they dearly needed a solid knight to protect their backline.
"Can this mech be recovered?"
Ves investigated it for a time, but quickly figured out that it possessed one of the most advanced security suites of the mechs in their possession. The knight mech must be one of the prestige mechs of the Bastards for it to be so stuffed with security measures.
"Damnit. That hacker must have bided his time until he began to work on this mech."
Captain Orfan and her band of shipwrecked Vandals already ran a threadbare operation in Neron City. The loss of a single mech severely impacted their chances to survive and complete their objectives. The amount of restraint they needed to adopt alone would set them back by as much as half.
Yet what could they do? Ves couldn’t trust the remaining two Vesian hackers in their grasp and neither did he possess the ability to reverse the afflicted mech’s condition.
In the end, Ves decided to punt the decision to the woman in charge. As soon as he contacted Captain Orfan through his comm, the woman looked back with a serious expression.
"I am already aware of what transpired. These Vesian slimes are willing to do everything they can to ingratiate themselves with the nobles. The hacker holed up in our holding cell must have thought to buy Lord Javier’s favor. Hmph! He won’t be receiving a good end, I can promise you that."
Ves brushed the fate of the hacker aside. He could care less about that worm right now. "That still leaves the question on what to do with the mech in question, ma’am. I’d hate to leave a knight mech unused, but in my professional judgement the risks of deploying it are substantial."
The script that the hacker had slipped in only contained a few lines of code, but they might have activated some traps embedded in the knight mech’s programming. It could be anything from shutting off the mech in the middle of a pitched battle to breaching the containment around the cockpit and dumping loads of waste heat inside.
Certain mech designers liked to employ such traps in their mechs and offer them to the market as security features.
With the amazing amount of power and value associated with mechs, theft was an unavoidable fact of life. The amount of potentates willing to make a living by stealing mechs instead of piloting them in battle was quite a lot, and over hundreds of years they became rather inventive in their methods.
Security suites kept pace as well of course. When Ves licenced a cockpit production license, it already came with an appropriate security suite. Since the cockpit models he selected for the Blackbeak and the Crystal Lord designs fell into the premium range, Ves had never heard of someone managing to steal them from their rightful owners.
Yet.
There would always be freaks and genius hacking teams that could accomplish the impossible. To deter these threats, mechs sometimes incorporated a couple of hidden self-sabotage measures that would spring their traps at the right time.
Ves himself never thought about using such inane methods because he didn’t care too much about in whose hands his mechs ended up with after his company sold them off for the first time.
The mech designer of the knight mech in front of him thought otherwise. This person must have been a rather vindictive fellow, because its multi-layered security was replete with traps and other obstacles. It took the two remaining hackers a lot of effort to get past the final locks.
"The risks of taking the knight mech along our deployments is too great." Orfan eventually decided. "Yet it’s a shame to keep it in the stables. Tell you what. I’ll allow it to be brought online, but assign the mech to guard this base. The damage it could do to our other mechs will be kept to a minimum."
That safeguarded the Vandal mechs deployed on the streets, but opened the door to other risks inside the base.
Ves did not know whether to feel comfortable with this solution, because the fallout of a compromised mech might spill out to the rest of the base. Still, it wasn’t as if they had any choice.
"Let’s do that then."
A mech pilot came to wake the dubious mech up. Nothing strange happened at the start, so the sabotage didn’t go into effect at once. Ves read the telemetry transmitted by the mech but couldn’t spot any anomalies either. In the end, he gave up trying to figure out the consequences and let the mech take up its guard duty.
"Alright, get back to work!" Ves yelled at the Vesian hackers. "There are still several more mechs to go!"
It took a long time to get the handful of remaining mechs to unlock. Night had fallen by the time the mech stables became empty. The only untouched mechs that remained consisted of a handful of damaged mechs that the Vandals had somehow taken out in the process of conquering this base.
They didn’t have enough time to bring them all online. Ves hounded the hackers past their exhaustion and forced them to unlock the one mech which the mech technicians labored to restore to limited functionality.
Its lame leg might not provide the damaged mech with a lot of mobility, but when it came to standing guard, its crippled limb didn’t pose much of a hindrance.
"This is all I can do for now."
Both the mech technicians and the hackers worked in a neverending shift. While Ves himself felt he could go on for a entire week, the others only possessed a limited physique. Pushing them on was out of the question.
"You can rest now."
The mech technicians sighed and dragged their weary bodies out of the mech stables. Troopers carried the prisoners back to their cells. Hardly anything of value remained in the empty mech stables.
Ves didn’t feel like sleeping now, so he stood on a lifter platform and ordered it to bring him up to the roof of the stables. He sat down on its surface and looked out towards Neron City’s skyline at night.
From the din over the city, he determined that most of the riots had petered out. Right now, this was the time when mechs came to the fore. With their advanced sensors, they encountered no hindrance when they fought during the night.
A staccato of explosions, collisions and collapsing structures constantly sounded out in the distance. Even if the Vandals managed to break House Eneqqin’s household troops, that still left plenty of opposition in the manufacturing district and the city proper.
The government may have fallen back, but the private sector still had some teeth left into them. It was a shame that they would never lift a finger to help each other out. Most of the fighting that he could hear from the distance must have come from the Vandals defeating each private sector outfit in a piecemeal fashion.
Again, this was another sign that Lord Javier fell short. A unifying leader should have been able to call up every mech in Neron City no matter who they owed their allegiance to and form them into dedicated defense units.
"That hasn’t happened, though."
Instead, Lord Javier went underground as soon as the Vandal fleet arrived in his star system. The noble descendant of a powerful count completely disgraced himself and never hesitated in throwing away a substantial amount of his defense force at slowing down the Vandals.
Many Vesian mech pilots lost their lives against the Vandals. All of them had been nurtured by House Eneqqin at at a significant cost. Loyalty couldn’t be bought at an instant. It could only be nurtured over time.
Losing these mechs and men certainly affected House Eneqqin’s overall strength. The disaster happening in the Detemen System already affected their prestige in many ways.
Obvious to all, Lord Javier failed to step up and showed the Vesia Kingdom what a noble was made of. He disgraced his House and his father who put him in charge.
Let alone the count, the Duchess of Imodris herself must feel awfully pissed at his actions.
"Still, chances are he’ll make it out alive."
Right or wrong, Lord Javier picked the option with the highest chance of survival for himself. Even if the rebels and the Vandals made a concerted effort in scouring the palace and its surroundings, Neron City was simply too big to find someone who wanted to hide.
Ves gazed out at the city and wondered what the Vandals would do. They only had one day left before they needed to depart the system.
"Even if the Vesians are a little tardy, reinforcements shouldn’t be too far away."
Ves heard a couple of sounds of fighting in the distance. Another conflict heated up, insuring that this would be a sleepless night for many.
As Ves considered whether to turn in for the night or do some extra work, he spotted something in the distance. A lof sound of something massive being launched brushed past his ears.
"Huh?"
Instinctively, he looked up, and saw some faint reflections arcing in the sky. It fell directly towards the base that used to be owned by the Dastardly Handsome Bastards.
His eyes widened as the explosive shell landed on one of the base’s administrative buildings.
BOOOM!
The nearby explosion rocked Ves off his butt and bounced him backwards on the roof. He didn’t care about his sorry state but tried to scramble up to his feet. He ran back towards the side and looked at the impact site in horror.
The office building hadn’t been built with defense in mind. Though it was resistant to incidental damage from mechs, it had never been built to withstand a direct artillery shell. Base turrets should have intercepted such attacks, but the Vandals already destroyed them when they took over the base.
Alarms rang out throughout the entire base, and much of the Vandals started to move.
"Incoming mechs!"
"Evacuate the remaining structures! Take the underground escape tunnels!"
Ves cursed as he spotted a second shell arcing down towards the base. This time, the explosive payload seemed to be aiming straight at the mech stables.
"I gotta go!" He hurried onto his floater platform and tried to urge the sluggish device to bring him away from the roof. He also grabbed his floating helmet and slammed it onto his head, just in time for the shell to land and explode against the roof of the mech stables.
This time, the blast almost engulfed Ves as he desperately rode his floater platform to safety. The fragile device instantly crumpled, leaving Ves to lose his only support in the air.
His armored body started to fall.
The awful thing about the long-ranged artillery bombardment was that the Vandals lacked the means to stop it. The two mechs that guarded the base might as well be decoration for their complete inability to stop the artillery bombardment or chase down the artillery mech responsible for targeting their base.
While the first shell pulverized the office building in an instant, at least not a lot of Vandals should have been working there at this time. After Ves brought the last mechs online, Captain Orfan and some other mech pilots entered their cockpits and marched into the streets of Neron City.
The mech stables also turned into an empty shell. Ves dismissed most of the mech technicians, so besides some stragglers, not a lot of people got hurt.
That didn’t reassure Ves very much though, because he stupidly took a break on the roof. Now, with the second shell detonating on the roof, his body fell in the air and dropped several stories down until his armored form crashed against the ground.
"AH!"
His light combat armor only offered a limited amount of protection to the fall. The suit played a very minimal in mitigating the impact, thereby causing Ves to take the brunt of damage.
"It hurts!"
Even as Ves cried out in pain, the damage wasn’t as bad as he expected. His extremely sturdy body hadn’t broken any bones as far as he was aware of. He just felt enormously bruised from the hard fall.
A third shell landed in the base, this time targeting the barracks. A couple of sleepy Vandals had woken up from the first two detonations and evacuated from the structure, but not everyone got away in time.
"Abandon everything and escape through the tunnels!" Lieutenant Burke broadcasted over everyone’s comm. "If we get seperated, rendez-vous at Point Theta if you can!"
Some of the Vandals ran around like headless chickens, but once everyone became reminded of the evacuation tunnels, they poured towards the underground entrance.
Nobody thought about defending their position. It held no more value now that they managed to bring all of the intact mechs stationed back online. The Vandals wouldn’t stick around long enough to use the base as a supply point anyway so no mech needed to return.
Simply put, the base had served its use and turned into deadweight. If Ves looked at it in a more cynical fashion, then he might even argue that Captain Orfan only cared about the mechs. Once she got her toys, she heartlessly cast off the support personnel with a token defense force.
"If Captain Orfan arranged more defenses, we wouldn’t have ended up in such a sorry state!" Ves muttered as he scrambled to his feet and hurried in the direction of the tunnels. His scuffed and bent combat armor creaked as he moved. "Who’s bombarding us anyway?!"
In general, only the larger private outfits or government forces employed artillery mechs, and only under a limited amount of circumstances. Resorting to explosive shells in a city came with lots of repercussions.
He also couldn’t figure out who would target the base. Was it the government, or a private sector outfit? Why did they target a base with very limited utility to the Vandals?
Ves found no answers to his question. In the end, too many things happened outside of his purview. He had no idea what Captain Orfan was up to and why she had been so insistent in putting as much mechs on the streets as possible.
He didn’t think about it anymore as he entered the protective embrace of the underground tunnels.
As far as tunnels went, the ones dug up by the Dastardly Handsome Bastards didn’t go that far underground. Instead, it connected to a network of tunnels shared by a number of neighboring facilities. This spread around the cost and allowed multiple organizations to make use of the same tunnels.
Of course, breaking into a facility from an underground entrance was wouldn’t be easy. The single point of entry allowed many facilities to erect a lot of defenses at their emergency exits, so no Vandal thought about breaking into them. Instead, they marched forth until they couldn’t go any further.
"Go up!"
They entered a sloping tunnel that slowly brought them back up to the surface. By the time the survivors poked their heads above the ground, they had reached a fair distance away from the ruined base.
Lieutenant Burke counted the survivors and pressed her lips. "Only twenty-three of us present here."
Perhaps some other Vandals evacuated through some other routes, but they would have ended up far away from her group.
Their abilities differed substantially as well. While they didn’t have any mech pilots on hand, around half of her group consisted of mech technicians. Others knew their way around with weapons, and they even got the two exo-skeleton suited soldiers with them, whose presence managed to reassure everyone.
"It doesn’t look good, men." The lieutenant said. "We ran with nothing but our clothes on our backs. Some of you are armed, but over half of us are empty-handed. We also lost our communication lines with Captain Orfan, the rebels and the main Vandal force. As far as I’m aware of, we are on our own."
Ves raised his hand. "Can’t we contact the Vandals through the galactic net?"
"Out of the question!" Burke sternly rebuked him. "Communicating through the networks of our enemy is sheer folly. Even if we bypass the access points around us and track down the location of a quantum entanglement node, we’ll still be exposing our communications because the other pair of the node is in the grasp of the Vesians. They’ll be able to read everything we say."
"What’s the plan, then?"
The lieutenant frowned even deeper. She scratched her chin as she fell into a somewhat indecisive state. Most of the Vandals present looked at her for hope. As the highest ranking officer in their midst, everyone relied on her to get them out of this fix.
"We should make our way to the main force of the Vandals. We’ll have to cross at least half the city to do that, so the first thing we need to do is to procure some vehicles."
"We need more arms as well! We shouldn’t rely on our tin cans to protect us in our stead."
"Good idea. We’ll raid a weapon stockpile along the way if we can, but our highest priority is to obtain secure vehicles."
That was easy to say, but most of the vehicles that should have been buzzing in the air of Neron City had disappeared. They’d need to break in somewhere to get their hands on some sturdy vehicles.
Not any aircar would do. Preferably, they could get a hold of something that could survive a couple of missile impacts.
Lieutenant Burke opened up a projection that depicted a map of Neron City. She pointed out their current location. "As you can see, we’re situated in a middle-class district with lots of small enterprises. I think we can grab what we want if we target some of the neighboring facilities."
Someone objected to the suggestion. Burke pointed at a tall and burly mech technician. "Lieutenant, don’t forget our assailants are still at large. They could be trying to track us down right now."
"I understand your position, but I won’t change my orders. We’re in no shape to leave this district and enter the downtown area on foot. It’s far too dangerous out there."
Lieutenant Burke studied the map and tried to find the nearest facility that could potentially supply them with their survival needs.
Ves looked on to the side and studied the same map. Different from his own map, Burke’s version contained the last-known locations of Captain Orfan’s mechs.
It turned out that they went straight downtown towards the palace district. They arrived there first in fact and clashed a bit with some of House Eneqqin’s mechs before they linked up with the rebels forces that occupied the recently-abandoned palace.
Ves would need to cross several kilometers over some of the most chaotic districts if he wanted to reach the palace. He would be better off if he took a detour and reached the manufacturing district where he could finally return to the protective embrace of the Vandals.
Sadly, Lieutenant Burke had other plans in mind. "The way I see it, Lord Javier shouldn’t have fled so far. Our invasion completely took him by surprise. If he’s hiding somewhere in Neron City, he shouldn’t have been able to reach the outer districts without tipping someone off. His likeliest hiding spot should be around the palace."
"Captain Orfan and much of the rebels are already searching there." Ves interjected. "Our presence there won’t contribute to the search. We’ll just be weighing down our own mechs."
Many of the mech technicians quietly nodded. They knew how dangerous it was for exposed human beings to survive around mechs as they fought. The potential for collateral damage was extremely high.
"Need I remind you, Mr. Larkinson, you are not in charge around here. Strictly speaking, you’re a researcher. You hold no rank over us, so stand back and let us worry about your safety."
If Ves wasn’t mistaken, Lieutenant Burke still held a bit of a grudge against him over the argument on kidnapping the hackers. It hadn’t reached the point of affecting her professionalism, but she firmly refused to listen to his suggestions.
"Fair enough, lieutenant." Ves shrugged, conceding the point. It might not be such a bad thing for her to be the leader, as he wasn’t quite a leader himself. Though Burke looked a little young for the job, she did her best to step up and enact her responsibilities as an officer of the Mech Corps.
"Our target is this facility here. It’s twenty minutes away on foot, and there shouldn’t be any dangerous elements along the way."
Lieutenant Burke increased the size of her projection, allowing everyone to see the facility in question.
"It’s an intercity aircar depot!"
"Exactly, and a small one at that. While most of its vehicles consist of fragile civilian aircars, the depot also stores several armored shuttles for when they need to transport VIPs or sensitive goods. This is exactly what we need to obtain right now."
"What about weapons, ma’am?"
"It’s unlikely the depot holds more than a couple of gun lockers. The company that operates this aircar depot never shoots back at its assailants."
If they tried to break into the aircar depot, their route wouldn’t take them anywhere close to a company that might maintain an armory of weapons.
A lot of the Vandals present looked disappointed. They felt naked without a gun in their hands. Though they were willing to entrust their safety to the two exo-skeleton soldiers, they still felt ill at ease.
This was reality though. Lieutenant Burke refused to take a detour to rob a weapons cache. Time was of the essence, and they couldn’t afford to linger in this district.
Burke looked at each of the men and women under her lead. "Don’t forget that we have one more day until our welcome is worn out. We have to do our best to find Lord Javier. Who knows if our presence may provide a breakthrough in narrowing down their whereabouts. Let’s go!"
They marched forth in a loose and spread formation. One of the exo-skeleton soldiers walked way ahead in order to scout the way for the main body. Other Vandals with soldiering experience hopped from cover to cover, trying to minimize their exposure.
An attack could come from any direction. The Vandals mostly feared the windows and rooftops to either side of the street. Though their sensors cleared these sites of threats, these devices could still be fooled.
Ves walked in the middle of their formation. As a helpless mech designer, the Vandals didn’t expect him to contribute to any firefights. Obviously they hadn’t found out about his Amastendira. As long as he didn’t need to pull out his weapon, Ves was fine with being mistaken as a toothless civilian.
"Halt!" The exo-skeleton soldier up ahead spoke through their channel. "Enemy ahead! One light mech patrolling in our direction!"
The sighting of the enemy mech unsettled the Vandals under Lieutenant Burke. The woman made a gesture that forced the men and women to cut the chatter.
"Type and markings?"
The exo-skeleton soldier reported back after a few seconds. "Cat-like bestial mech, no ranged hardpoints. It’s coated in astral blue and silver with a prominent emblem of House Eneqqin."
A couple of Vandals quietly cursed while Lieutenant Burke started to frown.
"Strange. House Eneqqin should be directing all of their mechs to stop the main force. Why did one of their mechs stray to this part of town?"
Ves widened his eyes. "There’s a high possibility that it’s a scout mech! Be careful, its sensors are powerful enough to detect an exoskeleton suit from a distance!"
A loud, primal growl suddenly thundered over their heads!
"It detected my presence!"
"RUN! That’s an order!"
The thunderous steps of the four-legged mech echoed throughout the streets as the beast in metal skin rapidly surged towards the hapless exoskeleton soldier.
Ves heard distance weapons fire being discharged. The heavy rifles wielded by these soldiers possessed enough punch to chew apart a small vehicle, but against a mech, it must have been nothing more than a pinprick.
He could guess the outcome of the clash before its conclusion. With a distant crunch, the weapons fire ceased and the mech let out another artificial roar.
The Vandals hadn’t been standing still all this while. Under the lieutenant’s urging, they ran towards the nearest tunnel entrance that she marked out beforehand.
In the meantime, the mech started moving again. The echoes of its steps rang louder and louder.
"It’s heading straight for us!"
"How did it know how to find us?!"
"Johnson! Is your anti-observation gear still working!?"
"It’s still working fine! There’s no microbugs in the vicinity!"
"Don’t forget that this is House Eneqqin’s home turf! They must have embedded bugs resistant to anti-observation fields into the streets."
The theory was sound, but Ves started to doubt that conclusion. In any modern city in this age, the authorities littered the public spaces with all manner of sensors and observation gear.
However, the quality of these sensors only extended to how much their owners were willing to invest in them. In the galactic rim, most authorities only utilized the most basic and affordable sensors. They were cheap and easy to maintain, but came at the cost of being very easy to manipulate.
Anyone with means would be able to get their hands on software or devices that could hack, block, interfere, disable or even outright destroy these sensors. That was why crime and shady dealings still proliferated in the Komodo Star Sector. The ability to circumvent observation was too ubiquitous.
Naturally, not every method of observation could be stopped so easily. Enough investment allowed them to be resilient enough to withstand the most conventional means of blocking them out.
However, even if that was the case, the Vandals didn’t use run-of-the-mill countermeasures. One of the Vandals in a hazard suit carried a big anti-observation backpack module. It didn’t quite provide them with total stealth, but it somehow disabled several of the most common means of observation in the vicinity.
It actually worked quite similar to the Privacy Shield in his old comm, but it was a lot bigger and cruder.
With such a device in their midst, chances should have been low that House Eneqqin detected them, but somehow that wasn’t true. Were these streets so important that the authorities installed much more effective means of observations, or had the Vandals slipped up somehow?
Ves thought back on how the former base of the Dastardly Handsome Bastards suffered from an artillery bombardment out of the blue. The kind of mechs that can lob those kinds of heavy explosive shells shouldn’t have been very common. House Eneqqin absolutely couldn’t afford to divert one of them from the battle with the main Vandal ground force.
Yet they did so anyway against all common sense. Even if the Vandal ground force eventually managed to break through the defense lines, the absence of a single artillery mech must have exacerbated House Eneqqin’s defeat.
So why did they not only divert an important mech, but also managed to accurately bombard their key positions?
The Vandals had taken all kinds of precautions. They cleaned out and chased away all the occupants in the neighboring blocks. They employed powerful blockers that made it difficult for anyone to spot anything unusual about the base. If House Eneqqin wasn’t specifically keeping an eye on that base, then they shouldn’t have known about their presence.
Even as Ves could almost feel the mech bounding closer towards him and the fleeing Vandals, his mind finally made a possible connection.
His self-made comm!
Ves currently carried two comms. One of them was his military-issued one, which still couldn’t do a lot of things, but at least it possessed an extremely high degree of security.
The same couldn’t be said for his other comm, which he crafted to grant him access to the galactic net and to facilitate in hacking simple devices. As much as the black market designs for this series of comms claimed that they wouldn’t leave a trace, how much could Ves believe in them? Certainly not very much, especially since he reproduced one of the cheaper designs.
He hadn’t done much with the comm since he made it. His unexpected arrival at Captain Orfan’s temporary hideout changed his entire planning. Instead of using his comm to hack into locked aircars and hijacking them to bring him closer to the manufacturing district, he used it to hack into some of the mechs and enter the virtual portal of the Clifford Society.
Ves briefly hung on the latter. Who on this planet would connect with the network of the Clifford Society all of a sudden while Detemen IV was burning? No average mech designer would resort to such an action. Any Vesian who kept track of the comings and goings of the galactic net would immediately investigate the unusual connection.
Dread ran through his body as Ves almost faltered in his flight. One important question dominated his mind.
"Is it my fault that House Eneqqin bombarded the base?"
The possibility existed that Ves had directly led the Vandals to their doorstep and offered them a prime opportunity to massacre a lot of Vandals at once. The enemy might even be tracking their position right now through his unsecure comm!
"I got to get rid of it!"
Ves faintly slowed down in his flight so that he fell behind the formation. He fumbled with his suit while he ran, eventually managing to open up a narrow slot that allowed him to remove his second comm from his wrist. He looked at it with a mixture of guilt and regret.
"I don’t know if it’s my fault, but you’ve got to go! Sorry!"
He crushed the comm with his armored gauntlet and scattered the pieces behind him. Almost the instant he did that, the thundering steps approaching them from behind started to slow down for a few seconds.
Then the chasing mech bounded faster as if it wanted to catch the last glimpse of whatever it pursued.
Ves had his answer. His heart sank to the bottom at the realization that his negligence had indirectly led to the deaths of tens of Vandals. Even though he sometimes questioned their loyalty and commitment to the Republic, most didn’t seem all that bad. Their circumstances just dealt them a bad hand in life.
"Damnit. I can’t feel sorry for myself!"
Guilty or not, the milk was already spilled. He first needed to save his life before he had the luxury to repent!
The mech that chased after them might have lost a direct trace, but scout mechs came with a lot of other means of tracking. Ves knew that its capabilities would easily allow it to track the footsteps of more than a dozen people.
Lieutenant Burke tried to lead them through narrow alleyways and cramped streets, but the scout mech always seemed to find the right detours.
"How far to the tunnels?!"
"A few hundred meters ahead! We’re almost there!"
Just as they crossed an unavoidably wide street, the scout mech finally came around a corner and sighted the fleeing Vandals.
"It’s approaching us!"
From what Ves gathered so far, the cat mech didn’t possess any ranged weapons. That was hardly a consolation for them though because its powerful legs closed the distance at a very rapid tempo.
"We can’t outrun it! Fight!"
The Vandals shot at the mech with their pistols and rifles, but none of them dealt any noticeable damage to its exterior armor. Compared to infantry, mechs fell into an entirely different category. None of their weapons possessed any chance of leaving more than a dent on the Vesian mech’s armor.
"It’s coming close!"
"I don’t want to die!"
"For the Republic!"
At the precipice of death, the Vandals partially collapsed. Some fled in random directions while others kept firing their useless infantry guns at the nigh-impervious mech. Others looked to Lieutenant Burke for leadership, only to see that she had knelt down with her hands above her head in surrender.
"Stop shooting! Put down your arms and surrender! There’s still a chance we can live through this!"
This caused half of the gunners to drop their weapons and follow suit. Unfortunately, some of their other comrades wanted to fight to the end or didn’t believe the Vesian mech would show mercy. They didn’t have any obligation to accept their surrender in the first place.
"Put down your guns! That’s an order!" Burke yelled at the stubborn Vandals.
"If I go down on Vesian soil, I want to go down fighting!"
While the mech sprinted closer and closer with its violent steps shaking everyone’s foots, Ves stood paralyzed with indecision. Out of all of the Vandals, perhaps only he possessed the means to repel the bloodthirsty mech.
His gauntlet already flexed in a grip that would allow it to grip the Amastendira should he chose to materialize it out of his Inventory. If he dialed it up to maximum power and aimed with care, he should be able to take out a leg or two from the dangerously closing mech.
While no common infantry weapon could make any dent in its armor, the Amastendira had been built for this. The light mech’s armor shouldn’t be able to withstand a full-powered laser beam from his powerful weapon.
Yet Ves still hesitated pulling it out. The Amastendira was his trump card and he dearly hated bringing it out. Using it upon landing was already a reckless enough action, and he didn’t wish to expose it any further.
What if the Flagrant Vandals wanted to confiscate his precious weapon after the battle? Despite their many differences from a regular mech regiment of the Mech Corps, they completely inherited the control freak tendencies of their parent company. They would never allow a mech designer like Ves to hold onto such a dangerous weapon.
"I can’t expose it. Not here."
Still, was this the right time to hold something back? The mech almost reached close enough to stomp the Vandals with its paws and chew apart anyone into pieces with its jaws.
"Mr. Larkinson!" Lieutenant Burke suddenly shouted at him. "Tell us where its weak points are, now!"
Her request momentarily broke Ves out of his fog. Even though his attention preoccupied itself with the decision on whether to reveal the Amastendira, his eyes never left the bestial mech.
"It’s a fairly well-made felinid mech, but its armor is too light. Target its lower limbs joints if you can!"
"Did you hear that?! Target its limb joints!"
For a moment, Ves expected the surviving exo-skeleton soldier to pop out and fire his heavy gun at the joints. It wouldn’t work, as his heavy rifle still needed minutes to chew through the thin cover of armor around the joints.
Instead, something much more devastating fired from the side. A small volley of ballistic projectiles fired out. Some of them successfully hit the legs but only dented the armor. A second volley burst out, and this time the cat mech failed to safeguard its limbs. The mech suddenly collapsed after losing two of its limbs at once.
Subsequent volleys chewed apart the damaged mech to the point its mech pilot ejected away from the fallen mech.
A strange silence spread out as the Vandals regained their senses.
"We’re alive?"
Ves turned to the side to see what had shot it apart. Who or what had rescued them at the last moment?
A ballistic rifleman mech emerged from the side. Ves didn’t recognize its exact model, but it proudly sported a coating of burgundy and black.
"Friendlies!" Someone cried in relief. "We’re saved!"
Lieutenant Burke quickly ordered them to regroup and line up. They wanted to meet the Vandal mechs with a semblance of honor.
They all complied. Those who fled sheepishly returned while those who dropped their weapons quietly picked them up. Everyone pretty much selectively forgot their disgraceful actions a moment ago. They lined up in rows as several mechs emerged from a narrow side street.
The squad of mechs that emerged turned out to have been detached from the main ground force. The Flagrant Vandals had managed to send some elements in their direction, just in time to bail them out.
Ves looked at Lieutenant Burke, who appeared to be communicating with the commanding officer of the squad through a private channel. Hopefully they would bring them away from this place and take them back to their ships where they would immediately depart for orbit.
Sadly, the Vandals had other ideas in mind. Once the lieutenant finished her talk, she turned to the motley group of survivors.
"We are not going back just yet. Command wants us to head to a nearby stronghold of the Detemen League and assist them in combing the city for Lord Javier’s trace."
None of them seemed happy with the decision, but they had no choice but to follow orders. As much as they wanted to get away from this planet, as long as Lord Javier was at large, they still hadn’t completed their main objective for this daring assault.
Some time later, Ves ended up in a small armored transport as it made its way towards the rebel position. A pair of mechs escorted their transport, so none of them worried about getting shot. This allowed the exhausted Vandals to let down their guard and rest.
"Close thing, huh? I truly thought I would enter oblivion at that moment." A warrant officer spoke. "This is why I hate being bound by land. I can’t wait to get back in space."
Ves turned to the seat to his left and looked at the man who spoke. "Are you a spacer?"
"Aye. I had a nice time aboard the Rising Apple. I started off at life support before moving on to cargo handling. That lasted long enough before they busted me with skimming off the luxury foodstuffs meant for officers." The warrant officer chuckled.
"What happened to you after that?" Ves asked.
"They put me in charge of organic recycling! Basically, I became the ship’s plumber! It was the worst job of my life! In a way, I’m glad the missiles hit the Rising Apple, because at least I’m out of my job now!"
Ves couldn’t help but laugh along with the ship-based Vandal. "I see. So how is surface life treating you?"
"Ugh, don’t get me started with the air. The temperature fluctuates like a drunken weasel and the pollutants floating around makes me want to wear a filtration mask. I don’t understand how you landbound people deal with an environment that flips whenever it wants."
"Well, you can say the same about me. I don’t understand how you spaceborn folk stay sane by spending countless years in fragile boxes in space. So many things can go wrong, and the more you travel through space, the more something bad will eventually strike your ship."
The warrant officer shrugged. "That’s the beauty of it. Ships are artificial creations. We built them from our own efforts and understand exactly how they work. As long as you treat them right, they’ll never go wrong on you."
"That sounds the same as how mech pilots regard their mechs." Ves nodded. He found it intriguing to hear such a sentiment from a spacborn. Perhaps that was how they stayed sane in space.
The armored transport slowed down and shifted onto solid ground.
"Looks like we’ve reached our destination!"
Once the hatch opened up, the bedragged Vandals emerged in an underground compound of sorts. The cavernous hall looked as if something crudely dug into the soil and reinforced the walls in a hurry. Mechs, vehicles, supplies and weapons all mixed in the same space as the rebels hadn’t bothered to dig any other chambers in this hidden hole.
"Follow me." Burke said as she took charge again. Apparently, she received some instructions beforehand. "Make sure to keep your weapons stowed. The rebels are on our side, but don’t forget that they are Vesians at heart. They don’t look kindly to Brighters."
That quickly became evident as they moved through makeshift corridors. Piles of crates stacked up on either side of them as they squeezed through narrow openings one by one. The level of disorganization in this underground hall really irked Ves. The LMC would never stack up their goods in such a haphazard fashion.
After a few minutes of navigating the chaotic area, they reached some sort data center with many rows of terminals available for use. Several members of the Detemen League sat in front of the terminals, working on something with serious expressions.
A man in rebel uniform greeted Lieutenant Burke. "You must be the shipwrecked! Welcome to one of our cells. It’s not pretty here, but it’s safe."
"I appreciate your help. We could truly use a break, but I understand you have something in store for us."
The rebel leader nodded. "Our hunt for Lord Javier is closing in on his position. We’ve ruled out the vicinity of his palace as his most probably hiding spot. Our most up-to-date guess of his current location places him a few districts away from where we found you."
"Lord Javier is close?" Burke frowned. "How come he’s here? There is nothing of note in this part of Neron City."
"That’s the beauty of it. We know most of his hiding spots, because some of my fellow rebels helped build the underground bunkers. As far as Lord Javier is concerned, there can never be too few bunkers. So the first thing we did when we launched this operation was to crack open those eggs."
Obviously, they didn’t find the elusive noble.
"He could still be hiding somewhere downtown. It’s too big for us to comb through." Burke said.
"We thought of that as well, and sent most of our assets there. We found nothing except some decoys and a lot of useless Eneqqin loyalists fighting for a lost cause and an unworthy leader."
"Then what has made you think that Lord Javier can be found all the way here?"
"We caught his butler." The rebel leader grinned. "He’s not a disposable employee like the rest. The butler knows a lot about Lord Javier, but we immediately focused on getting the location of where he hid."
The subsequent interrogation led to the rebels diverting their attention to this specific area. It was well out of downtown and the palace, and was situated far away from the manufacturing district. It had nothing going for it except for a lot of boring offices interspersed with medium-sized apartment buildings.
By all accounts, this area was one of the most boring parts of Neron City.
"From what we got out of the butler, Lord Javier is enamoured by the idea of hiding here, because he thinks he’s outsmarting us by hiding in such an unremarkable location."
The argument sounded very compelling. From everything Ves knew about Lord Javier, he agreed that someone like him would think that way.
"What are our duties?"
"There are a number of tasks that need to be done if we want to comb through the neighboring streets. It needs to be done fast and it also needs to be thorough. We’ve got men out on the streets and the assistance of your unit’s mechs, but that’s hardly enough to sweep the entire area. That’s where you come in. I’ll explain each of the tasks."
The rebel outlined a number of areas where they could assist their efforts. One of them entailed supervising and performing maintenance on their vehicles. Another task involved sitting behind a terminal while sorting through any suspicious footage they pulled from the sensor bugs they released on the streets.
Nothing had to do with mechs. The Detemen League didn’t work with mechs at all, so Ves found it to be a shame that he wouldn’t be able to tinker with mechs.
After listing out the options, the rebel clapped his hands. "We can only sustain our search for nine more hours. Beyond that, we need to pack up our assets and make it out of the city before Vesian reinforcements catches up on our tail.
Nine hours?! That was a lot faster than Ves had thought. Everyone else looked at each other with a puzzled expression. Nobody believed that Lord Javier could be found within such a short timespan. The spoiled brat had done a good job staying out of reach.
"If our guess is correct and Lord Javier is hiding somewhere close, then you shouldn’t worry about the nine-hour time limit. As long as you work diligently, we’ll be ruling out more and more areas where he could be hiding until we finally stumble upon his location!"
Everyone quickly split up according to their expertise. Some expressed interest in performing maintenance on their vehicles, while others wanted nothing more than to sit back behind a terminal and do something that resembled their own duties aboard their former ships.
As for Ves, the rebels singled him out for some reason. "You must be Mr. Larkinson."
"I am. And you are..?" Ves asked a hard-eyed rebel woman that slinked from a narrow corridor.
"You can call me Addy. Come with me."
Addy led him through a number of other narrow corridors until they reached some stairs. Ves climbed up on it until they stepped foot on a ramp that looked down on the chaos of the underground hall.
Ves took in the sights as he kept pace with Addy. Though on ground level the interior looked chaotic, up here he thought he spotted a couple of methods to the madness. Perhaps the rebels hadn’t stacked their goods without any thought. The layout looked a lot more profound than he expected.
That didn’t matter much, though, because the open space above easily allowed a flying soldier to take in all the sights.
After climbing up another flight of stairs, they reached a enclosed room which Addy needed time to unlock. Once the armored hatch opened up, Ves and Addy entered into some kind of conference room.
"Take a seat, Mr. Larkinson."
An old man sat at the head of the table. Though they shared no resemblance, Ves thought the man radiated the same vibes as his formidable grandfather.
"May I know who you are and why I am here?" Ves asked. Apprehension grew at him when he was taken far away from the rest. What did the rebels want from a mech designer like him?
"I am Commander Breskin. I am in charge of this cell."
Breskin must be a big shot of the Detemen League, then. Ves sat up a little straighter in his chair. "I am honored."
"Now, please hold your patience, because the reason for your presence here requires some explanation. I can tell you now, though, is that your assistance may lead us straight to Lord Javier."
Ves became stunned at the bold declaration. The best and brightest of the Detemen League and the Flagrant Vandals had tried for days to track down that elusive fox. To hear from the commander that Ves of all people could deliver a breakthrough in the search sounded preposterous.
In truth, he wanted to ask if they needed to be looked at in their heads.
"I’m a mech designer. I make a living by working with mechs. I don’t search for fugitives." He spoke simply, as if he tried to explain why things fell down to the ground to a little child.
The commander nodded his head over and over and over again. "That’s exactly what we need!"
"Commander, he’s confused." Addy sighed, and turned to Ves. "To be more exact, we are not expecting you to track down Lord Javier. Instead, we want you to track down his personalized mech."
Ves experienced too many crises since the Flagrant Vandals arrived in the Detemen System.
Taking part in a monumental operation, escaping from a disintegrating ship and dropping onto Detemen IV with nothing but a crash pad wracked his nerves.
Roaming the streets of Neron City by himself, threatening a pathetic Novice Mech Designer to use his equipment, getting picked up by Captain Orfan only to flee again under Lieutenant Burke really set him off.
What was he doing here?
He wanted nothing more than to go back to orbit, but the Vandals and the rebels had other ideas in store. Ves looked at Commander Breskin with a weary gaze. Even though his body could keep him awake for days at a time, his mental exhaustion almost pushed him to the breaking point.
He needed time to think and decompress. He needed to reflect on his mistakes and figure out a better approach to problems.
Yet the rebel commander stayed firm. "Nine hours. No more. We have until then to track down our elusive goal."
His words made it clear that he brooked no compromise on this matter. Breskin didn’t even stick around. After exchanging some words with Addy, he left the conference room, leaving Ves alone with the young rebel woman.
"This sounds crazy." Ves wearily said as clapped his hand on his beaten combat armor. The fall dented it really badly, causing him to feel a bit uncomfortable as the plates pressed into him. "How am I supposed to pinpoint the location of a single mech out of potentially thousands in the city? I’m not a bloodhound, for heaven’s sake!"
Addy retrieved a data pad from her rebel uniform jacket and pressed it onto the table before sliding it up to Ves. "Please read the brief before concluding it can’t be done."
Ves picked up the pad and turned it on. He read the brief inside and started to become engrossed.
"What?"
House Eneqqin was a very significant force in the Imodris Duchy. It enjoyed a storied history as well, and the House encompassed many branch families. Lord Javier may be the only son of Count Loqer, who was the head of the House, but in the background countless nephews schemed against him. Once Loqer died or retired, it wasn’t a given that Javier would come into power.
"Count Loqer is an exceptional noble within the court of the Duchess of Imodris, and has even served as her chief of staff for one time." Addy explained. "He has single-handedly elevated House Eneqqin to its current heights. Many argue that he might be the most powerful count in the Duchy at this time."
"How come his son is such a craven bastard?"
Addy sighed and bent her head. "I don’t know. The high nobility is not something commoners like us can understand. For some reason, Count Loqer doesn’t have any natural offspring besides Lord Javier, and he dotes upon his only child to an excessive degree."
"Is the count infertile? Even if that’s so, there are many ways to get another heir."
"You obviously don’t understand Vesian succession laws." She said with a rueful smile. "Think about it. If a noble resorts to cloning or other artificial means of generating offspring, what stops their rivals from doing the same? An old trick is to steal a DNA sample from someone, splice an offspring and secretly raise the child to be loyal to your cause. When the time was right, the secret offspring would contend with the legitimate heirs to inherit the title of their parents."
That did make some sense. These days, many people didn’t bother with pregnancy and bringing a child to term inside the belly of a mother. As long as someone paid a sufficient amount of money, they could effortlessly offload the gestation and birthing process to an artificial womb.
Though many humans took this technology for granted, many others feared the use of artificial wombs would harm their children. The topic was very divisive, but it had nothing to do with Ves so he never looked into it until now.
"Even if Count Loqer is... less than fertile, how come he hasn’t fixed that yet?"
"The matter isn’t so simple." Addy said while shaking her head. "There are ways to remedy his infertility, but they are all rather extreme to the point where they run up to the limits of the succession laws. Will a child birthed from the ’new’ him still be his own child, or someone else’s?"
All of this started to make his head spin so Ves just accepted the argument and moved on. "Alright, let’s say that Lord Javier won’t be getting little brothers and sisters anytime soon. What does that have to do with tracking down his mech?"
"Well, as I said earlier, Count Loqer spoils his son rotten. Javier can pretty much do what he wants. No matter how much of a mess he makes, his father will always come and wipe his butt. However, there is one area in Javier’s upbringing where the count is extremely strict in. Can you make a guess?"
Ves only needed a second to come up with an answer. "His mech pilot training. Every noble in the Vesia Kingdom is either a mech pilot or a descendant of a mech pilot who performed meritorious services. Strength is power in this state, and there’s nothing worse than an heir that doesn’t know how to pilot mechs."
"Exactly! You can say what you will about Lord Javier, but he is a fairly impressive mech pilot, if only because of his strict tutoring and exacting physical training regime. We believe the pressure he’s enduring from his constant training has led to much of the excesses that he has become known. It’s his way of venting his frustration."
To Count Loqer and Lord Javier, acting like a complete bastard to their own people was worth it if the heir continued to make a lot of progress in his training.
The people of Detemen IV saw it very differently, however. With the rising amount of abuses and the deteriorating economy, Lord has long taken the place of the planet’s bogeyman. No one wanted to live under a frivolous tyrant.
"What’s the worst things he has done?"
His question caused Addy to grow grim. "We don’t know. He hides as much of his activities as he can. One of the worst cases that we know of is that he once detained every woman from Neron City’s corps de ballet. Our city’s ballet dancers are our pride and joy, and are famed throughout the Imodris Duchy for their sublime performance arts. After Lord Javier got his hands on them, they were never seen again."
Ves didn’t need to hear more. Just this story alone was enough to understand Lord Javier’s complete lack of regard for the territory and people he ruled over. If he ever inherited the title of Count from his father, he would ruin a lot more planets than Detemen IV.
"Okay, so Lord Javier is a depraved sack of dung. That’s great to hear, but what about his mech? What does he pilot?"
"Count Loqer commissioned a Senior Mech Designer by the name of Constantine Reeve. Have you ever heard of this designer?"
"I’m not familiar with Vesian mech designers. Their mech market is fairly isolated from ours. We don’t sell our mechs to them, and they don’t sell their mechs to us. Only a couple of traders try to bypass the trading restrictions by taking an indirect trading route, but by and large it doesn’t pay off."
"Well Constantine Reeve is a big name in the Vesia Kingdom. He’s known for his excellent rifleman mechs and swordsman mechs, but he also designs personalised mechs for nobles who can pay for his services. For Lord Javier, Reeve has designed a fantastic hero mech for the brat."
This caused ves to rub his eyes. "Say again? Did you just mention a hero mech?"
"I did not misspeak. Lord Javier’s main combat mech is a hero mech. It’s his most cherished acquisition and there is never a day where he isn’t practicing with it. The intelligence we gathered on the mech is on the data pad as well."
Ves browsed to the relevant documents while he thought about the fact that Lord Javier piloted one of the most controversial mech types in the industry.
The so-called hero mech was nothing but a fancy marketing term of a specific type of humanoid mech. They almost always came in a medium weight class, and wielded two main weapons instead of one. One arm always wielded a light rifle while the other arm held a one-handed melee weapon such as a sword or an axe.
The idea behind the hero mech was to provide talented mech pilots who were skilled in both melee combat and ranged combat with the means to do both at the same time.
Before the emergence of hero mechs, some other hybrid mechs had been developed to employ both a ranged weapon and a melee weapon, but only one at a time. While the concept sounded simple to a layman, only a mech designer knew how difficult it was to insure a strong performance with both modes of combat.
The hero mech was supposed to reduce that complexity by devoting one arm to melee combat and the other arm for ranged combat. This inherently introduced an imbalance in the mech, but through several means mech designers were able to compensate for this. What resulted was a silly looking mech that formed the favorite of many action dramas throughout the galaxy.
"Okay, tell me this. Did Lord Javier choose to pilot a hero mech because it looks cool, or because he’s good at it?"
"With someone like him, it’s both." Addy answered. "He started off without any training, but under the guidance of his instructors, he has become very deadly with his Loquacious Raphael."
"What a mouthful of a name. Did he try to tribute his father when he named his mech?"
Addy shrugged. "The Raphael is a very fearsome mech nonetheless. Any work of Constantine Reeve is a masterpiece, and that goes double for his custom mechs."
Hero mechs were notoriously hard to pilot. Duel wielding was already an issue, but wielding a full-sized rifle and melee weapon at the same time put a lot of mental strain on any mech pilot. Ves had to readjust his judgement of Lord Javier.
If he managed to master the Loquacious Raphael, then it would be a given for him to inherit the title of count from his father despite his many faults. Nobody wanted to mess with a mech pilot who could fight one against ten in the right circumstances.
One of the many reasons why hero mechs starred so often in action dramas was because they became known as mechs that could win against overwhelming odds. In practice, most mech pilots weren’t good enough to exhibit the potential of their hero mechs, but Lord Javier might be the real deal here if Ves put stock in the intelligence reports compiled by the rebels.
As Ves read more and more about the Loquacious Raphael, he understood why the rebels believed he could track down this mech.
Journeymen and Senior Mech Designers employed many advanced techniques in their designs that lower-ranked designers couldn’t hope to emulate. The effect was similar but different from resonance in that it didn’t take an expert pilot to draw out the potential of a resonating material.
The former was called fake resonance, while the latter referred to true resonance.
True or fake, both types of resonances generated a lot of energy. A mech that resonated radiated special signals depending on the strength of the resonance.
For example, Ves once witnessed Venerable Drake in his Fire Worm striker mech charging up a laser rifle or his flamethrowers with resonance. Such a huge buildup of energy could easily be detected from hundreds of thousands of kilometers away.
That was a case of true resonance at its apex. The story would be very different in this case.
"It can’t be done." Ves concluded. "Fake resonance is a hundred times harder to detect than true resonance. Besides, is Lord Javier stupid enough to pilot his Loquacious Raphael in the first place?"
"Oh, you’d be surprised, Mr. Larkinson."
Some time later, Ves sat behind a terminal in the data center. More than two-dozen other rebels or Vandals performed their own tasks behind their own terminals in the partially enclosed space.
The hunt for Lord Javier continued. The rebels needed everyone they could spare to follow up on suspicious footage and anomalous signals. They had accumulated a vast amount of observation data, but possessed too few means to process them all in a timely fashion.
Thus, the need for Lieutenant Burke and some of her more computer-adept Vandals to check through mounds of data, just to obtain a tiny clue about the noble’s whereabouts.
The manhunt for Lord Javier certainly took a toll on everyone. Forget about the Flagrant Vandals, the Detemen League which staked their all in taking down the man was nowhere close to pinning his location.
Addy explained the dire necessity of capturing Lord Javier to Ves at the end of the briefing. "Our rebellion is fighting against the Vesian way of governance. Many fellow rebel groups based throughout the Kingdom is paying attention to what is happening here. We’ve loudly proclaimed that we intend to take Lord Javier down. To that end, we’ve taken advantage of a so-called pirate attack and we are even working in concert with Brighters such as you. After so many sacrifices, failure will finish the Detemen League."
In other words, the Detemen League wanted to redeem the deaths and chaos that ensued in these chaotic days by taking down their most hated tyrant. As long as Lord Javier died in their hands, the public would willingly if grudgingly accept the enormous damage done to their planet.
Of course, Ves did not quite think that such a trade was worthwhile. Having roamed the streets of Neron City in person, the devastation was much more extensive and ruinous than the rebels initially thought.
Still, no matter how much the citizens suffered, the Detemen League were already riding the back of a tiger. They couldn’t get off at this point without being savaged.
"This entire operation is stupid. Too much hinges on hope and desperation."
What irked Ves the most was that the Flagrant Vandals made overly rosy projections. Every single step of the plan was met with delays or setbacks. The original timetable for this operation no longer applied, and Ves got the feeling that most of the Vandals did whatever they thought was best right now.
Ves truly wanted to applaud Lord Javier for being such a decisive coward. Loathsome he may be, merely by going into hiding, he ruined most of the plans by the rebels and the Vandals. As long as Lord Javier remained out of reach, he would be able to destroy the foundations of both the Detemen League and the Flagrant Vandals.
Compared to letting half his planet burn, the little bastard probably thought the price would be worth the suffering.
Who was Ves kidding. Only the citizens suffered while Lord Javier leaned back and drank champagne or something.
"He needs to be taken down a notch."
What Lord Javier did in his own territory didn’t matter too much to Ves. He sympathised with the righteousness of the rebel cause, but as a Brighter he preferred it if the Kingdom was plunged into turmoil. Perhaps if every Vesian planet rioted, then the Mech Legion wouldn’t be pounding so aggressively on the Bright Republic’s gates.
"Well, let’s get back to my job. How will I be able to find the Loquacious Raphael?"
The rebels gathered a decent amount of surface intelligence on the Raphael. While they hadn’t been able to get their hands on the juiciest files such as its design schematics or its spec sheet, they did get their hands on Constantine Reeve’s maintenance instructions.
A highly advanced mech was a lot harder to maintain than a run-of-the-mill mech. Replacement parts consisted of difficult to work with alloys and needed to be reproduced to an exact degree in order to repair an advanced mech.
From the maintenance instructions that Reeve provided to Lord Javier, only the lesser components of the Raphael should be reproduced at home. For the more sophisticated components such as the power reactor and engine, Lord Javier had to request a replacement from Reeve’s mech company.
"That’s a shame."
From what Ves determined from the intelligence on the Loquacious Raphael, much of its fake resonance revolved around its powerful energy reactor. Without any schematics, descriptions or images of the hero mech’s reactor, Ves had nothing to base his starting point on. He needed to fill the gaps with his imagination in order to progress.
"Okay, since the energy reactor is a black box, what about its lesser components?"
Ves quickly turned his attention to the arms. The asymmetrical arms incorporated a lot of sophisticated systems depending on what weapons they wielded. However, their propensity for damage and manageable complexity led Mr. Reeve to delegate the maintenance and repair to House Eneqqin’s mech technicians. The arms didn’t need to be reproduced in the most advanced fabrication environment. Just a normal premium production line would do.
The arms played an important role for the Loquacious Raphael. The effects of the fake resonance needed to be channeled from the power reactor in the torso to the weapons held in the hands. This demanded special channels to be run through from the base of the arms to the tips of the fingers.
The only problem was that Ves didn’t immediately spot these so-called channels. He looked at the maintenance schematics of the sword arm and rifle arm but couldn’t spot any obvious section which served as resonance channels.
It was like staring at a bundle of identical ropes. How could he determine the one that behaved differently from the norm when he had never seen them in action?
"These files are woefully incomplete."
It quickly became clear to him that the rebels hadn’t managed to snag the complete set of maintenance documents. They only nabbed the most relevant documents to maintain the Loquacious Raphael on a day-to-day basis. Ves didn’t have access to the documents related to the more substantial repairs.
"Is it even possible for me to make any progress at this point?"
Ves hit a wall about two hours into his investigation. He chased after several leads, but every potential resonance channel turned out to serve a different purpose.
"How does Constantine Reeve manage to pull off such a ridiculous mech?"
A lot of mech designers looked at hero mechs with skepticism. Ves inherited this standpoint from his teachers who believed the best mechs consisted of specialised mechs. Any machine that tried to perform multiple roles at once inevitably needed to compromise on its design.
Having worked on hybrid knights such as the Caesar Augustus, Marc Antony and Hellcat designs, Ves knew that was true. A mech that tried to do two or three things at once would never be able to deliver the same amount of performance as a mech that only tried to utilize one weapon well.
Still, his hands-on experience also taught him not to discount the concept of hybrid mechs. The way the Flagrant Vandals used the Hellcats certainly opened his eyes to their potential value. The mech regiment hadn’t picked the Hellcats as their prestige mechs for nothing.
"Hybrid mechs have a superhuman quality to them. Even if their performance is supposed to mediocre on paper, with the right pilot they are able to pull off a lot more feats than if they only adhered to a single role."
It sounded like a paradox, but really wasn’t. The key to appreciation hybrid knights lay in their ability to synergize with itself.
More weapons provided the mechs with more tools. They could tackle more problems on their own because they always had the right tool for the job. Even if the tools turned out to be a little shabby, that was better than having no tool at all.
The Vandals employed Hellcats as shock units, meant to overwhelm enemy formations through a short succession of highly kinetic attacks. From the missiles, to the nail drivers, to the charge and shield impact, every sequence involved putting the enemy at their back foot.
The strategy worked particularly well in space because mechs didn’t have any footing in the first place. They relied on their flight systems to maintain their positions, and they could easily be overwhelmed if subjected to too much force.
In this way, the Vandals made brilliant use out of a mech that strangers would ordinarily dismiss as trash.
"Every mech possesses an underlying logic. The Loquacious Raphael shouldn’t be any different."
In the absence of further data, Ves figured he needed to approach the problem from a different direction. He tried to put himself in Mr. Reeve’s shoes and imagine the fighting style of the Raphael.
Hero mechs different exhibited many different variations. Some put the emphasis on sniping. They wielded a powerful semi-automatic ballistic rifle that fired powerful kinetic projectiles that took down their opponents from a long to medium range.
For battles up close, they tended to wield a spear or other long-handled weapon in order to fend off an approaching mech until the hero mech could point its powerful rifle at the offending mech.
Other hero mechs tried to be light on their feet and swift in their movements. They wielded short swords or knives in one hand that allowed them to be as deadly as skirmishers, but they wielded pistols or submachine guns in the other hand to pose a threat to aerial mechs and other distant threats.
The Loquacious Raphael happened to adopt one of the most standard hero mech loadouts, and the one most often featured in unrealistic action dramas. It wielded a rapid-fire ballistic rifle in one hand and a bog-standard sword in the other hand.
Every mech pilot trained with these two weapons from the start. It didn’t take much of an adjustment for any mech pilot to get used to wielding both weapons at once.
The challenge lay in achieving enough synergies so that the mech pilot outperformed a rifleman mech or a swordsman mech by a wide enough margin.
Still, did hero mechs outperform standard mechs because they held more potential, or because mech pilots believed they would deliver a better performance with these machines?
"Are hero mechs only popular because they’re piloted by the heroes in action dramas?"
It was an interesting question, but one which Ves would never be able to figure out on his own. The question had a chicken and egg type of quality to it. No matter the original merits of a hero mech, it was undeniable that their proliferation in the galactic media made them into mechs that were larger-than-life.
Perhaps that was what drew Lord Javier to a hero mech type in the first place. He wanted to become the hero of his own story, and distinguish himself from all the other mech pilots that settled for normal mechs.
Part of the reason why so few people piloted hero mechs was that it demanded at least thrice as much training as normal mechs.
Mech pilots needed to keep up their swordsmanship and marksmanship in equal measure. Then they needed to devote another round of training into mixing them together in a cohesive whole.
"It can’t be done by an average mech pilots. Even my family never pays attention to it, and we’re practically a military dynasty."
Only an extraordinary heir such as Lord Javier possessed the right conditions to make a hero mech work. If he possessed the resources, persistence and talent to not make a fool out of himself, then perhaps he was one of the few mech pilots who wouldn’t be disgracing himself with a hero mech.
Ves looked back at the image of the Loquacious Raphael. Coated in House Eneqqin’s astral blue and silver, the mech made for an extremely valiant sight. However, as much as its rifle looked shiny and lethal, Ves faintly felt as if it emphasised its sword a little more.
"Perhaps herein lies the clue."
"There’s something strange about the Loquacious Raphael."
Ves looked past its ungainly name and its unusual loadout. Instead, he began to dip his perspective into Mr. Reeve’s design philosophy.
He quickly found out that this was an exceedingly dangerous move. Higher-ranked mech designers constantly warned those who haven’t formed their own design philosophies that they shouldn’t take too much inspiration from the works of their betters.
The older generation trod their own path. Following in their footsteps risked turning younger mech designers into pale imitations of their teachers.
Though he started to speculate over incomplete data, what the Detemen League managed to gather so far painted a broad enough picture of the Raphael’s intended use.
"Just like other hybrid mechs, the Raphael is built to impress."
While vanity definitely played a major role, the mech’s entire design was suffused with the intention of making an impact on allies and enemies alike.
Basically, the Loquacious Raphael weaponized its showmanship. Every aspect of it was designed first and foremost to show off.
Practicality took something of a back seat in terms of priority, but that didn’t mean that Mr. Reeve neglected it entirely. Instead, Mr. Reeve successfully exaggerated the appearance and abilities of his mech without detrimentally affecting his design too much. Ves felt as if his entire design philosophy seemed to build up to a perfect fusion of awe and efficiency.
Ves initially didn’t know what to make of such a silly standpoint. Ordinary teaching in the field of mech design treated it as a solemn profession. Mechs should be devoid of flashy gizmo’s and attention-grabbing cosmetics.
Yet did those classes truly represent the will of the people? His own products all incorporated a little showmanship themselves, what with the incorporation of the completely impractical but very cool Festive Cloud Generator in his design.
"Yeah. I’m guilty of this as well."
Mr. Reeve simply took this guilty pleasure as his core competency and developed it towards an extreme. Ves didn’t even need to look at his design catalog to know that his mechs must be highly desired props in action dramas.
Still, while the Raphael looked good in a projection, it made an even better impression in the flesh. One of Reeve’s tricks was to finetune the sounds his mechs released when they moved. Each motion carried its own sound, and each of those sounds had been selected for maximum psychological impact.
A person standing near or in the cockpit of a nearby mech would feel the threat of the Raphael in their bones.
Its ballistic rifle formed another point of showmanship. While its frame looked rather large and intimidating, it was fairly hollow underneath its surface. The rifle unleashed rapid-fire shells or projecticles that could overwhelm any mech in close to medium range due to their fairly huge caliber.
As anyone with a brain could imagine, this capability came at a cost. Intense recoil caused the rifle to swing wildly out of control, and the magazine would quickly run out of projectiles after a quick succession of shots. Still, as a tool for intimidation, the weapon worked splendidly in this capacity.
"The rifle is meant for intimidation. It’s the sword that kills."
The Loquacious Raphael’s sword took on a golden sheen. Its shape resembled the straight sword of a knight, which gave the weapon a heroic impression. Outside of that, the weapon looked fairly simple, but that did not take away from its deadliness. The excellent materials and incredible sharpness of the sword allowed it to puncture through heavy armor in the right circumstances.
In a way, Reeve compromised the least on the sword, giving the Raphael at least one reliable means of taking out its opponents.
That lack of compromise and emphasis on genuine performance reflected back in the sword arm. It incorporated a bit less frivolity compared to the arm meant to wield the rifle.
"Reeve still hasn’t brought his design philosophy to the apex."
The time when Constantine Reeve successfully married showmanship with practicality whereby improving one would pull up the latter would be the moment when he advanced to the rank of Masters. Every Master became known of making the impossible into the possible.
From a professional standpoint as a mech designer, Ves certainly looked forward whether Reeve could succeed.
"Still, mech designer or not, I’m also a citizen of the Bright Republic. Since we’re on opposite sides, don’t blame me for taking apart your work."
Ves faced an important question at this point. Did Mr. Reeve employ the fake resonance to augment the Raphael’s sword arm or rifle arm?
"It could be both, but I doubt it. Resonating two completely divergent effects is too much."
Even if Reeve made it his life mission to turn the impossible into reality, some goals were harder to obtain than others. Ves figured that the Senior Mech Designer chose to surrender on this matter.
That left Ves with a guess on which aspect of the mech the resonance was supposed to enhance.
From a practical perspective, strengthening the arm and sword allowed the Raphael to be a powerhouse up close. The mech already possessed plenty of intimidation factor in its rifle, but adding an extra kick to its sword attacks turned it into a fearsome killing machine in close quarters combat.
However, Ves also came up with an argument against augmenting the sword attacks. "The sword arm is already good enough. It doesn’t need to be any stronger."
Channeling resonance in the ballistic rifle allowed the Raphael to shoot exotic projectiles that expressed itself in strange ways upon impact. The effects varied wildly depending on the exotics used in the formation of the projectiles.
Some burned hot on impact, while others freezed the impact site. Some caused the projectiles weigh twice as heavy, others caused them to partially phase through any obstacle, thereby dealing significant internal damage.
The challenge facing Ves was that he didn’t know how the Raphael expressed its fake resonance. It might not even be focused on an offensive form, though Ves figured that was unlikely.
A mech designed to show off wouldn’t focus its resonance towards defense of auxiliary functions.
"Resonating the sword allows the Raphael to become even deadlier in battle, while resonating the rifle enables the mech makes it a lot more flashier."
When Ves framed the question in this way, the answer seemed obvious. Reeve always chose to take the flashier options. While he did not have any hard proof of his assertions, Ves strongly felt that his deduction agreed with the design philosophy he perceived from the Raphael.
Ves nuzzled his head with his palm as he finished this extensive train of thought. Diving into another mech designer’s design philosophy was never easy, though his mind quickly recovered from the strain.
"Is my Spirituality helping me cope with the dangers of studying someone else’s design philosophy?"
His highly developed mental and spiritual capabilities protected him from the dangers of diving too deep into matters that Apprentice Mech Designers shouldn’t be dealing with in this stage of their careers. Ves had never thought too much about it, but perhaps this was an advantage that he largely overlooked until now.
Ideas formed into his mind, but he quickly pushed them away. "Now is not the time to exploit this possibility. I still have a job to do."
A lot of thoughts ran through his mind as he looked at the files on the Loquacious Raphael. He focused on the rifle arm in particular and studied each and every facet the rebels had gathered on the limb.
"There’s no obvious resonance channel, so it must probably work through other components."
Plenty of reinforced channels and cables ran from the base of the arm to the tip. The power was necessary to fuel the functioning of the components embedded along the way as well as interface with the rifle via touch.
"There should be something there. These composites and alloys look suspicious."
Ves looked up the the materials on the galactic net and found out that all of them enabled low-level resonance transmissions. While they looked to be fairly weak, the arm in fact incorporated a lot of this kind of material.
Could the answer be there in plain sight?
"Practically the entire arm is a resonance channel!"
The use of so many different substances must have led to a lot of inefficiencies that weakened the final result. Nevertheless, Reeve sacrificed little to accomplish this brand of resonance, thereby avoiding making any further compromises that caused the mech’s performance to deteriorate.
"So let me see. If so many different materials are resonating at the same time, there’s bound to be a substantial amount of interference. Perhaps... this can be tracked!"
Every resonance-capable exotic released a different signal. Material scientists speculated that the waves released by resonating exotics was a form of inefficiency. If a resonating material channeled all of its energies into a targeted reaction, then the process shouldn’t release any superfluous signals.
To Ves, the Raphael’s rifle arm pretty much reached the height in complexity in terms of channeling resonance. With many components pulling double duty, all of them evoked different frequencies of waves that meshed together like different music instruments in a song.
"Even if I know what instruments are used, the songs that they are able to play are practically endless."
Different forms of resonance affected exotics in different ways. Still, it was not as if the materials that Reeve incorporated in the arm possessed an unlimited amount of variation. The amount of ’songs’ it could play was ultimately limited.
Ves finally knew what to do now in order to track the Raphael. He turned to his terminal and opened up a simulation program. He found a standard mathematical model that tested the resonance signals of many different kinds of materials.
Once Ves set the parameters to his liking, he initiated the simulation process and let it go to work. Ves looked at the progress bar of the simulation and knew that it would take a while for the processors to churn out the results.
He leaned back in his chair and looked around. Rows and rows of other people occupied the terminals in this section of the rebel base. Everyone worked diligently in order to track down Lord Javier with their own methods.
Would his investigation bear fruit or lead to nothing? It would be unimaginably frustrating for him to start from scratch if his theory turned out to be wrong.
After half an hour, the simulations finished. "Huh. That was fast. The rebels must have access to a lot of processing power."
In any case, the output came in the form of over twenty different resonance profiles. Using the previous analogy, the resonance profiles represented different songs.
Ves frowned a bit when he saw how weak and muddy these resonance profiles looked like. It wasn’t easy trying to pick up these profiles from the mass of noise that suffused a major city every day.
After double-checking his process and results, Ves felt that he had done the best he could and wouldn’t be able to deliver a stronger result. Therefore, he raised his hand and called over Addy.
"Mr. Larkinson, there is only about six hours left for us to apprehend Lord Javier. Have you made any headway into tracking down his mech?"
"I accomplished quite a lot. I may even have the means to pin down his mech’s location as long as it’s been activated recently."
Ves briefly explained the resonance profiles he came up with. As a layperson, Addy didn’t know half the stuff that Ves referred to, and he already dumbed down his explanation by quite a bit.
Fortunately, due to the proliferation of action dramas, the concept of resonance wasn’t completely unfamiliar to the public. They just possessed exaggerated misconceptions about their effects.
Addy’s eyes glowed as soon as she got it. "This is brilliant! From what we know of Lord Javier, he will definitely choose to seek refuge in his mech for safety. If Javier has activated his mech, we can track down its movements and location as long as we try to find out if any of these profiles are picked up by the sensors we’ve scattered around the city."
This would be like seeking a musician from the sounds he produced as he moved around.
The only complication here was that the Raphael wouldn’t be engaging its resonance while on the move. The actual signals would be extremely hard to detect if the Raphael kept its resonance at a dormant state.
"So I wouldn’t get my hopes up, Addy." Ves finished explaining.
The woman practically ignored his caveat. All she could see was the silver bullet presented by him to her lap. "Don’t worry Ves, this will definitely work, I can feel it!"
Since their time came closer and closer to running out, Addy didn’t waste any time in bringing the potential solution to Commander Breskin.
It didn’t take long for the commander to change his orders. Breskin issued a new set of orders that forced over half of the analysts to abandon their current investigations and begin to tackle a new one based on detecting one of many different resonance profiles.
The workload seemed daunting. With only a score of people, it would be impossible for them to manually match every signal gathered by millions of sensors scattered over Neron City with the twenty-plus resonance profiles.
The Detemen League sprinkled a lot of different sensors over the city in preparation for this operation. Once it begun, the sensors came online and gathered an enormous amount of raw observation data. It was frankly too much to work with, so the rebels mostly stored them in their databanks to be used selectively when they needed it most.
This was one of those times. They subjected almost four days worth of raw data to a signal matching program that rapidly tried to detect signals similar to the resonance profiles.
The computational load from all of this work put a huge strain on the rebel base’s processors. While the rebels gathered a substantial amount of processing power, that simply emphasized how monumental their newest search had become.
"How long will this take?" Addy frowned as she stood next to Ves.
"Could be hours. Could be days." Ves replied. "It depends on how soon we find a match. We’re currently searching from the first day of the operation when Lord Javier presumably fled with his Raphael. If there was any a time to activate his mech, that would be the moment to look for. It shouldn’t take too long to obtain a definite answer."
While others fretted and tried to contribute their own efforts into searching for a match, Ves really didn’t have anything else to do. The processors did all the grunt work, and the only thing the analysts needed to do was to make a judgement on every edge case the simulations presented to them. They rejected quite a bit of false leads this way.
Not everyone believed this investigation would bear fruit. A Vandal who sat a few seats away from Ves snorted contemptuously.
"That Javier fellow put all of his attention on evacuating from the palace. By all accounts, he fled before the rebels moved their forces to that location, so the noble never needed to fight."
"What’s your point?" Ves asked.
"His mech never pulled out all the stops. There’s no reason for us to be searching for signals that have never been transmitted!"
Ves smirked in response. "You’re wrong in that. You’re right in that the Loquacious Raphael is hard to detect if Lord Javier kept a low profile, but both the mech pilot and his mech are attention seekers. Do you really believe that Lord Javier ran his mech at the lowest settings possible?"
The man couldn’t answer that because he never analyzed Lord Javier and the Loquacious Raphael like Ves had done.
Hero mechs always made a scene wherever they went. Their ability to intimidate and inspire awe was baked into their feature set.
In the vast spectrum of mech types, hero mechs pretty much sat in the opposite dimension of stealth mechs and assassin mechs. The former sought to make a statement, while the latter sought to come and go without a whisper.
Certainly, if Lord Javier possessed some common sense, then he might have done his utmost to suppress every possible signal emanating from his mech. It was what a professional would do.
A spoiled brat on the other hand... even if Javier was a mech prodigy, some habits died hard.
Ves therefore faced the skeptic with confidence. "I’ve studied the Loquacious Raphael in detail. Did you know that when put under a small level of resonance, the rifle arm will begin to glow like a rainbow? It’s meant to distinguish the mech and force others to pay attention to it. I would bet all of my wealth on the chance that he activated this effect by default."
Resonance couldn’t be sustained forever. Besides exacting a mental toll on the mech pilot, it also wore out the resonating exotics. The level of deterioration was directly proportional to the energy level of the resonance.
As fake resonance was weaker than true resonance, the Loquacious Raphael shouldn’t be under too much strain. For a rich man like Lord Javier, the added cost of maintenance shouldn’t even register on his mind.
Thus, Ves remained confident even if others believed nothing could come out of this search.
Ves did not relax for long though. While he initially planned to take it easy and rest, he suddenly slapped himself out of his complacency. "This is the final day of the operation. As long as Lord Javier isn’t in our hands, we can still botch this up."
He needed to be more proactive and prepare for every eventuality.
Thus, Ves prepared for the event that the Loquacious Raphael would be detected. What would happen next?
"The rebels and the Vandals will send as much of their forces as they can to apprehend him. If it’s true that he’s hiding in the neighboring districts, then not a lot of mechs will arrive in time."
The major deficiency of the Detemen League was that they mostly consisted of lower-class commoners. Some of the rebel cadre came from slightly more privileged backgrounds like Commander Breskin, but most of their combat personnel belonged to the underclass.
Still, Ves found it strange that the local rebels hadn’t managed to retain a single mech pilot. He turned to Addy. "Hey, can I ask you something? Why doesn’t your group have any mechs?"
"Mech pilots have no reason to join forces with us." Addy replied simply. "House Eneqqin’s administration may appear incompetent, but when it comes to nurturing mech pilots, they are surprisingly diligent about it. Potentates are wooed from their tenth birthday, and constantly receive many benefits as they go through the academies. Once they become mech pilots, the best of them will join House Eneqqin while the worst of them will still believe that they are the best."
"You haven’t found any exception?"
"There may be a handful of disgruntled mech pilots on Detemen IV that we could potentially recruit, but it isn’t worth the effort. We’ll have to expend a lot of resources and manpower to maintain a separate mech force."
"It doesn’t take too much of both to run a mech force. That’s one of the selling points of mechs." Ves pointed out. "Many mercenary corps are able to run their operations on a shoestring budget. Why shouldn’t the Detemen League be able to do so as well?"
Addy sighed. "There are many other reasons. For example, the Vesia Kingdom classifies the rebel groups that are fighting against it according to their military strength. On a list, a dozen auxiliary regiments worth of assets simply isn’t threatening enough compared to a single fully-equipped mech regiment."
"In other words, you can have enough strength in the form of infantry, tanks and aircraft to overrun this planet, but it won’t look as alarming as a handful of mechs?"
"Exactly!"
"That’s stupid." Ves stated. Even though he was a mech designer who absolutely loved mechs, he also knew what they were capable of. Mechs became the main mode of combat in human space due to their versatility and ease of transport and supply.
That didn’t mean their strength overwhelmed older unit types. Combined arms still remained the most effective form of deployment in wars, especially because states were only able to field so many mechs before they ran out of mech pilots.
"Do you really think it’s stupid?" Addy blinked. "Mechs are threatening in the hands of rebels like us because they’re fast, easy to deploy, and easy to hide. What do you think will happen to the auxiliary regiments we’ve taken over at the start of this operation?"
Ves never thought about their fate. The auxiliary regiments that used to answer to House Eneqqin defected to the Detemen League, if in a much diminished capacity. Still, those regiments entailed tens or even hundreds of thousands of soldiers, most of them on foot, but plenty more in various vehicles.
All of that placed an enormous logistical burden on the rebels.
"Have you thought about evacuating them?" Ves suggested. "I know you are in the possession of a space fleet."
"A small fleet, just enough to trade with the VRF and smuggle in some goods. Room is limited aboard a ship, and we simply don’t have the capacity to bring away all of the war materiel. The most we can do is to evacuate the soldiers without most of their equipment to escape House Eneqqin’s wrath when they eventually retake control over our planet."
The aftermath of this rebellion would provoke a furious backlash, especially if they managed to do something to Lord Javier. Ves could already imagine the cleansing that would ensue. Though Count Loqer would be limited by the laws of the Duchy and Kingdom, Ves expected plenty of blood to be spilled in the coming weeks.
Thinking about the consequences reaffirmed the fermenting idea in his mind that this operation didn’t pay off.
The more he spent time with the rebels, the more he began to question their motives. They all seem to love their home planet, so why didn’t they feel remorse over plunging Detemen IV into chaos?
Even if Lord Javier turned out to be a tyrant, the amount of damage he could inflict on a planet wasn’t even a tenth of the damage already being done by the rioting and pillaging happening on the surface.
Ves looked at Addy with a questioning eye and hesitated on bringing up his suspicions. Calling out the rebels in the middle of their base would not be wise. Besides, he might be wrong about them as well. If he said anything opportune, he would have ruined his relationship with them for nothing.
"WE’VE DETECTED A TRACE!"
Everyone in the data center stopped what they were doing and focused on the female analyst who called out her success.
"Show me!" Addy said and hurried over to the analyst’s terminal. Others quickly gathered around them and looked at the results projected from the terminal with awe.
"Four days ago, our sensors in this area caught a very weak signature. I didn’t expect much from them because the location of these sensors is rather far from the palace, but the matching program found a definite match for resonance profile 16!"
Ves turned to his own terminal and brought up the attributes of resonance profile 16. This profile put a little bit more emphasis on resonating one exotic over another. According to his judgment, this resonance profile would enable the Loquacious Raphael to amplify the effects of many types of explosive shells.
"From this point onwards, the sensors across this route only intermittently picked up the signals that closely resemble resonance profile 16. They signals ceased to be detected at the end of this projected route."
The projected map showed a broken line that started a decent distance away from the palace and began to meander towards a district that neighbored their current one. The signal took a lot of detours and loops, as if it tried to throw off its pursuers. After many hours of sidetracking, the signal finally stopped underneath a massive industrial recycling and salvaging plant.
"So that’s where Lord Javier is hiding!"
Ves had to give it to the bastard. A industrial recycling plant was one of the best locations to hide out. It was an extremely unpleasant place where old machinery and broken wrecks got broken down into raw materials.
This process was very energy intensive, and involved a huge amount of heavy alloys and composites. This effectively threw the entire location in a perceptual fog that made it difficult for most kinds of sensors to detect anything unusual in the vicinity.
"You did it, Mr. Larkinson! We sniffed him out!" Addy beamed as she became convinced of the veracity of the finding. "Alright boys and girls, let’s move out and hunt ourselves a noble!"
The entire base rang out in roars as every rebel pumped up their fists.
The rebel base turned into a whirlwind of activity. After several tense and fruitless days of searching, they finally found a trace of their elusive objective. As much as Lord Javier tried to hide his movements, in the end his faithful mech betrayed his probably location.
As the man who played an instrumental role in deducing Lord Javier’s hiding hole, Ves received a lot of appreciation from the rebels and Vandals around him. The Vandals all treated him with friendly slaps on the backs and the like, but the Vesian rebels all kept their distance from him and treated him like a high-class commoner.
Evidently, the Vesian class structure was too ingrained in their minds to act any differently.
Still, his latest accomplishment couldn’t have been done by anyone else but a mech designer with a broad base of knowledge. Ves had to lean on his extensive base of knowledge and his sharpened spirit to crack some of the secrets of the Loquacious Raphael.
What an impressive mech!
The more he learned about the hero mech, the more a sense of dread began to build within his bones. This was not a regular mech at all. From the amazing alloys used in its armor, to the powerful explosive shells that fed its rifle, every part of the Raphael spoke of an excellent degree of refinement.
"I can feel Mr. Reeve’s touch on its design. His Raphael definitely a labor of love."
A mech designer like Constantine Reeve needed to pull out all the stops when he designed a personalized mech for a special client. For a Senior of his caliber, Reeve must have charged a billion sovvies or more to House Eneqqin to create such a high-quality mech.
This was a mech that could easily stomp trash mechs by the dozen. The materials alone far exceeded regular premium mechs such as his gold label Blackbeaks and Crystal Lords. The advanced technologies incorporated practically doubled its value, while the added benefit of fake resonance doubled that sum once again.
"It’s a second-class mech that can go toe-to-toe with mechs of the Friday Coalition."
In all likelihood, the performance of the Loquacious Raphael exceeded the parameters of decent quality second-class mechs in most areas. Coupled with a skilled mech pilot that fit the mech like a glove, then the mech would certainly be able to surpass the performance of a regular second-class mech.
The amount of sovvies House Eneqqin put into training Lord Javier and equipping him with the best mech possible must have reached a staggering amount. Yet compared to the costs, the outcome would be worth it if Lord Javier became the strongest mech pilot of their House.
As long as his strength overwhelmed his siblings, there was no question whether he would inherit the title of count from his father!
The only curveball that could change this equation was if a branch member of the House advanced to become an expert pilot.
No matter how skilled Lord Javier might be, he would only be able to bully around regular and advanced mech pilots. The true elites of the Mech Corps and the Mech Legion would easily be able to turn the Loquacious Raphael into scrap.
The power of fake resonance simply couldn’t compare to true resonance.
"Expert mech pilots are too rare." Ves muttered. "Some mech regiments don’t even have one on their retainer."
Venerables enjoyed a privileged status in the Bright Republic, but they enjoyed outright worship in the Vesia Kingdom. Even the worst expert pilots became barons at an instant, which would forever enshrine their families into the ranks of nobility.
To their credit, the rebels and the Vandals came with as much force as they could muster in a short amount of time. Due to the impending arrival of Vesian reinforcements, they couldn’t afford to wait for every Vandal to convene in this part of the city.
Still, the Vandals somehow mustered well over seventy-five mechs. Capain Orfan and the mechs restored by Ves happened to be among their ranks.
When Captain Orfan’s looted mech congregated at the entrance of the rebel base, Ves didn’t know how to feel about her presence.
"It’s funny." He muttered. "For all her efforts, it turned out to be me who found Lord Javier’s trace."
Ves shook his head and didn’t think about Orfan anymore. The woman only did the best of her duties and Ves couldn’t fault her dedication to the mission. He instead spared a glance at the troop transports and hovertanks that the rebels prepared to accompany the Vandals.
Though they looked impressive, Ves couldn’t help but be dubious at their effectiveness. "The infantry will only get in the way, and the hovertanks won’t have enough room for maneuver if the battle erupts in an underground tunnel or hall.
Obviously, the mechs would take the lead while the infantry and the hovertanks acted as support. The recycling plant was a fairly large facility, and who knew what kind of complex lay beneath the ground. For that reason, the rebel auxiliary forces would secure the facility and the surroundings in order to relieve the Vandals of all their worries.
"No matter what, today is Lord Javier’s downfall!"
The rebels cheered at those words as Commander Breskin finished his brief speech. After that, the mechs and the auxiliary forces moved out.
Breskin and Addy quietly approached Ves as the remaining personnel looked on as mechs and vehicles disappeared into the streets.
"We still need your help, Mr. Larkinson." The commander spoke in a gentler tone than before. Before, Ves was just a forgettable mech designer. This time, the rebel leader as an asset. "We’d like you to monitor the battle and analyze the mechs at Lord Javier’s disposal. Our sources believe that his honor guard is also accompanying him. Count Loqer directly bestowed them to his son, so they’ll put up a good fight to defend him to the death."
Ves nodded. "I’ll get on it as soon as the battle starts."
He did not expect to make much of a contribution. The Loquacious Raphael alone displayed no obvious weak points, and the same could probably said for the mechs piloted by Lord Javier’s honor guard. Mechs of those caliber simply didn’t exhibit those kind of low-level design flaws.
As Ves took his seat in front of a terminal, he discovered that he had access to the feeds of every vehicle deployed by the rebels. Sadly, the rebels hadn’t built up the necessary amount of trust to patch into the feeds of the Vandal mechs, it was better than nothing.
"How soon until the battle starts?"
"In about forty minutes." Addy answered as she stood behind Ves. She constantly rotated among the analysts in order to coordinate their efforts. "Though the recycling plant isn’t too far away from here, we don’t want Lord Javier to slip away. We are gathering all our nearby tunnelers in order to collapse every underground escape route in the vicinity. Until that’s done, we don’t dare to launch our attack."
That made sense. Since Lord Javier was able to sneak to this place through a hidden tunnel, he could escape through similar means.
"Once our forces collapse the tunnels, how will the attack proceed?"
Addy began to frown. "We haven’t come up with a plan beyond that. Beyond confirming the presence of the Loquacious Raphael, we don’t know the terrain or how many enemies we’ll face. We do expect Lord Javier to be caught flatfooted though. He his his whereabouts extremely well so far, and if it wasn’t for your help, we would have never gotten to this point."
"You’re exaggerating!" Ves modestly smiled and scratched the back of his neck. "Any mech designer can do the same. I just happen to be the first one to piece together the clues."
He was definitely being modest here, but his accomplishments meant nothing if they failed to apprehend Lord Javier.
Both Addy and Ves became engrossed in several projections as they transmitted footage of the movements of the two allied forces.
Once the forces reached the recycling plants, the majority of the auxiliary forces split up and started to secure the adjacent streets and secure the other approaches.
If reinforcements arrived to bail Lord Javier out, then the rebels needed to stall their intrusion as long as possible.
The tanks meticulously hid behind the corners of structures that the infantrymen evacuated by force. They didn’t even bother to knock at any doors. They simply barged in with their exo-skeleton suits and dragged out every civilian, business owner and scum they could find.
"This is my home! Who gives you the right to drag me around!?"
"My workshop! Careful with that, it’s flammable!"
"Don’t kill me, please don’t kill me!"
The rebels uncovered many disgusting sights when they entered into certain abodes. Many criminals and gang members had run amuck in the last couple of days.
The exo-skeleton soldiers treated them all the same. Every obvious lowlife got a bullet in their heads. Ves applauded their decisiveness.
However, when it came to the actual attack plan, Captain Orfan who took charge on behalf of the Vandals clashed with Commander Breskin. The commander had opted to accompany the attack inside a mobile command center.
Addy patched into the command channel, allowing Ves and her to listen in from the rebel base.
"...I strongly object to your foolhardy suggestions!" Commander Breskin shouted over the channel. "Shelling the recycling plant will expend much of our ammunition and lead to a substantial amount of collateral damage! That recycling plant is a large source of income for Neron City, and it can ill afford its loss!"
"The plant is a massive obstacle and a nightmare to secure. Who knows how many defenses Javier has prepared at that plant. With the amount of activity taking place at the plant, we won’t be able to use our sensors at all. As long as the plant remains standing, we’ll be fighting with our hands tied behind our backs."
The two argued back and forth over several minutes, which caused their subordinates to grow apprehensive. There was no doubt that the recycling plant had detected their forces. One or two mechs could be hidden, but the presence of over a hundred mechs and vehicles could not be obscured at all.
Just as the argument ran over four minutes, a mutation happened on the streets. A series of explosions sounded out at the flanks.
"Lost contact with Wolf-353 and Wolf-664!"
Two hovertanks down!
Another explosion erupted at an adjacent street.
"Wolf-25 and Wolf-612 are downed! Wolf-55 is has sustained heavy damage and has lost all of its lifting capacity!"
The thunder of cannon fire rang through the streets, but another explosion finally shut down the street.
"Give me footage of Wolf-55’s final seconds!" Breskin ordered at the mobile command center.
Back at the base, Addy requested the same data. She possessed sufficient credentials in the rebel hierarchy to access this sort of sensitive materials. Ves looked at Addy and wondered whether she was Breskin’s daughter or something. She looked way too young and pretty to be a veteran rebel leader.
"Look!" Addy said, and Ves forcibly turned his head towards the projection of Wolf-55’s final recording. "It’s the Raphael!"
The mech peeked out from a hidden trapdoor built into the streets. It only needed to expose its upper body in order to fire ballistic rifle held within its arm.
Ves leaned closer and studied the Raphael’s weapon arm. As expected, the arm that held the rifle glowed in a shimmering rainbow pattern.
"It’s definitely the Raphael! In that case, Lord Javier should be very close!"
Unfortunately, a fair number of trapdoors littered the streets leading up to recycling center. Far from surrounding the recycling plant, the rebels instead spread their forces thin for Lord Javier to take them out one by one!
Commander Breskin sounded furious as he relayed his orders. "Give up on the envelopment and pull back! Don’t let this bastard son have his way!"
"Belay that, commander!" Captain Orfan spoke. "Stand your ground and pin down the Raphael. We are on our way as fast as possible! Help is on the way!"
"You don’t command us, Brighters! Ignore the mech captain’s words and fall back this instant!"
Despite the temporary confusion, most hover tanks and infantry units opted to pull back. Only a handful of vehicles remained in place.
The Raphael quickly popped up from a nearby trapdoor and took out every tank with a single shot of its potent rifle.
The rebels and the Vandals hadn’t even managed to fire back! They couldn’t even pin Lord Javier down!
Ves came up with one word to describe Lord Javier’s fighting style. "Shameless!"
Instead of hiding inside his hiding place like a rabbit shivering inside its burrow, Lord Javier evidently decided that the best defense was offensive. He boldly jumped on his adversaries before they could start to storm the recycling plant!
His actions brought incredible results. The hovertanks didn’t possess sufficient armor to withstand the enhanced explosive shells fired by the Raphael’s rifle. They all crumpled and blew apart when hit, and Lord Javier never seemed to miss.
Right now, the rebels and Vandals fell into further confusion at Lord Javier’s despicable tactic. The Loquacious Raphael completely went against its heroic tendencies. The surroundings of the recycling plant had obviously been prepared well in advance, leaving the attackers naked and vulnerable to the unknown.
All of it pointed to a trap.
"Pull back!"
"Retreat!"
Even Captain Orfan could no longer let this farce continue. Her spearman mech she appropriated from the Dastardly Handsome Bastards, simply couldn’t keep pace with Lord Javier’s movements.
They could only withdraw and figure out something else.
"Cowards!" Lord Javier broadcasted from his mech as it popped out yet again to wreck a couple of infantry transports. "Fight me if you dare!"
Every Vandal on the battlefield gnashed their teeth. Who dared to go toe-to-toe with his elite mech on a location of his choosing. They would obviously be sending themselves to their deaths if they meet Lord Javier on his terms!
While Lord Javier taunted his attackers, back at the base, Ves already started to analyze the Raphael. Though the sensors of the hovertanks only caught a couple of glimpses of the hero mech, footage of the Raphael in a live battle was very precious.
Ves constantly observed new details from its brief appearances.
He noticed something important. "The Loquacious Raphael isn’t carrying any spare magazines! Javier is likely replenishing his ammunitions from caches prepared in the tunnels!"
Addy relayed his observation to Commander Breskin, but it wasn’t what they needed to hear. They wanted a silver bullet that could cripple Lord Javier in a single blow.
Breskin mulled over his options as he rubbed his face. After a moment of consideration, he relayed new orders to his infantrymen. "Penetrate the underground tunnels and track down those ammunition caches. Destroy them all if you can, or mark them if you can’t. Move out!"
The infantry bravely went into action. Some of the soldiers were fully decked out in exo-skeleton suits, but others only wore varying levels of combat armor, much like what Ves wore at this moment.
Still, no matter what kind of armor they wore, they both wouldn’t last an instant against an attack from a mech. They faced instant death if they ever bumped into the Loquacious Raphael.
The first screams erupted two minutes after Breskin issued the orders. Ves switched his feed to the sensors of an exoskeleton soldier. The man tried to avoid an enemy mech while firing his heavy rifle at it, to no avail. Every bullet bounced from the mech’s thick armor until a foot finally stomped the exoskeleton soldier flat.
"Javier’s honor guard is patrolling the tunnels!"
Many infantry squads got massacred. Not a lot of soldiers reached the ammunition caches, but even then they couldn’t step any further, because each cache was guarded by a handful of turrets with enough firepower to deter a medium mech.
"Commander, we can’t complete our objective!"
Breskin cursed up a storm at that news. Eventually, he sounded the retreat. Apart from mapping out parts of the tunnel, they hadn’t gained a lot of benefits.
His eyes turned over to his allies. "Captain Orfan, many of my men have sacrificed themselves, while your mechs are running back and forth. Don’t you think you should make a contribution?"
"Twelve minutes."
"What?"
"We’ve deployed a countermeasure against the tunnels. We highly urge you to evacuate your forces at least six-hundred meters away from the recycling plant!"
The mechs already stopped their useless chance and began to fall back in an orderly fashion. Their ranged mechs pointed their gun barrels in each direction while the melee mechs positioned themselves in a way that allowed them to pounce on the Raphael if it emerged somewhere close.
"Run if you can! No matter where you flee, I’ll kill you before you escape my planet!" Javier laughingly taunted.
No matter the soundness of their actions, retreating in the face of an enemy hurt their self-esteem. Javier’s taunts only rubbed in the humiliation. Yet they listened to Captain Orfan and Commander Breskin because they recognized the danger of their surroundings.
Before neutralizing Javier’s advantage of the terrain, it wasn’t wise to make a forceful push.
Several minutes passed by as the two forces successfully pulled back. The entire area around the recycling plant had been thrown into disarray. Amidst the damaged and destroyed hovertanks, a lot of civilians looked out the windows of their apartments, offices and workplaces with apprehension.
In order to make this area appear as normal as possible, Lord Javier hadn’t done anything to chase the nearby citizens away. It would be too conspicuous if every citizen had been chased away from this important location. Their ignorance formed the best kind of camouflage for the heir.
Too bad he didn’t count on his mech giving away his position. The civilians completely lost their utility now that the game was up. Many concerned civilians gathered together for safety or because they were scared. Children clung to their mothers as they endured yet another frightening event.
"What’s happening next?" Ves asked Addy.
"I’m not certain, Mr. Larkinson. We’ve underestimated Lord Javier’s preparations. This isn’t a hasty setup at all. We don’t even know how he managed to prepare the field without us getting wind of it. We shouldn’t have missed the extensive tunnel complex around the recycling plant!"
Ves didn’t blame the rebels for the oversight. A lot of heavy activity went on at that plant, which caused it to throw a lot of interference in the air. The activity far surpassed what went on in a mech manufacturing plant because breaking down broken products into useful resources took an immense amount of effort.
Orfan and Breskin feared the unknown. Who knew what else lurked in these tunnels and how many other traps Lord Javier prepared. At the very least, they should scout out the underground terrain extensively before doing anything else.
Yet even on this issue, Captain Orfan and Commander Breskin held differences of opinion.
"We should bomb half the district flat. Give us the word, and we can demolish every structure and expose the tunnels within an hour."
"Out of the question!" Breskin roared back. "There are thousands of civilians living in the vicinity of this plant! A significant amount of people who live in the nearby apartments are the women and children of the plant workers!"
The two argued back and forth on this matter with so much vitriol that Ves palmed his face. "At least evacuate the civilians. They have no reason to be present there!"
Some nearby apartment blocks got hit by the shockwave of the Raphael’s explosive shells. Many windows shattered from the blasts, and several civilians sustained heavy injuries from the shockwaves and flying shrapnel.
"Detecting unknown objects descending from orbit!" Someone in the base abruptly announced.
Ves turned away from Addy, who was relaying some instructions to the rebels on the field to call for the civilians to evacuate. Cherishing their lives, most of the people who lived there ran from the district as fast as their legs could urge them forward. Others entered various vehicles and made an even faster getaway.
"Objects identified! They’re... they’re artificial meteorites!"
"What’s their trajectory?!" Addy asked with widened eyes.
"They’re on course to impact the vicinity of the recycling plant!"
Everyone stopped when they heard that. The artificial meteorites could have only been sent from one source, which was the only force that held orbital supremacy over Detemen IV.
"Mr. Larkinson!" Addy shouted with fury and abruptly approached him and grabbed his shoulders. She tried to drag him up his feet, but his combat armor and firm body prevented her from gaining any purchase. She opted to grab his hair instead. "What have you Vandals done?!"
"I have no idea! I’m not a Vandal, and I’m not in their chain of command!"
It was obvious what the Vandals had done. While it was a war crime to bombard a location from orbit with meteorites or other debris that floated in space, nothing was said about artificial weapons.
The bottom line of the MTA was that any weapon employed within human space against a human adversary needed to small enough to be deployed by a mech.
Artificial meteorites formed something of a loophole of that rule. Most often, the meteorites were up to half as large as the mechs that launched them. Nobody dared to make them any bigger for fear of running afoul of the MTA’s taboo on weapons of mass destruction.
When a meteorite was big enough, they could wipe out entire cities or continents.
Forces in space often resorted to artificial meteorites due to their low cost and incredible convenience. The launching mechanism consisted of nothing more than the mechs pushing them towards a planet with their limbs. Small boosters built into the artificial meteorites took over from there, and insured the meteorites would roughly land where they were supposed to hit.
The problem right now wasn’t that the Vandals resorted to artificial meteorites, but that they went ahead and launched them without consulting their local partners on the ground!
To say that the Detemen League was incensed was putting it lightly!
"The evacuation isn’t complete! Over twenty percent of them has made it out of the probable blast site! The rest won’t make it out in time!"
"Who ordered this orbital strike?!" Commander Breskin repeated again over the command channel.
"I did." A new voice interrupted. Ves recognized the voice of Major Verle. "On my authority as the highest commanding officer of the 6th Flagrant Vandals, I agreed with Captain Orfan’s suggestion to strike the area from orbit."
The spaceborn mech officer was evidently back in command over the detachment orbiting above Detemen IV after surviving the Stubby Growler’s destruction.
"Heartless filth from the Republic! Countless lives will be lost!"
"No more than what the rioting populace have already inflicted upon themselves. Sometimes, sacrifices must be made. The longer we equivocate about the matter, the higher the chance that Lord Javier will spring another surprise on us. He might even be attempting to flee!"
The Loquacious Raphael hadn’t shown itself after the attackers pulled back their forces. Perhaps whatever command center House Eneqqin erected underneath the recycling plant detected the incoming artificial meteorites as well.
Not even the best mechs could withstand the sheer kinetic force of a falling meteorite. Artificial ones were much deadlier than natural ones because they had been purpose-built to do survive entry into the atmosphere. The Loquacious Raphael had no chances of survival even if the artificial meteorite landed next to the mech!
"Impact in three minutes!"
"Stop the meteorites! Shoot them down!" Breskin ordered.
"Don’t! Stay your hand!"
"Ignore this murdering Brighter and execute my orders! Use every anti-air battery and missile platform in range!"
A multitude of lasers and projectiles soared into the air. Hundreds of missiles followed suit. Due to the predictable trajectory and the incredible density of the artificial meteorites, even the dumbest targeting systems could land a hit on the falling objects.
Sadly, the lasers barely accomplished anything but melt some potholes on the surface of the heat-resistant meteorites. The kinetic impacts from the ballistic projectiles hardly even chipped away at their surface, while the explosions from the missiles only caused their surface to crack a bit.
The meteorites were too tough!
"Impact in one minute!"
Practically nothing could be done. With one minute to go, Ves envisioned almost complete devastation from the orbital strike. Even the tunnel network underneath would collapse in the face of fury from space!
One might think that the most precious resource in a battle consisted of manpower. Without able men and women trained to fight, no force would be able to sustain themselves in battle.
Others might argue that mechs counted for more. A force that invested in the quantity and quality of their mechs would possess more depth and options even if their mech pilots fell short.
Through the progression of the battle on Detemen IV, Ves learned that both manpower and mechs played second fiddle to the most crucial resource of all: time.
"There’s never enough time."
The entire operation on the Detemen System rested on the premise that the Flagrant Vandals and the Detemen League could complete their objectives within four days.
If they stuck around longer than that, then enemy reinforcements might arrive to close their window of escape.
The rebels numbered hundreds of thousands at the very least. Though most didn’t possess any exceptional skills, it was undeniable that they had numbers on their side, or else they wouldn’t have been able to wrest control of the auxiliary regiments that guarded the planet.
The only downside was that they hadn’t been able to cultivate a mech force that could compete for global hegemony on the planet.
As for the 6th Flagrant Vandals, as a legitimate mech regiment, their numbers was only a fraction to the rebels, and only about two-thousand of them consisted of the actual fighters. Yet their ability to fight was arguably more superior than the Detemen League due to their abundant ships and mechs.
Both of them had managed to overwhelm the defenses around Neron City and enjoyed free reign in certain parts of the city. While a lot of different outfits still possessed enough mechs to resist the Vandals, their internal rivalry and mistrust ruled out the possibility of forming a common front against the invaders.
Over at the manufacturing district, the Vandals picked their targets carefully. They didn’t overwhelm every manufacturing complexes in their way with brute force, but rather focused their efforts on a handful of plants at a time. Through this fashion, they deliberately let off valuable sites whose defenders sighed in relief.
The company defenders of the complexes that had been spared all thanked their lucky stars that the Vandals chose to pass them by. They had zero incentive to bail out the industrial sites that the Vandals raided.
In fact, the lucky ones even cheered the Vandals on for ruining their competitors and make it easy for them to expand their businesses after this ordeal.
Yet while the Vandals achieved a decent amount of success in one of their objectives, the hunt for Lord Javier consumed far too much time. The noble’s whereabouts only became known on the last day of the operation, and it wouldn’t be easy to take him into custody.
"Lord Javier is a tough bone to chew." Ves surmised.
Not only did he pilot the Loquacious Raphael, which was arguably the best mech on the planet, he also relied on the protection of his elite honor guard. Furthermore, the entire area around the recycling plant was riddled with traps and tunnels.
The attacking force made out of Vandal mechs and rebel auxiliary troops faced two unappealing options.
The most direct option was to push through regardless of the cost. No matter how many traps Lord Javier prepared, it was undeniable that he didn’t bring too much mechs when he escaped the palace.
Still, anyone could imagine the cost might not be worth it. Depending on how well Lord Javier and House Eneqqin prepared their battlefield, the Vandals might lose all of the mechs committed to this assault.
The other option would be to take it slow. This was the most proper response to the situation the attackers faced. By scouting ahead and detecting the traps beforehand, they could easily dismantle them one by one before they exploded in their faces.
The problem with this choice was that it would take days or even weeks to tighten the envelope around Lord Javier’s hideout. This course of action might be viable in other campaigns, but in the time-sensitive operation of the Vandals, they needed to scram from this star system by the end of the day or risk never coming back to Republic space.
In essence, the defenders deliberately served an unpalatable binary choice to Vandals and the rebels. Taking it slowly was out of question, and barging on ahead would lead to unacceptable losses.
The mastermind behind this defense plan therefore hoped that the attackers would pick the third option, which was to give up on Lord Javier and abandon any thoughts of pushing through.
Commander Breskin and the rebels already leaned towards this exit that the defenders had magnanimously prepared for them. Although failing to take out Lord Javier would discredit their organization, they could always make a comeback.
The Vandals on the other hand couldn’t afford to fail when they were so close to completing this objective. They staked much more than their credibility, but locked themselves into a contract with the opposition forces within the Vesia Kingdom.
If they stepped away at this critical moment, then their return to friendly space might be in question.
This was why Major Verle rejected all three options, and chose a fourth instead. When facing an elaborately prepared board set up by their opponent, the best solution wasn’t to play the game on the enemy’s terms.
No. The best solution was to flip the board entirely.
The artificial meteorites sent down from orbit plummeted through the atmosphere like the wrathful hammers of a god. The sheer kinetic energy these meteorites could unleash was unimaginable. Though anti-air batteries successfully shattered a handful of of the hardy meteorites through sheer weight of fire, that still left around a dozen more.
The fleet in space already estimated the amount of anti-air fire the meteorites would be subjected to. They flung enough of the meteorites to push through the storm and make it to the surface.
Half a minute before the first impact, every civilian still in range despaired. Madness and resignation took over, and a few of them even did things they never would have done if not for the glowing specs streaking towards their location from the air.
"HAHAHAHA! It’s the end of the world!"
"Shhh honey. Don’t cry. It will all end soon."
"Screw Lord Javier and screw the Brighters! They can all go to hell!"
The Vandal and rebel forces evacuated as far as they could. Even though they escaped the most acute danger zone, they could still suffer a substantial amount of damage by staying in the vicinity. Once time almost ran out for them, they braced their vehicles and mechs as best they could.
Even Ves, Addy and the others in the underground rebel base huddled into their crash seats. Ves put his helmet back over his head, enclosing him in his worn but serviceable light combat armor.
Someone projected the ticker for the first impact above their heads.
"Brace for impact!"
Three. Two. One.
BRRRRRMMM!
A huge roar sounded out in the distance, and various vibrations and shocks ran throughout the entire underground base. Substances fell from the ceiling while some of the haphazardly piled crates fell over. Several rebels cried out in pain as these crates smashed against their bodies.
The deep shakes and vibrations continued in succession as more artificial meteorites landed on the ground and unleashed all of the energy they built up in a single instant to the ground and its surroundings.
Through the projections of the impact area, they witnessed the devastation as it progressed.
The first artificial meteorite landed directly on the recycling plant itself. The large structure crumpled instantly became engulfed in a massive upheaval that destroyed the entire complex.
Other meteorites devastated the area around the annihilated plant. Dozens of structures disintegrated like crumbling sand, much of which the collision launched far into the air. Debris rained like apocalyptic ash many kilometers away, causing hundreds and thousands of unsuspecting citizens to lose their lives.
A handful of mechs, troop transports and hovertanks sustained incidental damage as well. Two mechs even got hit by aircar-sized chunks that almost crippled them. At their current state, they lost at least half of their combat effectiveness.
As for the area within the danger zone, virtually no civilian made it out alive. The kinetic impact, the ensuing shockwaves, the raining debris and more all turned the danger zone into an area of death. Without any form of protection, a human stood no chance of survival.
Those who cowered underground fared no better. The reason why forces in space still resorted to artificial meteorites was because as much as the damage on the surface looked bad, they inflicted the same level of destruction to any underground construction in the vicinity.
Many tunnels collapsed outright as the powerful impacts rearranged the underground terrain. Vast craters emerged in the place of boltholes and panic rooms. The massive tunnel complex that House Eneqqin prepared to play with their opposition transformed into upturned soil that was indistinguishable from the ruinous terrain.
As the impacts and immediate destruction subsided, everyone in the underground base lowered their guard.
No one celebrated their survival. Instead, they stared at the shaky footage of the aftermath of what the artificial meteorites had wrought.
"You bastards!" One rebel suddenly shouted and started to assault a nearby logistics officer from the Vandals. "Now I know why you’re called the Flagrant Vandals! It’s because you have no compulsion to destroy everything in your way!"
"Cut it out!" Addy yelled, and quickly ordered her more level-headed subordinates to pull the maddened rebel away. "What happened was tragic, and we will definitely account for it with the Vandals, but this is not the time to fall out with our allies!"
Through a mixture of persuasion and cajoling, Addy successfully managed to keep a lid on any potential outbursts. Ves quietly sighed in relief and loosened his armored hand.
If the rebels truly turned on the Vandals, Ves would have pulled out the Amastendira without hesitation. For now, he could keep his weapon a secret for a while longer.
A few minutes after the disaster, the rebels sent out various bugs and floating sensors. An increasingly detailed picture emerged from ground zero. The footage sickened most of the occupants of the base.
Ves was no different, even though he understood the brutal chain of logic behind Major Verle’s decision. Just because he recognized that throwing down a bunch of heavy objects from orbit was the most expedient solution to their dilemma, didn’t mean he agreed with the decision.
Yet what else could Major Verle have done? Give out a warning and delay the launch? Giving the civilians the time to evacuate the impact site would also provide the same opportunity to Lord Javier and his honor guard.
They could not let the slippery bastard slither out of their grasp again.
"We’re not done yet." Ves spoke, cutting through the fog and depression that hung over most of the rebels. "A proper underground stronghold is always meant to withstand weapons of mass destructions. If Lord Javier and his escorts fled into their strongholds in time, they won’t be taken out by a bunch of meteorites."
The possibility that Lord Javier survived was in fact very strong. The artificial meteorites managed to inflict a lot of damage, but beyond the immediate impact site, the damage quickly spread out. A tough enough bunker wouldn’t crack under the pressure.
"You heard the man! Deploy more bugs and focus them underground! Find me their bunkers and mark their locations!"
It would be too easy for Lord Javier to perish from such a banal attack.
The investigation quickly confirmed his guess.
"We’ve detected a major bunker underneath the recycling plant! It’s.. it’s partially intact!"
A score of mechs and hovertanks proceeded towards the site. While the mechs had trouble finding their footing in the complex terrain, the hovertanks displayed no strain as they hovered over the debris that used to be places where people worked and lived.
This time, the fight against Lord Javier proceeded in a completely different way. The meteorites wiped out the tunnels and traps, leaving the Vesian noble with very few advantages.
As some of the Vandal scouts approached the vicinity of the bunker, a hatch opened up. The Loquacious Raphael emerged from underneath and returned to the outside world.
Nine honor guard mechs followed in its footsteps.
Four of them consisted of melee bestial mechs. They all looked like robust tigers with an excellent balance between speed and armor. Up close, their jaws could crunch mech limbs while their claws could tear apart armor plating.
The rest of them consisted of ranged mechs of various configurations. All of them were humanoid, and all of them carried an abundant amount of gear.
Over forty mechs stopped at the other end of the path leading up to the bunker. Their surroundings had turned into a complex landscape of craters and collapsed structures, which made it exceedingly complex to navigate. Only the former main street offered somewhat flat terrain.
The Loquacious Raphael stepped forward in a dusty but dazzling display. For some reason, the blue and silver hero mech acquired a white cape that looked dazzling in the midst of ruin. The mech extended out its sword to the approaching Vandal scout mechs.
"Devils!" Lord Javier’s young voice boomed over the broken lands. "Your evil knows no bounds! To bombard my planet from orbit without any hesitation reveals your cruel nature! If this is what your corrupt Republic has taught you, then you deserve to die!"
"What?" Ves asked. What was Lord Javier going on about?
"Lord Javier." Captain Orfan spoke up from her spearman mech. "Cut the nonsense and obediently surrender. You are outnumbered eight-to-one, and that’s only when you count the mechs. Your tunnels are collapsed and your escape routes are blocked. There is no chance for you to make it out alive if you choose to fight. Do the smart thing, and we won’t have to take this any further than we already have."
The Rapheal swung its sword in a theatrical manner. "Surrender? Never! My people have died under my watch! So long as you Vandals are still alive, my mission is not yet done! Prepare yourselves, villains, for I shall cleanse this star system of Brighter filth!"
An analyst in the base suddenly stood up from behind his terminal. "This is bad! Lord Javier is showboating in front of the entire Kingdom!"
Ves looked over and saw a local news portal commenting on a live feed of Lord Javier’s speech.
So the man acted sanctimoniously for a reason!
"Cut the feed! Destroy his recorders!"
"We’re working on it but there’s too much! Some of them are extremely well hidden! Without taking over the entire site, we won’t be able to take them all out!"
The invasion of the Detemen System had always been broadcasted to the news portals on both sides of the war. At the beginning, the Bright Republic pounced on the feeds as a way to boost the morale of their citizens who felt weary at hearing about another loss or stalemate.
Though the Mech Corps always treated the Flagrant Vandals like an abandoned son, now that they grabbed the spotlight, they temporarily changed their stance.
The battle at Detemen II and Detemen IV provided a riveting display of their own side. The people back home relished seeing Vesians getting ground beneath the foot of the Vandals.
As for the Vesians, they had all been juiced up by the initial successes at the outbreak of the war. The quick invasions and the rapid takeover of the border systems gave them an inflated feeling of confidence. The war would go different this time, and victory was already in the bag.
This sudden attack on the heartland of the Kingdom not only disabused them of this notion, it also put the seed of fear into their hearts.
If a formerly safe place like the Detemen System could be raided, what about their own home systems? Many Vesians never believed that their star system would be vulnerable to the Mech Corps. In the previous wars, the Bright Republic almost never struck at the Kingdom, and what few raids they sent almost always struck the Vesian border systems.
Now, the commoners of the Kingdom started to fear that this might change. If the Flagrant Vandals got away, who could tell they wouldn’t pull off the same long-ranged assault again?
Strangely enough, looking at Lord Javier spouting justice against the evil Brighters served to allay some of their apprehensions. With heroes like Lord Javier in charge, the Flagrant Vandals would never go unpunished!
Ves didn’t know whether he wanted to laugh or cry. This spoiled, abusive brat with one of the most awful reputation in the Detemen System portrayed himself as a righteous Vesian. The worst part of it was that almost every news portal in the Kingdom lapped it up.
In fact, they actively promoted him. Lord Javier’s face got plastered all over the Vesia Kingdom’s galactic net, and more and more citizens tuned into the broadcast of the ongoing battle.
Addy walked back to Ves and shook her head. "This is how the media works in the Kingdom. Every major news portal is in the hands of the Duchies or the Royals. They won’t ever spin this battle as a loss."
"Shouldn’t there be a lot more independent news outlets in the Kingdom? It’s very hard to block everything on the galactic net. Besides, there’s also the larger news outlets that serve entire star sectors or larger, like the Rimward Star Herald."
"Hahaha!" Addy laughed. "It’s funny how naive you are something! Don’t put your trust into both. The larger news portals aren’t interested in what they consider to be a minor spat. As for the so-called independent news portals, nobody ever follows them, because what they report doesn’t match with the rosy picture that the government-owned outlets publishes."
That sounded really strange to Ves. The Bright Republic exhibited a much less tightly regulated press environment. Opinions diverged wildly, and it was a challenge to pick the right news portal to believe, but overall the Republic famously touted itself as a state that upheld the torch of human civilization.
Addy noticed his confusion. "Think of it this way. When you hear news that you don’t want to hear, you won’t feel glad. Only when you listen to the government-owned media will you feel more comfortable, because you are used to the uplifting news they try to serve you every day."
Ves understood her argument, but couldn’t completely wrap his head around it. The news was the news. Sometimes, they publicised something good, but they also had a duty to let the people know of things that didn’t work very well.
"Ah nevermind." The rebel woman sighed and turned to one of the feeds. "I think Lord Javier is about to end his speech."
"...If you will not lay down your arms, we will take you by force!" Captain Orfan yelled and brandished the spear of her stolen mech.
"If you wish to take away my arms, then come and take them! I can guarantee you that you will never lay your filthy hands on my weapons!"
"Open Fire!"
The negotiation broke down and both sides fired off their long-ranged weapons. The weight of fire on the side of the attackers was like a thunderstorm raining down in the direction of the Raphael and its honor guard. Scores of laser beams and projectiles forced them to dodge and crawl to the sides.
The hovertanks floating in the rear provided a lot of long-ranged fire support. While their fire wasn’t very accurate, whenever they hit, they dealt as much damage as a mech cannon.
As for the defenders, the ranged mechs all fired as they ran. The quality of their rifles surpassed those of their adversaries. The mechs used by the Vandals also fell short in terms of quality. In fact, their larger numbers and the cramped terrain made it easier for the Raphael and its buddy mechs to land some hits.
The Raphael zigged and zagged as it charged up its fake resonance. The rifle arm glowed like a rainbow, and adjusted the aim of its one-handed ballistic rifle. "Rainbow Shell!"
A glowing shell fired from the rifle and rapidly cut the air until it impacted on a Vandal light mech. The shell exploded in a gout of rainbow fury, and the blast was at least twice as powerful as the regular shells that wrecked the hovertanks with a single hit.
The light mech hadn’t survived! Its cockpit belatedly launched into the air, but the rest of the mech was almost a total loss. The resonance-enhanced shell had managed to break the light mech’s thin torso armor and inflict crippling damage to its internals.
"Hahaha! None of your mechs stand a chance against my Loquacious Raphael! Take this! Rainbow Shell!"
Another charged shell spat out from the muzzle of the glowing rifle. The shell impacted a medium mech this time and fractured a lot of armor. The Vandal mech survived the impact, but looked a lot worse off. It wouldn’t be able to handle another round!
"Tch! You’re lucky your vital components hadn’t gotten hit, but your luck won’t last! Rainbow Shell!"
This time, Lord Javier aimed at the approaching form of Captain Orfan’s spearman mech. The captain possessed much better reflexes and battle awareness, so she already started dodging her mech as soon as the noble called out the name of his attack.
There was no reason for Javier to call out his special techniques! In his time with the Vandals, Ves heard a lot of stories about resonance. One of them was that evoking this phenomenon in the heat of battle could be exceedingly hard, because the mech pilot needed to be at their best and put forth all of their concentration into achieving heir desired outcome.
By putting a name on a specific resonance pattern and saying it out loud whenever they engaged it, mech pilots came to resort to this method as a crutch.
Over time, whenever they said the name of their technique, they would unconsciously facilitate the activation of the resonance profile that they desired to unleash.
Still, even if saying the names out loud helped a bit, there was no reason for Lord Javier to keep his broadcasting speakers on! It was as if he was acting like the main character of an action drama!
Eventually, the exchange of fire died down when the Raphael and the honor guard dove into the complex terrain around them. "Catch me if you can!"
"Surround this site and track him down! He won’t be able to get very far!"
The battle progressed to another stage as both sides dove into the ruined landscape. Due to the extreme terrain, ranged mechs lost most of their advantages. The narrow corridors and abundant hills heavily favored melee mechs.
Ves looked on from a bug positioned above, and caught a glimpse of the Raphael darting forward to one of the Vandal mechs. Due to a lack of space in the immediate environment, the Vandal mechs had been forced to march in a single column. This allowed the Raphael to face it without any interference from the other Vandal mechs.
"Twin Star Slash!"
The Raphael’s sword didn’t glow or exhibit any remarkable effects, but the manner in which Lord Javier controlled his mech was something else. The arm rapidly flicked back and forth in a rapid sequence of movements. While their penetration power left much to be desired, the so-called Twin Star Slash had somehow manage to cut off the hands of the Vandal mech in front.
"Twin Star Helix!"
The Raphael’s hand rotated around itself as it stabbed forth its sword. The completely useless drilling motion actually made it harder to penetrate the armor of the Vandal mech, but once it dug in with the help of the Raphael’s weight, it started to inflict a load of damage.
The Vandal pilot panicked and ejected in reflex. The cockpit almost bumped against the head of the friendly mech standing behind it as it made its way out of the site.
"Next!" Javier called out with a laugh. He was enjoying this!
It became evident that the upturned terrain played to House Eneqqin’s advantage. The abundant amount of obstacles and cover played to their advantage. While their elite ranged mechs couldn’t shoot at the Vandal mechs, neither would the Vandals be able to use their weight of numbers in melee and ranged mechs to bear.
The choke points that Lord Javier and his honor guard held for seconds at a time before squirreling away always forced the Vandals to fight the Vesian mechs in one-to-one duels.
A knight piloted by a seasoned Vandal clashed violently against the Vesian tiger mech. While most felinid mechs emphasized speed and agility, the honor guard bestial mechs carried a lot more armor than usual, allowing it to not lose out too much when it pitted its physical weight against the knight.
"You’re outnumbered! Surrender now or be ground into dust!" The knight broadcasted.
The tiger mech wrenched up a claw to parry the incoming sword slash. "The only ones who will turn into dust are invaders like you!"
The two mechs pushed against each other, trying to bully their opponents with their weight. The Vandal burgundy and black provided a stark contrast against House Eneqqin’s astral blue and silver.
The clashes grew more violently, but neither side got the upper edge. The knight mech possessed more throwing weight, but the tiger mech possessed a firmer footing. The differences in mech shapes led to a lot of complexities.
Unfortunately, the Vandal pilots lacked experience dealing with bestial mechs. Though they often trained against them in simulations, they never got to fight against them a lot in the real universe.
That proved devastating as an another tiger mech jumped from behind the tiger mech locked in combat. The second bestial mech jumped against a wall of debris with its four limbs and used it as a platform to change its trajectory and swoop at the knight mech from its flank!
"What?!"
The second tiger mech’s jump happened too fast for the knight mech to respond. In addition, the front tiger mech tied the knight mech down by doubling up its aggression.
The Vandal mechs at the rear tried to move forward to help, but the bottleneck hindered their approach.
A massive crunching sound emerged as the second tiger mech chomped the knight mech’s sword arm. Its forward momentum also caused it to slam against the knight, which completely destabilized its footing. Another hard wrench caused the tiger mech to savage the sword arm as it tried to pull it out of its socket.
While the tiger mech eventually failed to do so, the other tiger mech pounced on the knight mech which was in no shape to defend and tore apart its chest armor with repeated claw strikes.
The Vandal pilot finally had enough. His cockpit ejected from his mech before the claws could go past the chest armor and do more damage.
Further ahead, the Loquacious Raphael clashed against a Vandal swordsman mech. Though the latter mech’s quality couldn’t measure up against the Raphael, its mech pilot excelled at defense. Lord Javier’s habit of broadcasting his special moves even allowed him to move in advance.
"Twin Star Meteor Storm!"
The Raphael’s sword glowed like a comet as it hacked down onto the Vandal swordsman mech in quick succession. The flurry of blows contained little elegance, and the glow was just a cosmetic addition to the sword instead of an indicator of resonance.
Nevertheless, the swordsman mech struggled to defend against the might and frequency of attacks. Even though the Raphael only wielded its sword in one arm, the sheer strength in them was enough to push back the Vandal mech despite wielding its broadsword with both hands.
"I need some help here!"
A Vandal rifleman mech approached from behind the swordsman mech and tried to lean to the side in order to unleash a volley of explosive shells.
Lord Javier noticed the maneuvering and grinned. "Villains! Fight me one-on-one if you dare!"
"This isn’t an arena! Ignore his words and pile up on him!"
"Take this then! Combo attack: Twin Rainbow Helix!"
The Raphael charged up its resonating rifle arm, channeling an ungodly amount of energy in the rifle. The swordsman mech desperately surged forward in order to interrupt Lord Javier’s so-called combo attack, but the Rapheal’s sword deftly slowed down its progress.
The rifle unleashed a spinning rainbow shell that impacted the swordsman mech’s chest and blew up in a directional fashion. Most of the energies unleashed by the explosion was directed further into the mech, causing the swordsman mech to stagger.
Immediately after the explosion wracked the chest armor, a spinning sword entered the opening in the chest armor and churned past the weakened armor layers without effort. The sword kept spinning as it entered deep inside the chest until it rammed through the cockpit and blended the pilot inside into hashed meat.
"NO!" The mech pilot of the rifleman mech yelled. The ranged mech fired a barrage of shells at close range. Most of them hit the Raphael head on but its frontal armor consisted of high-quality compressed armor that easily endured the rifle shells.
"Hahahaha! Villains like you are unqualified to sully my Raphael!" Lord Javier taunted as he jerked his mech’s sword from its latest kill while bringing up his ballistic rifle.
The Raphael quickly unleashed a salvo of unenhanced shells. Unlike the Raphael, the rifleman mech was a lot more fragile. The three shells all landed on its chest, causing the frontal armor to be crumpled into pieces.
Just as the rifleman mech wanted to retreat, the Raphael jumped over the wreck of the swordsman mech and chopped down with its sword, which sliced through the weakened chest in a single blow.
The rifleman mech tipped over as the internal damage caused it to lose all power. Before the pilot could eject, the Raphael stomped its open chest with its foot, causing the cockpit and its occupant to be fattened into a pancake.
"Brighter scum deserve no quarter!"
Just as the Raphael surged forth with its majestic red cape flapping in the wind, a barrage of long-ranged lasers and kinetic projectiles slammed into its rear. The cape instantly gained a couple of holes and the custom mech’s rear armor gained some dents.
"Treacherous cowards!" Javier yelled in frustration as he urged his mech out of the bottleneck and into cover. "You’ll pay for turning my regiments against me!"
The rebel-controlled hovertanks finally showed their utility. Though they normally hovered a few meters above the ground to minimize their energy consumption, they could also float higher in the air if they wished.
In the absence of aerial mechs, they formed the versatile units in the air. Normally, they would never float in the air and expose themselves in such a reckless manner. The hovertanks waited close to the ground as the rebels spent almost all of their available manpower in destroying every nearby anti-air turret that exposed their positions as they attempted to stop the artificial meteorites.
With every anti-air turret in the vicinity taken out, the hovertanks floated above the rubble and hills of debris until they gained a clear line of sight of the Vesian mechs. Their powerful cannon muzzles fired a variety of lasers, shells and projections that wouldn’t lose out from what an Akkara heavy mech could unleash.
"Annoying thiefs!" Lord Javier yelled as his mech and his honor guard all pulled back. The hovertanks started to surround them in a circle, granting them no respite no matter where they hid behind. "Don’t think you can use my property against me without a price!"
The Loquacious Raphael transmitted a wide-area signal that reached every hovertank in the vicinity.
Five of them instantly lost power and plummeted to the ground. The height of the fall and the force of the impact practically killed every crewmember inside the vehicles.
Unfortunately, only the latest model of hovertanks had been taken out this way. Plenty more remained aloft. The rebels had long scoured their systems for backdoors and other vulnerabilities. The reason why the latest model ultimately failed was because the auxiliary regiments only received them a few months ago.
"Keep up the pressure! Lord Javier won’t be able to shut us down!" The tank commander urged his crews.
The hovertanks couldn’t maneuver very fast in the air, and they also needed to slow down in order to lay down accurate fire, but their crews possessed enough training to minimize their exposure until they were ready to fire.
The honor guard’s ranged mechs stopped supporting the Raphael and the tiger mechs in order to suppress the hovertanks bobbing in the air. Both the mechs and the tanks played it safe, so they didn’t make a lot of progress in the short term.
Only the Raphael’s rifle could take them down in a single hit, and only if it employed its resonance.
Lord Javier lost some of his joviality as the hovertanks entered the battle. He couldn’t pull back and shoot down the floating vehicles as his presence was very integral in stopping the Vandal mechs in their tracks. His tiger mechs wouldn’t be able to halt all of the Vandal mechs by themselves.
While Commander Breskin and Captain Orfan hadn’t communicated any plans, they adjusted to each other’s movements as if they were part of the same unit.
The Vandals stopped trying to press forward and merely tried to tie their adversaries down.
Meanwhile, the rebel hovertanks slowly chipped away at the honor guard mechs. They not only threatened their ranged mechs, they also put some pressure on the tiger mechs, forcing them to be less brazen unless they wished to be filled with holes.
The cramped terrain turned from an advantage to a disadvantage to House Eneqqin’s mechs. While they took full advantage of the broken terrain to bottleneck their opponents so that their superior numbers amounted to nothing, the presence of the hovertanks and their ability to disregard most obstacles turned their advantage back into a disadvantage.
The confined spaces limited their range of motion, and they simply didn’t have any room to dodge.
Lord Javier gritted his teeth as his Raphael pulled back. The mech’s rifle was extremely powerful and already took out numerous Vandal mechs and hovertanks, but its magazine emptied out very quickly.
When the Raphael initially emerged from the bunker, Javier ordered a backpack module to be attached to its back. Beneath its tattered cape rested an ammunition carrier.
The Raphael quickly sent a signal to the rifle, causing it to detach and drop its spent magazine. The mech then maneuvered its rifle to its back in a specific position. A fresh magazine emerged from an opening of the backpack module and slammed into the breech of the weapon.
Having finished its reloading process, the Raphael jumped back into the action with its rifle arm glowing brighter.
"Triple Rainbow Shell!"
The rifle unleashed three shells in quick succession. Each of them somehow accurately hit three hovertanks that dipped down a bit too late. Powerful rainbow explosions coursed through each vehicle, wrecking them completely and lessening the pressure on the honor guard.
Inside the Raphael’s cockpit, Lord Javier started to sweat profusely. Pushing the Raphael to enact resonance imposed a significant burden to his mind. Advanced mech pilots lacked the mental strength to elicit resonance from their mechs. Even if fake resonance was a pale imitation of the real thing, Javier’s mind became increasingly strained as the battle went on. Yet he never thought about stopping.
He was having the time of his life. He felt as if he was made to fight this battle. "Come, Vandals! Show me your best! Where are your champions?! I want a challenge!"
"If it’s a challenge you want, then here I am!"
A spear stabbed towards the Raphael, causing it to interrupt its targeting of the hovertanks. It fired a quick shell at the mech that drove forth the spear, only for the Vandal mech to sidestep the attack in the nick of time.
The Raphael’s sword entangled the spear and barely managed to redirected it away from its frame, though the spear still managed to scrape against its arm.
Captain Orfan’s looted spearman mech pulled back the spear and brandished it towards the Raphael. "Your playtime is over kid!"
Reinforcements from both sides tried to reach the ensuing battle that could very well decide the fate of Detemen IV. Every member of the household guards knew that Count Loqer valued Lord Javier above all else. If it wasn’t for the traditions that tied down his power, he would have allocated much more troops to guard his only offspring.
The consequences of failure was unimaginable. In the strong hierarchical culture of the Vesians, mech pilots under the service of a House carried a lot of responsibility. Failure to safeguard the lives of their charges often led to imprisonment or execution to those who failed to do their duties.
Yet as much as they tried to reinforce their liege, the battles they fought in the previous days had sapped much of their strength. Even now, many Vandal mechs spread out in Neron City tried to drag on their heels and force them to stop.
"Rescue the Lord!"
"Rescue the Lord!"
Many of the Vesian mechs that survived up to now consisted of second-line and law enforcement units. They weren’t equipped for a full-scale war and their mech pilots found it hard to match the skill of the Vandal mechs that harried their footsteps.
Aerial mechs also started to emerge in the skies. With the exposure of most anti-air turrets in Neron City, the Vandal forces made good progress into clearing them all out. Much of the hidden turrets that remained belonged to mercenaries and other private forces. They would never dare to fire them at the Vandals for fear of attracting their wrath.
This basically led to a wild battle in the skies where the Vandal Aerial forces continued to harass the Vesian forces spread out in the city. Sometimes, aerial mechs from both sides clashed high up in the air, though the Vandals slowly managed to gain an edge due to their better skill.
As for the underground rebel base, a lot of rebels stayed behind to support their comrades. The Detemen League held numerous strategic positions in Neron City and assisted the Vandals in slowing down the enemy from reinforcing Lord Javier.
"It’s getting increasingly harder to stop the household troops." Addy said. "They are too persistent in trying to reach their Lord. Our auxiliary troops aren’t meant to battle mechs head-on, and your Vandals are too spread out to slow down larger concentrations of mechs."
"Do the best you can." Ves replied. "The battle at the former recycling plant won’t end so soon."
"Can’t you do anything to help?"
"I’ve already relayed my analyses on the mechs piloted by Lord Javier and his honor guard. I can’t determine much more than that because these are very polished mechs."
Ves felt a bit useless at this stage. He only managed to figure out the basic specs and some tentative weak points for each mech model. None of them were easy to deal with, and only the rifleman mechs could be taken out quickly if they became exposed to concentrated fire.
The real threat came from the tiger mechs and the Loquacious Raphael. The former proved to be an adept prowler in the ruins. They took full advantage of their ability to navigate the ruinous terrain in order to flank the Vandals.
As for the Raphael, the hero mech proved its valiance with each mech or hovertank it managed to fell. However, this time it met its match when Captain Orfan tried to run interference on its rampage.
"The righteous won’t be stopped! Twin Star Slash!"
The Vandal spearman mech deftly blocked the predictable sequence of slashes with its spear and sent out a counter-attack right after. The Raphael quickly brandished its rifle and fired another shell to force Captain Orfan back.
"Why don’t you look into the mirror to find a villain!" She yelled out as she went back on the offensive. Her spearman mech stabbed forth in a flurry of blows that forced the Raphael to back off. "A monster to his own people doesn’t deserve to take on the mantle of a hero!"
Lord Javier wordlessly growled back. His eloquence deteriorated over the course of their impromptu duel. The captain was twice as hard to deal with compared to his previous opponents. Despite not carrying a shield, Captain Orfan abused the reach of her spear to interrupt his powerful combo attacks.
"You won’t take me down that easily! Twin Star Helix!" He yelled as his mech unleashed one of its signature attacks.
Its rotating sword clanged against the shaft of the spear and got pushed to the side. The Raphael had to fire another shell in order to stop the spearman mech from following through.
On and on the two mechs tried to gain the advantage. While Captain Orfan possessed just as much skill, she also benefited from a much richer battle experience than her opponent. She employed her rich bag of tricks to unsettle Javier and throw him off balance.
Sadly, none of her attacks managed to deal more than a scratch on the Raphael. While it was clearly geared towards offense, its excellent armor system enabled Lord Javier to take risks he ordinarily couldn’t afford to take. It withstood many blows that would have crippled many other mechs.
Ves studied the performance of the armor system in detail. The more he witnessed its incredible resilience, the more he felt he was out of his depth. "I’m not familiar with this type of armor. It’s too effective!"
"Is the Raphael invincible?" Addy asked in a worried tone.
"No mech is invincible. Not even the machines piloted by god pilots can make this kind of claim. There’s definitely a way to dismantle its armor. We just have to figure it out."
Ves always kept an eye on the Raphael since the start of the battle. Ves studied its armor carefully and noted that it did particularly well against all types of damage, fom lasers to bladed weapons. The armor system appeared capable of resisting all conventional damage types without compromising anything.
Yet Ves still clung to the belief that its amazing performance hinged on a secret or two. Once he figured it out, Lord Javier wouldn’t be so cocky anymore.
"It’s too difficult." He whispered. He stared hard at the Raphael and attempted to connect to it in the imaginary realm. He never attempted such an act before, but he was grasping at straws at this point.
Surprisingly, distance mattered surprisingly little when it came to such probes. It was enough to look at the Raphael from a projection. The powerful and vivid depiction of its duel against Captain Orfan’s mech allowed Ves to pinpoint its location with perfect accuracy. Just as his mental probe brushed against the Raphael, something happened.
"AHH!!"
Ves jerked back and held his head in pain. Something powerful and foreign rejected his mental probe.
"What happened?!" Addy asked as she placed a hand on his head.
"I’m fine, I’m fine! It’s just an accident."
He nursed his head as his mentality tried to recover back to normal. The probe had utterly and completely failed to make a dent. Why did the mech reject his mental approach?
Ves tried to parse the flavors he tasted at the moment of contact. Between pride, confidence and belief, Ves thought he touched upon something more than the simple concepts that Mr. Reeve unconsciously bestowed on his custom work. It felt... greater, and inviolable.
"It’s like I touched upon the mind of a human being!"
No, that didn’t sound accurate to him. Perhaps he brushed against something more than a single mech or human being. A suspicion began to grow within his mind.
"Is this the strength of a human mind and mech working in unison?"
The mental construct from their combination felt surprisingly powerful. It contained the purity and rigidity of a mech, and combined it with the spark of life and intelligence of a human being.
From the Raphael’s continued struggles against the spearman mech, Lord Javier probably hadn’t felt a thing from his attempted intrusion.
"Okay, esoteric mind voodoo doesn’t work either."
A mech designer couldn’t work miracles. Ves guessed that someone like Alloc or the other Journeymen attached to the Vandals wouldn’t have much luck either. The Loquacious Raphael was really something else.
Captain Orfan’s spearman mech started to become increasingly more ragged in its defense. The mech she appropriated from the Dastardly Handsome Bastards might be one of their better mechs, but she felt regretful about the fact that it wasn’t a military-grade mech. It came with several shortcomings and differences in configuration that made it hard for her to draw out its full strength.
"Is your mech getting tired? Do you want to take a break?" Lord Javier asked with mock sincerity. His mech was still going strong.
"I will keep you here until the end of time if possible!"
Not a lot of mech pilots among the Vandals could match Captain Orfan’s skill. She knew that if she pulled away from this duel, the Loquacious Raphael would go back to slaughtering the weaker Vandal mechs and hovertanks.
"Haha! Don’t lie to me! You’re at the end of your rope! Finishing move! Twin Star Extinction Comet!"
Captain Orfan hadn’t witnessed this move before. Expecting a heavy blow, her mech pulled back its spear and gripped it tightly in anticipation for a block.
Instead, the Raphael’s rifle arm glowed extremely bright. Just as Captain Orfan’s eyes widened and commanded her mech to dodge, the Raphael fired a spread of five radiant shells. Just before they reached her spearman mech, they exploded, buffeting her mech with multiple shockwaves.
Through the fading blasts of the explosions, the Raphael emerged from behind and stabbed its sword downwards while firing off the final shell in the magazine of its rifle.
The shell exploded against the spearman mech’s chest armor, which lost most of its layers already from suffering multiple blasts. Captain Orfan couldn’t afford to think about that though as her mech hastily parried the plunging attack.
Unfortunately, the force behind the Raphael’s attack and the previous shelling had destabilized the spearman mech’s footing. No matter her skill in piloting mechs, Captain Orfan couldn’t go against the laws of physics. Her mech helplessly fell onto its back, exposing it to the Raphael’s finishing move.
"Get away from the captain!"
The Vandals had rearranged their formation in the choke point and brought a couple of rifleman mechs forward. They fired at the Raphael in front of them with no regard to trigger discipline. Nonetheless, their accuracy and familiarity with their weapons allowed them to concentrate their fore on the Raphael’s weapon arms.
Javier scowled as he urged his Raphael to retreat back to cover. "I may have let you off today, but I’ll finish you myself after I deal with these insects!"
The Raphael might appear impervious to ranged damage, but Lord Javier always acted prudently and sought for cover before his mech could take much of a beating. He also needed to reload his rifle.
The Vandals took no notice of his words. Instead, a pair of melee mechs surged forth and dragged the downed spearman mech with their powerful arms. They couldn’t afford to lose Captain Orfan or her mech, as she was the only Vandal so far to last against the Raphael’s offensive.
"This is getting nowhere!" Addy slammed her fist against a console in frustration. The lack of progress in capturing or killing Lord Javier gnawed at everyone. "Neither their ranged mechs nor their tiger mechs are downed! What is this? We outnumber them!"
"We’re losing our numbers advantage." Ves noted from his seat. "Don’t forget how many mechs and hovertanks they’ve taken out. Our Vandal mechs and your hovertanks aren’t equipped to take out an elite force of mechs, especially in bad terrain like this."
Though the hovertanks managed to pepper the honor guard mechs from a distance, their relative fragility allowed the Vesian ranged mechs to take them out rather easily. It only took a handful of hits to destroy them. Therefore, Commander Breskin ordered most hovertanks to retreat after suffering one or two direct hits.
"I think we have to make some sacrifices." Addy concluded. She flickered through various ideas in her mind.
The battle between the two sides went badly for the Vandals and the rebels. They lost a third of their total forces without downing a single enemy mech. The disparity in mech quality proved to be the decisive factor keeping Lord Javier aloft.
While the Loquacious Raphael attracted a lot of attention and firepower, its excellent armor and generous energy reserves allowed the mech to sustain itself in battle without declining in performance. Constantine Reeve deliberately designed the Raphael as a hero mech that uplifted its allies through perseverance.
Ves understood the Senior Mech Designer’s intentions. "The Raphael leads by example. It excels in chaotic battlefields and lengthy campaigns. Its dependence on a sword and a ballistic rifle allows it to ration its energy consumption and relegate heat management to a distant concern."
As a mech designer whose only original designs echoed similar principles, Ves appreciated Mr. Reeve’s design choices for the Raphael.
Much like the Blackbeak and the Crystal Lord, the Raphael could keep on fighting for a very long time.
Unlike the two regular designs, the highly advanced Raphael enjoyed some of the best designs and materials the Vesia Kingdom had to offer. This enabled the mech’s performance curve to stay at a very high base level, to the point where it wouldn’t lose out to peak-performance mechs meant to unleash all of their might in a brief interval.
"This is the power of money."
When it came to mechs, you often got what you paid for. While mech buyers did often purchase a premium based on subjective qualities such as brand and current trends, every mech charged a price based on the quality of its materials and the quality of their designs.
This was bad news for the Vandals that clashed head-on against the Raphael, because none of their looted or refurbished Vesian mechs appeared to be premium mechs. Ves loosely estimated that the average value of their mechs didn’t surpass 30 million credits.
Though their robust training and inclusion of some military-grade technologies narrowed the gap, it still left a wide gulf between the Vandals and the Raphael.
Nonetheless, the story was slightly different with the honor guard mechs. Though they lasted for an admirable amount of time, they hadn’t been built to withstand long sieges.
Ves recognized that they’d been designed by someone else, and had been tasked with meeting very different criteria.
What was a honor guard mech?
"They need to guard their charges from sudden threats."
These threats often approached covertly and sprung their attack within a split-second. This was why the honor guard mechs all possessed excellent close-ranged sensors. Right now, the honor guard mechs utilized this trait to their advantage by forestalling every flanking attempts made by the Vandals.
Pervasive jamming along with all the interference released in the air from the meteorite impacts reduced the reliability of sensors in the vicinity. Even the observation bugs that relayed live footage of the battle to the rebel base glitched out or lagged a number of times.
The cheaper Vesian-built mechs piloted by the Vandals would sometimes be as blind as a bat, and needed to rely on those same observation bugs to pin down the locations of their adversaries. This took too much time, and the enemy often responded well before the Vandals completed their latest maneuvers.
The second advantage turned out to be a double-edged sword for the honor guard mechs. Designed to fend off assassin mechs as quickly as possible, their performance curve was a lot steeper. They could deliver a formidable amount of combat power in the first twenty minutes or so of combat.
This served them well as they miraculously avoided any losses so far. While a few honor guard mechs got beaten up a bit, none of them lost any major functionality.
However, their energy reserves obviously expended at a much faster rate, or better said, they didn’t possess as much reserves as the Raphael. In ten minutes or less, they would quickly run out of steam.
The only problem was that they might taken a dozen or more Vandal mechs out of the equation in the meantime. Therefore, the attackers couldn’t afford to drag out the fight until the honor guard mechs exhausted themselves.
"Reinforcements are also on the way."
Overall, fewer Vesian mechs remained in Neron City, yet the ones that lasted up until now still fought on their home ground. They utilized secret tunnels and other means to rapidly convey themselves across the battlefield. The first wave of reinforcements shouldn’t take much more than five minutes to arrive.
The Loquacious Raphael and the honor guard mechs needed to be taken care of by that time, or else the attackers had to divide their attention on two fronts.
"Are you certain the Raphael has expended most of its ammunition?" Addy carefully asked Ves in the rebel base.
Ves nodded with confidence. "I’ve counted every shot. From the size of the magazines, to the diameter of the muzzle, I’ve made a pretty good estimate on how many shells the Raphael is carrying. His backpack module is a smaller and lighter variant, which prevents it from being a hindrance to the custom mech, but it also limits the amount of magazines it can store."
And now that the artificial meteorites crumbled all the tunnels and weapon caches, the Raphael wouldn’t be able to replenish its supplies anywhere.
The plan Addy proposed sounded fairly risky, as they only had a single shot to make it happen. If the sacrifices failed to achieve the desired effect, then Lord Javier and his escorts might even be able to turn the battle around.
They could not let him get away!
Ves, Addy and the rest only spent a brief minute to refine their proposal before she contacted Commander Breskin and filled him in. Time was of the essence so they needed to make a quick decision.
The rebel leader responded in a decisive tone. "We’ll do it. Help coordinate the hovertanks. Their trajectories need to be precise."
Both the mobile command center near the field of battle and the underground base worked in unison to prepare the hovertanks. After another minute of preparation, they readied every element for this plan.
A silent countdown reached its mark. Breskin immediately slammed a button. "Execute!"
The mobile command center sent a signal to the seventeen or so hovertanks that still remained aloft. The signal activated the autopilot of the tanks, causing them to thrust forward at their maximum acceleration. They moved forth so fast that their hulls even started heating up.
Anyone familiar with hovertanks could see that they exceeded their maximum safe capacity. If this went on for more than a couple of minutes, the tanks would eventually melt down or explode. In any case, the damage it already sustained had already ruined the vehicles.
Down at the ruined section of Neron City, the Flagrant Vandals valiantly persisted in fighting against the Raphael and its escorts. They even managed to cripple one of the tiger mech’s forelimbs, causing its mobility and offensive ability to be truncated by a significant margin.
"We can do it! Just hold on!" Captain Orfan urged in her heavily-damaged spearman mech. She had just been filled in on the plan and approved of it wholeheartedly. "Kenneth, switch with Jessie, she won’t hold out much longer against the bastard!"
A very frayed skirmisher mech retreated against the Raphael, allowing a sturdy knight to take its place. It was the last intact knight that the Vandals could bring to bear at this time. They had kept their precious knight mech in reserve until now.
The movements of the hovertanks couldn’t be hidden from anyone. The Raphael simultaneously parried a sword strike with its own sword while bringing its rifle to its back to deposit another magazine. Alarms blared inside the cockpit of the elite mech as its advanced systems detected a dangerous shift in movement from the hovertanks.
Lord Javier took a quick glance at their trajectories and their acceleration profile to recognize their intent. "Kamikaze attacks! You dishonorable dogs!"
A hovertank may be lighter than other forms of tanks, but they didn’t lose out compared to aerial mechs and light mechs. They possessed a significant amount of mass and carried a substantial amount of momentum after building up a respectable amount of speed.
Now that every crewmember evacuated from the vehicles, the autopilot accelerated the war machines forward with reckless abandon. They could cross the distance in less a short span of time and impact the Raphael with power surpassing that of a heavy cannon attack.
"Guards, attend to me! Ranged mechs, shoot down the hovertanks!"
The honor guard tried to shift away to assist their liege, but the Vandals redoubled their offensive, causing most of them to be pinned in place. The ranged mechs were torn between aiding their comrades and shooting down the incoming hovertanks, and eventually decided to address the latter. They couldn’t disobey a direct order from their Lord.
"Pressure them! Supress them! Don’t let them up!" Captain Orfan yelled and joined the fray even though her spearman mech’s chest exhibited a huge hole.
A single solid hit on the chest would ruin the mech entirely, and could even end her life. Nonetheless, her devotion to the Vandals and her determination to complete the mission pushed her forward. Not a single Vandal mech remained idle during the execution of the plan.
Lord Javier saw that things proceeded badly for his side. The ranged mechs under his command tried their best to shoot down the hovertanks, and while they did manage to score some lucky hits that caused the hovertanks to faulter or explode, too many vehicles still pressed forth.
The noble’s brow started to sweat profusely. Just like Ves, Lord Javier had been keeping track of his ammunition reserves as well. His mech only carried a couple more magazines. Once the Loquacious Raphael ran out of ammunition, it lost more than half its effective combat strength.
"I don’t have a choice!"
The well-born man gritted his teeth and charged his resonance. The Raphael’s rifle arm glowed in a majestic rainbow colors, yet it looked a little less stable than usual.
"No matter how much attacks you throw at us, House Eneqqin endures!" He broadcasted while trying to split his attention between fending off the persistent Vandal knight mech and maintaining his resonance with his mech. "Even if we fall, my father will take vengeance for me! Ultimate move: Exalted Rainbow Storm!"
The Raphael fired its rifle almost fully automatic. The quick succession of shots practically drained the rifle’s magazine. Each of the powerful rainbow shells impacted a hovertank without fail.
As much as the hovertanks tried to make itself a difficult target, its extreme acceleration made it difficult for them to follow an evasive pattern. Half of the shells hit dead center against the nose of the hovertanks.
All of the vehicles that got hit turned into fireballs or sustained so much damage that they failed to remain aloft. Wreckage and pieces of debris rained down ruined ground of Neron City, but more of the tanks still closed in on the Raphael.
The elite mech reloaded its rifle in record time and fired at the hovertanks yet again. This time, it didn’t have the luxury to wait until its resonance charged up. It emptied its rifle of shells without taking sufficient time to aim.
A few more hovertanks got taken out, but six more made it through.
Seconds away from impact, Lord Javier started to panic. His backpack module just deposited its last magazine in its rifle. With the hovertanks in spitting distance to his mech, he shot his last burst, causing three of the hovertanks to fall short of their goal.
Only three remained, and Javier could not think of anything else except to brace for impact. Moments before the hovertanks impacted the mech, it threw away its spent rifle and detached the backpack module from its back. Its free hand grabbed the backpack and gripped it as an improvised shield.
Naturally, Javier didn’t think of enduring the collisions head on. He tried to move his mech out of the way for a dodge, only to get halted by Kenneth’s knight mech.
At the final second, the noble had neglected his struggle against the Vandal knight mech. The mech dropped its sword and shield and took on the Raphael’s sword strike head on, causing it to deliver an awful hack against its chest armor.
Kenneth ignored the damage to his mech and controlled it to reach forth with its arms until it held onto the Raphael’s sword arm.
"You crazy Brighter! Let loose!"
It was too late! The hovertanks reached their destination and impacted square against the Raphael in quick succesion!
The Detemen League that rebelled against their rightful overlords never intended to free their home planet from the greedy nobles that exploited it dry. They wanted to make a statement that would shock the entire Kingdom, and to accomplish this, they intended to tear down the depraved heir that ruled over Detemen IV.
They never intended to stick around after initiating the riots. When the Vesian reinforcements came in force and started to scour the planet, most of their hideouts would doubtlessly be found. Instead, they already prepared to escape in space and rely on the Vesian Revolutionary Front to shelter them far away from their homes.
Since they only prepared a limited amount of ships, they couldn’t bring everything they owned with them. The ships would only be enough to carry their core members along with some basic supplies and trade goods that they intended to barter for survival in the stars.
As much as they wanted to bring along the hovertanks and other vehicles, they simply didn’t have the space to accommodate them all. The local rebels never valued them too much for this reason.
Letting them serve a use by driving them into the Loquacious Raphael was already generous enough.
In the aftermath of the collisions and subsequent self-destruction of the hovertanks, everyone tried to scan through the dust and interference. As the smoke and debris drifted away, the spectators came across an astonishing sight.
"The Raphael still stands!"
The mech lost its rifle arm, and its other limbs sustained moderate damage as well. Its chest looked mostly intact, but a handful of deformities left behind a couple of rents in its armor coverage.
Though the Vandals and the rebels felt disappointed that the Raphael survived the succession of collisions, it at least managed to create a handful of weak points on the mech. The rents in the chest armor and the exposed socket that formerly connected to the rifle arm both represented major vulnerabilities.
Captain Orfan grinned as she witnessed the damage through her damaged spearman mech’s sensors. "What are you waiting for, men? We cracked it open! Finish it off!"
The Vandal mechs surged forth with renewed enthusiasm. The one thing they hated most about their opponent was that the Loquacious Raphael possessed a virtually impervious shell. None of their weapons managed to leave more than a shallow dent on its armor.
Yet the collisions changed everything. The sheer kinetic power behind the blows along with the subsequent explosions at point-blank range had finally managed to overwhelm the Raphael’s amazing armor system.
The Vandal mechs only needed to deal some damage through these openings to damage the Raphael’s much less resilient internals.
"We’ve got him on the ropes! Press on!"
The Raphael backed off continuously as its damaged and unbalanced state couldn’t keep it at a stable footing. Mechs poured into the bottleneck and physically pushed every mech in a line along until the Raphael finally got pushed out of the narrow corridor it used as a bottleneck.
The Vandal mech pilots cheered as they entered a small clearing where they had much more room to maneuver. Some of the honor guard mechs finally managed to shrug off their opponents and repositioned themselves to back the Raphael up.
"Do you think we’re finished? Hah! Think again!" Lord Javier broadcasted. "Ridding me of my rifle only allows me to concentrate on my swordplay!"
Just as the Vandals moved to deliver the coup de grace, the Raphael turned into a nimble fencer. Lord Javier completely disregarded the absence of one of its arms and put his full attention on retaliating against his opponents.
Kenneth’s knight mech was the first to go down. The Vandal mech pilot had become a little complacent after witnessing the damaged state of the Raphael. However, he completely misjudged the damaged mech’s state.
Far from being crippled, the Raphael still retained much of its strength. Besides missing its rifle, it still proved to be a deadly mech up close. After exchanging a couple of blows with the Vandal knight mech, the Raphael surged its legs forth and flanked the knight mech before stabbing its sword into its lower back.
The Raphael’s sword arm pushed its sword through the rear armor of the knight mech and punctured its engine. This instantly caused the knight to lose its motive power and freeze in place.
Lord Javier huffed in frustration as he controlled his mech to pull out its sword and turn around to parry another sword strike. He felt frustrated at being unable to finish off the knight mech.
Moments later, Kenneth ejected from the immobilized knight mech. With its engine out of operation, he would only be a target for the Vesian mechs that stubbornly kept up the fight.
"These guys just won’t give up." Addy muttered in the rebel base.
Around them, the rebels started packing up their gear and supplies. The Detemen League expended all of their hovertanks in Neron City while their infantry couldn’t contend against the power of elite mechs. Commander Breskin already retreated from the battlefield and ordered the rebels to evacuate their base in advance.
"Is it alright to move out when the fight isn’t over?" Ves carefully asked.
Addie smirked at him. "Your worries are unfounded, Mr. Larkinson. The fight is already over. What we’re witnessing is the death throes of a delusional brat who doesn’t know the game is up."
Pretty much every rebel believed the fight would soon be over. Though the Loquacious Raphael put up a valiant fight, its vulnerable state meant that it was only a matter of time before a Vandal dealt a lucky hit. Even with the absence of long-ranged fire support from the hovertanks, the Vandals all believed that victory was near.
Captain Orfan smelled blood. She turned her damaged mech away from the rampaging Raphael and assisted a handful of other mechs in taking down the tiger mechs. Besides Lord Javier’s mech, the tiger mechs inflicted the most damage to their forces.
Though they performed well in confined spaces, they lost none of their power when they fight in slightly more open terrain. They constantly circled around, building up speed for a powerful charge that could knock down any humanoid mech in their way.
A handful of Vandals braced their mechs too late, causing the tiger mechs to shove them onto their backs. Once they fell prone onto the ground, the tiger mechs savaged them with their claws or bit off their limbs with their powerful jaws.
One mech got demolished entirely, while the other two made it off with heavy damage after some of the Vandal ranged mechs forced the tiger mechs to back away.
Still, these mechs had already accumulated a lot of damage. The constant laser beams and shells that impacted against their thick armor started to chip away at their integrity.
Captain Orfan recognized their vulnerable state and pounced forth. Two Vandal light mechs at her sides supported her offensive and darted ahead to occupy their target. The tiger mech desperately swung its paws to smack aside their attacks, but this was where one of their inherent weaknesses expressed itself.
Ves witnessed it all through the live feeds that continued to be relayed to the base even as it slowly emptied out. He nodded at the tiger mech’s frantic state.
"One of the biggest reasons why the bestial supremacy movement failed to convince the galaxy to switch over entirely is because these animal shapes lack too much versatility."
Versatility meant many things. In the context of bestial mechs, they lacked this strength in two key aspects.
First, their rejection of articulated limbs meant that they would be stuck with a single loadout. They wouldn’t be able to change their weapon types at all.
Many humanoid mech pilots loved the fact that they could change between different models of weapons whenever they wanted without any compatibility issues. This did not mean that a mech designed to wield swords would be able to wield spears with the same level of performance.
Merely having the ability to use different swords was enough of an advantage. In one deployment, they might want to use a short sword, in case they fought in confined spaces. In another deployment, they might wish to switch to a long and hefty two-handed sword for maximum reach and leverage.
Bestial mechs didn’t possess that sort of luxury. For tiger mechs, even exchanging their claws for a different model was a huge pain, because it wouldn’t be a given that the newer model would pair up as well with the limbs.
"Another area their versatility falls short is their shortcoming in defense."
Most bestial mechs fared well in a single mode of combat, and most of the time this consisted of offensive attacks. For example, most felinid mechs excelled in pouncing on their targets, which the tiger mechs of the honor guard had pulled off successfully multiple times.
Yet when it came to fending off attacks, the limited range of motion of their limbs revealed their deficiency in this area. The tiger mech in question currently faced the harassment of two flanking light skirmishers, but already it fell into a tough situation as its limbs flailed around with dubious effectiveness.
At that moment, the tiger mech fell under so much pressure that its mech pilot unconsciously disregarded the heavily wounded spearman mech piloted by Captain Orfan.
Big mistake.
"Perish!"
The captain’s mech charged forward and slammed the tip of its spear into the head of the tiger mech, piercing through and dealing catastrophic damage to the entire appendage. The honor guard mech reared back in shock, but the Vandal skirmisher mechs took the opportunity to close in and deliver deep stabs into its abdomen.
If the tiger mech was still in peak condition, it would have been able to shrug of these attacks and even deliver a counterattack with its intact claws. Yet the tiger mech jerked a bit as previous battle damage hampered its previously smooth movements.
Captain Orfan waited for this moment. Her mech janked out its spear and jabbed it forward, pushing the spear straight into the exposed neck and jamming the tip through the softer internals.
The tiger mech tried to shake off the spear, but it was too late. The spearman mech possessed enough power to continue to push through the neck until it hit the power reactor.
The bestial mech lasted for an admirable amount of time, but even it couldn’t persist without a working power reactor.
The Vandals finally downed the first honor guard mech!
"One down, eight more to go!"
The downing of the tiger mech delivered a firm impact on the remaining honor guard pilots. Far from losing heart, they only grew more fanatical in their mission to safeguard their liege. They fought on twice as ferociously, but this only accelerated their eventual downfall.
With Captain Orfan taking the initiative, she helped down all the other tiger mechs. Other Vandals freed up from these takedowns proceeded to gang up on the honor guard that remained.
One by one they fell, until Lord Javier lost all of his guards.
The Loquacious Raphael was the last mech standing. A semi-circle of Vandal mechs stood opposite of its dirtied and damaged form. There was nothing left of its formerly pristine heroic form. If anything, it looked as ragged as a beggar.
Even then, Lord Javier lost none of his heroic bearing. The Loquacious Raphael maintained a straight-backed posture as it pointed its sword against the Vandal mechs arrayed against it like a knight sworn to fight to the death.
"It’s over, Javier." Captain Orfan spoke with a tired voice as her mech stepped forth with its spear at the ready. "Your guards have put up a good fight, but the outcome was never in doubt. You’re outnumbered and your mech won’t hold up for long. Do the sensible thing and surrender."
The Raphael swept its head from side to side, as if it was contemplating its chances.
"You’re wrong, Brighter."
"How so?"
"My mech. It’s not at the end of its rope!"
Before anyone could process Javier’s words, the eyes of the mech started to glow in red and gold.
"TWIN SUPERNOVA RELEASE!"
One mech. Around twenty opponents. The Loquacious Raphael appeared to be on its last legs. The suicide attacks from the hovertanks rent apart its rifle arm while exposing various sections of its frontal armor to the elements.
No matter how well the armor system could hold out, it couldn’t do anything about the exposed areas.
Nonetheless, at the end of its lifespan, the Raphael’s entire frame glowed like a star about to explode. The mechs of the Flagrant Vandals all put up their guard as soon as Lord Javier yelled out those strange words.
"Twin Supernova Release? What does that mean?" Addy asked back in the rebel base.
Ves interpreted the sensor readings in rapid tempo. He quickly deduced that the Raphael’s core heated up from two distinct spots. Once he realized what that represented, his eyes widened in shock.
"The Loquacious Raphael possesses two smaller power reactors instead of a single larger one!"
"What’s the significance of that?!"
"It means it can run through a lot more power in an instant, though the heat build-up will be ruinous! At these power levels, the Raphael can’t last more than three minutes!"
The artificial limiters that shackled the power reactors broke upon the command. With this irreversible, Lord Javier decisively chose to burn out the entire potential lifespan of his precious mech in a matter of minutes.
"My steed, lend me your strength! Let our final battle together be as magnificent as the death of stars!"
The mech glowed hot from more than heat. Some sort of unknown red-orange energy field coated the surface of the mech, including its damaged portions. It gave out the illusion that the mech was burning.
"Don’t listen to his melodramatic nonsense!" Captain Orfan tried to sober up her mech pilots. "Ranged mechs, open fire! Melee mechs, prepare to intercept the Raphael!"
A storm of lasers and projectiles slammed into the Raphael, but just as they reached the energy field, it exploded. This prematurely set off the explosive shells and hindered the kinetic projectiles and laser beams from hitting the Raphael itself.
"What is this, some kind of energy screen?!"
"I don’t believe it can sustain itself forever! Keep firing!"
No matter how much firepower the Vandal mechs threw at the overloading mech, none of their efforts bore fruit. The energy field acted like a reactive defense to the custom mech, halting any incoming attacks through sheer violence.
"Mr. Larkinson! Figure out that energy field!" Addy yelled at him.
"It can’t be cracked by weak attacks, no matter how many it endures! It can only be penetrated by one strong attack!"
"Is there any other weakness?"
"As I said, the Loquacious Raphael can’t possibly sustain this energy field forever. Why not wait it out?"
Unfortunately, Lord Javier didn’t intend to waste this moment. His overloaded mech surged forward with its powerful legs, which stirred up soil and debris as it raced towards the nearest Vandal mechs.
"Block him!"
A handful of melee mechs moved to intercept the approaching Raphael, yet the elite mech arrived within range before they could finish their adjustments.
"Weaklings! Get out of my way!"
The Raphael avoided the twin daggers of a skirmisher mech and spun forward, allowing it’s glowing sword to slam against the side of the light mech with the flat of the blade.
BANG!
By striking with the flat of its sword, the Raphael maximized the contact surface of the energy field surrounding the weapon. Upon contact with the sides of the skirmisher mech, the surface of the energy field exploded with extreme violence! A quarter of the light mech’s mass practically disintegrated from the blast!
The Raphael’s decision to attack the light mech left the swordsman mech next to it free to attack the berserking mech. With a powerful two-handed chop, the swordsman mech attempted to bisect its target starting with the head.
However, just as the sword made contact with the top of the energy field, it exploded with a smaller but energetic blast that pushed the sword off-course. This unanticipated reaction caused the swordsman mech to become unbalanced.
"My mech is invincible! No attack shall ever sully it, especially from unworthy scum like you!"
Lord Javier’s reaction time sped up along with the comprehensive enhancement of the Raphael. His mech utilized the blast that destroyed the light mech to swing its weapon towards the vulnerable swordsman mech.
Though the Vandal pilot only needed half a second to recover from his mistake, Javier wouldn’t let his opponent off! The sword swung with the edge first, and upon contact with the arm, the subsequent explosion sprung forth in a narrow line that almost sliced the swordsman mech’s torso in half!
"Butchers of Detemen IV! Justice is at hand! None shall escape our wrath!"
"Hold him off! Don’t let him approach our ranged mechs!"
It was too late! The Vandals came with greater numbers, but they spread themselves out in an attempt to surround the Raphael in case it ran away. They never anticipated that Javier would storm their formation. Now, their melee mechs needed to close the distance in order to cover for their ranged mechs, but no matter how fast they ran, they couldn’t overtake the Raphael in overdrive!
A trio of explosions rang out in the clearing as the Raphael swung its sword in three quick slashes. Just a light graze was enough for the energy field that enveloped its sword to explode, crumbling the fragile rifleman mechs that attempted to flee.
None of the mechs survived, and two of their pilots even perished when the explosion breached the containment of their cockpits!
The Raphael proceeded to turn around and chase after the other ranged mechs. Though the latter enjoyed a head start, the Vandal mechs had ultimately been optimized to run a marathon. Against a sprinter doped with destructive stimulants, the Raphael easily overtook the scrambling mechs and downed them one by one with explosive stabs directed against their flimsy rear armor.
Captain Orfan shouted various commands to her surviving subordinates. She attempted to surround the Raphael to force it into a defensive posture, but the burning mech moved too quickly to let itself be cornered.
In an attempt to turn the tide herself, Orfan dragged her damaged mech into the Raphael’s path and stabbed forth with its spear.
"Weakling! Stay down where you belong! Twin Supernova Slash!"
The Raphael accelerated for a tiny instant, allowing it to dodge the spear that attempted to impale its front. The mech swung its sword in a succession of rapid slashes that barely grazed the surface of Captain Orfan’s mech.
Yet with each hit, the exploding energy field caused the mech to fall apart.
The first slash blew off its arms, causing the spearman mech to drop its precious weapon.
The second slash hit its abdomen, causing much of the armor at that section to be stripped off in an instant.
The third slash sliced off the head, which momentarily blinded Captain Orfan’s mech.
The fourth slash slammed through the neck and into the exposed upper chest, destabilizing the mech’s power reactor.
The fifth slash swung upwards on the same trajectory but deeper, allowing the sword to slam into the cockpit.
"This is your end!"
Luckily enough, Orfan realized her precarious situation beforehand. Just after the first slash landed on her mech, she already punched the eject button. Her cockpit launched out of the back of her doomed mech just before the fifth slash hit home.
Lacking its rifle, the Loquacious Raphael helplessly witnessed the Vandal captain disappear. "Tch! Scaredy Cat!"
Lord Javier released his frustrations on the Vandals mechs that remained functional. "None of you will get away!"
The takedown of Captain Orfan’s mech caused the Vandals to waver. The loss of their immediate superior also caused the Vandal mech pilots to lose their coordination. Though a mech lieutenant among their number attempted to take over the lead, the Raphael tore through their ranks too quickly for them to organize themselves.
It was like a fox in a henhouse! In just under two minutes, the Loquacious Raphael took down over twenty Vandal mechs!
Nobody could believe what had happened. Just as the Vandals and the rebels took out the honor guard mechs, Lord Javier’s last stand completely turned the final battle around!
This was a disaster for the attackers!
"Damnit! Addy slammed both of her fists against a command console. "The Raphael is on the move! He’s getting away! Intercept him!"
"With what?!" A rebel officer asked. "The Vandals lost all of their assets in the vicinity and we don’t have any vehicles left except for the mobile command center and the troop transports!"
Both of those vehicles wouldn’t last a second against the Loquacious Raphael, especially in its empowered state.
Addy gritted her teeth. Both she and Breskin wavered on the decision whether to pursue the fleeing mech. They might just be sending more men to their deaths if they did so.
Ves spoke up at that moment. "Don’t forget that the Raphael is already a total loss! It won’t last more than half a minute! I suggest you put your vehicles on pursuit, but keep them at a distance. Lord Javier’s mech will collapse sooner or later, and when that happens, get ready to intercept him or his ejecting cockpit!"
"You’re right!" Addy shook her head. "This is only a temporary state! There shouldn’t be any way that ridiculous mech can sustain this mode forever, or else it would have unleashed it at the start!"
"We are moving our forces in position, but we don’t have enough men and vehicles at hand to surround the entire perimeter!" Commander Breskin informed the base the command channel. "Send everyone you can spare and fan them out in hundred meter intervals in case Javier decides to eject! Ready our remaining portable anti-air assets as well!"
The rebel base was in the process of evacuating the premises, so they already readied most of their vehicles. With the change of plans, they abruptly switched gears. They dumped out most of their cargo from their transports in order to make space for any available man or woman.
The Raphael ran as far away as it could from the rebels, but the mech already showed signs of breaking down. Some of the sections of its twin power reactors began to melt down from the excess heat and energy that ran through its channels.
"A supernova is a star’s last hurrah." Ves quietly remarked. "Burning brighter than ever before and exploding with the fury that shakes the local cosmos, the death of one star will invigorate the life of other stars."
Supernovas happened all the time in the galaxy. With hundreds of billions of stars spinning around its core, it didn’t matter if their lifespan could be measured in eons. Stars burned as long as they possessed the right substances to burn. The moment they ran out of fuel, they transitioned into a wholly new shape, which sometimes led to an explosive bang.
"No matter how much Lord Javier stretches his Raphael, he can’t stave off the inevitable."
As a mech designer attached to the Flagrant Vandals, he was excused from joining the final chase. Even Addy moved out to lead a contingent of rebels. The only ones who remained were the elderly and the disabled rebels who took on the role of caretakers within the Detemen League.
Instead, he stayed behind and performed some additional analyses. From his hasty calculations, he predicted that the Raphael’s twin power reactors couldn’t be shut down anymore. Instead, the runaway reactions continued to build up, which only exacerbated the heat and energy build-up.
In short, the mech would soon explode with enough force to take out an entire city block.
"Don’t approach the Raphael! It’s going to blow soon!" Ves informed the rebels over the channel. "Anyone on foot should stand at least five-hundred meters away! Chances are high that Lord Javier will eject!"
Only a few seconds passed before his words came true. Lord Javier would never choose to go down with his mech. With only an instant to go before the power reactors reached a critical state, the rear armor of the Raphael blasted apart, opening up an avenue for its cockpit to blast off from the doomed mech.
A halo of rainbow enveloped the cockpit. Boosters at least twice as powerful as those attached to a regular cockpit pushed the boxy mass away from the doomed mech.
Just as Lord Javier’s cockpit cleared away, the Loquacious Raphael finally couldn’t hold it any longer.
Its twin reactor exploded in unison, which quickly blended into a massive explosion that wracked the ruined terrain another time.
Despite the glorious explosion happening in the vicinity, none of the rebels paid attention to the tragic sight of a hero mech’s end. Instead, they focused all of their efforts at taking down the cockpit traveling through the air.
"Fire the missiles!"
When the artificial meteorites fell, House Eneqqin unleashed all of its hidden anti-air batteries in Neron City. This enabled the rebels to locate them and neutralize them. The same couldn’t be said for the batteries erected by the rebels in secret.
Due to the need for utmost secrecy, the Detemen League only installed a limited amount of turrets in the city. Only a handful of batteries were in range of Lord Javier’s flying cockpit at this time.
Laser beams hit the cockpit in an instant, but surprisingly left no mark! The orange energy field enveloping the cockpit prevented any damage from going through!
Missiles soared into the sky after the laser beams puttered out. The rebels launched them out of the few mobile missile platforms in their possession. A larger number of shoulder-launched missiles fired by infantrymen followed suit.
Each of those missiles unerringly hit the cockpit that made no attempt to hide its presence. Even if it wished to deploy any stealth or ECM, the enormous amount of heat released by its boosters and energy field overpowered any attempts at covering it up.
"What does it take to down this cockpit?!" Addy screamed in frustration over the command channel.
"Don’t stop hitting it!" Ves urged the rebels. "The cockpit shouldn’t possess much of a reserve. It’s not as invincible as the Raphael when it was still intact!"
Regardless of his words, the rebels hated the man inside the cockpit so much that they never let up. More and more laser beams struck the energy field while missiles of varying payloads constantly tried to disturb its integrity.
It took some time, but the energy field eventually began to flicker. It had obviously reached the end of its reserves. Only a few more hits would tear apart the cockpit’s protective coverage.
"Hold your fire! Don’t put anymore missiles in the air!"
Missiles already in the air still slammed into the energy field, but no one launched another salvo. A handful of laser turrets continued to strike the cockpit unerringly. They chipped away at the remnants of the energy field until it finally winked out.
"The cockpit lost its protection! Take down its boosters! Be careful with it, we want him alive!"
The cockpit’s exterior was made out of lightweight but highly resilient compressed alloys. This eased the burden on the laser turrets as they accurately took out the vulnerable boosters and anti-grav modules.
With less and less components keeping the cockpit aloft, it slowly plunged towards the ground in a barely-controlled crash.
"Surround the crash site! Don’t leave any gaps exposed!"
Ves watched from his terminal as the rebel forces moved in position to surround the projected crash site. Some of their vehicles hurried to keep up with the plunging cockpit.
As the cockpit slammed into an abandoned street and slid forth for a short distance, Ves wondered whether this ordeal would finally be over. As much as he enjoyed being useful, he could have offered the same level of assistance in orbit.
"I’m not cut out for the battlefield."
Though he long shed his innocence, he still disliked being jerked around in places where he shouldn’t even be present. "I hope after this, the Flagrant Vandals will take a lengthy vacation."
Once the rebels brought Lord Javier under custody, the Vandals should have nothing left to tie them to this star system.
"There’s also their operation in Detemen II."
Though Ves thought that Detemen IV played a vastly more important role, Colonel Lowenfield opted to take charge of the detachment responsible for fulfilling their objectives on Detemen II. He found that to be a very odd decision. Why would the colonel pay so much attention to that smaller, more impoverished planet?
"The only thing of strategic value on that planet is their renewable exotics mine. Even then, it’s nothing remarkable. An endless stream of junk exotics isn’t anything to get crazy about."
The sad truth about third-rate states was that anything valuable got snatched away by the local hegemons. In the case of the Bright Republic and the Vesia Kingdom, the Friday Coalition often appropriated their treasures under a variety of excuses. Though compared to the Hexadric Hegemony, the Coalition partners at least had the decency to compensate for some of their losses.
The fact that neither the Coalition or the Hegemony snatched the renewable exotics mine from Detemen II should have hammered in the point that it didn’t hold too much value.
"Is it the solar foundries that they’re after?"
Ves tentatively rejected that possibility. The solar foundries carried the same worth as a large-scale manufacturing complex. They stored a lot of raw and processed materials, but their value was purely economic.
From the start, he always got the sense that the Vandals omitted many details in their operation. From their planning to their objectives, all of it seemed plausible enough to fool the rank and file.
To Ves, the more he witnessed the Vandals and rebels in action, the more he questioned their motives. Assaulting an industrial star system in the middle of an enemy state was almost never done, because most people had the sense to call it crazy.
Even now, at the cusp of success, they still had a long road ahead of them. "We’ve certainly riled up the entire Kingdom. Let alone Imodris, every other Vesian will be out for our blood."
No matter how he looked at the picture, the risks far outweighed the possible benefits. If the Flagrant Vandals wanted to earn some cash to alleviate their massive debts, they could have invaded an industrial system closer to the border. Imodris sat well past the border regions, and neighbored several other formidable Duchies within the Kingdom.
Getting out of this cordon would test the limits of their trust in the Vesian Revolutionary Front. The Kingdom-wide movement promised to extract the Vandals after they finished their operation, but Ves found it dubious to rely on the rebels to keep their word, especially since they came from opposing states.
"Do the Vandals and the VRF have something in common?"
That was the only theory he could come up with that made some sense, yet he couldn’t imagine what it looked like. Just because they shared a common enemy didn’t mean they were bosom buddies. At the very least, the Flagrant Vandals must have invested several decades into befriending the VRF.
"Or perhaps it’s the other way around."
Maybe the VRF saw the Vandals as a useful cudgel that they could point at their enemies to bludgeon their faces. They certainly did so now in an attempt to win the favor of the Detemen League.
By now, Lord Javier’s cockpit came to a stop. Several rebel vehicles flew forward and landed close to the cockpit. Lightly-armored infantrymen surrounded the cockpit with their weapons bared.
One of their cadre moved forward and approached the hatch. "Step out of the cockpit, Lordling! There’s nowhere else to go!"
Ten seconds passed by. The cockpit exhibited no activity at all. Its hot shell wafted steam and other matter as it slowly started to cool down.
Commander Breskin forestalled the call to surrender. "Forget about it. It’s not in Javier’s nature to concede on anything. Proceed with the breach."
Some of the rebel infantrymen approached the steaming cockpit and attached some sort of apparatus against the armored hatch. The device instantly started to burn. This went on for over thirty seconds.
Slowly, a rectangular man-sized hole appeared on the surface of the cockpit. A pair of soldiers grabbed onto the handholds of the apparatus and pulled the rectangular section of alloys away. Another pair of soldiers jumped inside the hole.
Seconds later, they conveyed an alarming piece of news.
"Lord Javier is absent!"
Ves and the commanding officers of the rebels patched into the sensor feed of the soldiers inside the cramped cockpit. They ignored the luxurious interior and focused their gazes on the burning hole that ran through the floor of the cockpit and reached past the street. The hole reached all the way into the tunnel underneath the street.
"His cockpit possesses an emergency underground boring system!" Addy spoke. "He snuck away while we were waiting for him to surrender!"
"What are you waiting for?! Get after him!" Commander Breskin barked. "Keep up the cordon and extend our perimeter to the drainage system underneath the streets. While you’re at it, deploy every anti-stealth measures that we have on hand! He couldn’t have snuck under our noses without employing some sort of stealth system."
Everyone on the field scrambled to track down the elusive bastard. Several rebel specialists jumped down the hole inside the cockpit and activated specialized tracking devices that could magnify even the smallest traces.
"The trail is faint, but he’s heading west!"
This prompted the rebels to deploy a special canister. Once thrown, the device stopped in mid-air and dispersed coarse particles in the air. These particles floated in the air for minutes at a time and looked very distinctive. Anything that passed through would immediately stir up the particles, exposing anyone trying to sneak past the affected area.
It was an extremely low-tech solution to a high-tech means of evasion. Despite the simplicity of the idea, it was very reliable when deployed in a smaller area as long as the search parties brought enough canisters.
The rebels didn’t expect their target to be stupid enough to stumble into the particle fields. Instead, they formed a cordon of particles in a loose circle surrounding the cockpit crash site.
After they deployed the first wave of canisters, the rebels tightened the circle and deployed another wave of canisters. This would go on until they uncovered their target or met each other at the center.
The people on the ground also utilized other methods to track down Lord Javier. For example, the trackers in the drainage tunnel followed the faint trails that Javier’s stealth system hadn’t been able hide.
"Keep an eye on the particles! He won’t be able to bypass them, but he might attempt to mold his suit behind an obstacle. Double-check each surface if you have to!"
As Ves watched the rebels trying to sniff out their fleeing prey, he began to frown a bit. Most of the rebels believed that Lord Javier might have nowhere else to go, but he didn’t believe that the man would be so easily caught. After witnessing so many of his tricks, Ves kept getting the feeling that they overlooked something important.
His brain churned as various ideas flitted past his mind. He tried to put himself in Javier’s boots. A frightening possibility emerged in his mind. Though he lacked the proof to back his assertions, he nonetheless felt it was important enough to inform the rebels.
Ves switched into the command channel. "Commander, Addy, don’t put too much stock on the trail! I would bet a billion sovvies that the trail in the tunnel is a decoy!"
"So you believe he climbed back to ground level?" Addy asked with a fair amount of skepticism in her tone. "Even if he snuck back onto the streets, he won’t be able to evade our particle emissions."
"The particle clouds won’t do a thing to Javier because they only float up to five meters in the air! Think! Does Javier lack any means to float into the air?! I believe he’s trying to fly away under stealth right this instant! He’s laughing at us while we toil on the ground!"
"I believe you." Breskin responded. He hardly hesitated in believing this possibility. "We’ve borrowed much of our tracking methods from the instruction manuals of the auxiliary regiments. Lord Javier would certainly take into account that we would deploy these methods beforehand and plan ahead."
Still, even if they suspected that he was getting away in the air, they didn’t possess enough canisters to cover the entire airspace in the area surrounding the downed cockpit.
They could either deploy their limited canisters in a limited volume of space above the ground, or continue their sweep on the ground. They couldn’t pursue both options at the same time, not without bringing additional canisters stored back in base!
By the time they transported the extra canisters to the area, Lord Javier might have gotten away already!
As someone who made use of a really great stealth system from the System, Ves knew all about their strengths and weaknesses. Though he had no clue how the stealth system prevented any signals from leaking out of a bubble of space and covered all of his tracks, it still wouldn’t be able to deal with something as simple as a cloud of particles or other junk.
Though the particle canisters offered the rebels on the field with a ready-made solution to sniff out anyone under stealth, before the invention of canisters, humans improvised many other means.
"Wait a moment." Ves interjected. "You still have a lot of missiles left, right?"
Breskin immediately knew what he was thinking. "Slaying Lord Javier is out of the question. We can’t afford to pulverize him with a blanket missile bombardment!"
That sounded really strange to Ves. Weren’t they out to kill Lord Javier? What did it matter if he died on the battlefield, when they would just kill him in their custody? Ves set the matter aside and focused on persuading the commander before Javier flew away.
"You don’t have to set the missiles to maximum lethality. Make them explode above the altitude that Javier is probably trying to reach and saturate the surroundings in a dome of explosions. The smoke and shockwaves will be sufficient to disturb his stealth even if he’s well outside the blast zone of the payloads."
"I understand what you’re saying, but it’s an enormous risk."
"It frees up your particle canisters." Ves pointed out. "This way, you don’t have to decide between spreading your particles at ground level or in the air. Your infantrymen can keep sweeping the streets while letting your missiles take care of whatever might be floating above.
Breskin needed to decide quickly, because with each second, Javier would slip further and further away.
"Let’s do it." Addy said. "The missiles are meant to be used, and if we accidentally kill the bastard, then it’s still better than letting him get away scott-free."
They ultimately bowed down to necessity. As much as they evidently wanted to keep the little bastard alive, they couldn’t afford to lose in front of everyone that paid attention. Their prestige didn’t allow them to fail at the cusp of victory.
The rebels moved quickly. They still possessed a decent stock of missiles, enough to blanket a wide dome around the abandoned cockpit for ten or so minutes. Ves helped tweak the programming of some of the missiles to limit their lethality and disperse their emissions.
His shallow familiarity with missile weapons left out any drastic modifications. While low-tech explosive missiles weren’t very sophisticated, it still took an expert to optimize them to achieve a specific outcome.
Dedicated missile developers and mech designers specialized in missiles could do a much better job than Ves, but he made do regardless by tweaking the easiest settings. Since time was of the issue, he only spent thirty seconds at most.
"Launch them now!"
The operators in Breskin’s mobile command center planned out the missile launches in the time that Ves tweaked the missiles. This didn’t take a lot of time, since they instructed AIs to calculate an optimum spread of missiles above the streets. They spent more time in double-checking the results to insure the missiles didn’t detonate next to one of their men or something.
"Three, two, one, launch!"
Over a hundred missiles launched in the air from various points. Most of them consisted of smaller shoulder-launched warheads. Only a small amount of vehicle-launched missiles joined the fray. While larger missiles blanketed a much larger area, their lethality encompassed a much wider zone. The AIs calculated that it was better to saturate the airspace with lots of smaller missiles than a smaller number of larger ones.
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
Deep thrums shook the ground as the explosions in the air kicked up a lot of air. The airspace above everyone’s head whipped up violently as multiple shockwaves from near-simultaneous explosions overlapped with each other.
In the meantime, all sorts of sensors focused in the air. They tried to pick up any disturbance they could pick up. Inside the rebel base, processors worked to interpret any anomalies in the sensor data, dismissing most of them as artifacts or erroneous readings.
One anomaly quickly stood out. A small, indeterminate mass hovered a small distance away from the Raphael’s cockpit. The moment the shockwaves from the nearest explosions blanketed the coordinates of the mass, some of the winds swept around the mass instead of going through it. Though the signs were subtle to the naked eye, it might as well be in plain sight to the cold hard electronics that made up the sensors and the processors.
"There! Throw up a smaller range of explosions around that area!"
A small number of shoulder-launched missiles flew into the air and detonated in a smaller dome around the anomalous location. This time, the explosions happened a little bit closer. The closer range and the higher concentration of missiles whipped up a lot more air than last time. This only made it more obvious that an invisible object displaced some of the winds around its form.
"It’s definitely a stealthed object!"
Though they only established that they found a stealthed object, the shape and dimensions of the object looked suspiciously like a man-sized stealth suit.
The Detemen League moved quickly upon confirmation that something invisible hung in the air. A pair of armored shuttles flew from the distance and halted in mid-air in the region around the invisible object. Hatches slid open, enabling the infantrymen inside to throw out a bunch of particle canisters.
Particles spread out in a large and hazy cloud around the shuttles. Almost immediately, a very obvious deformation stood out in the even spread of particles. "Over there!"
One of the infantrymen in the shuttles stepped forward. Unlike the other men, this soldier carried a man-sized fluid projector borrowed from the local Planetary Guard. After a brief windup, a brown slurry of slime propelled from the nozzle of the projector.
Under the onslaught of the sticky slime, the stealthed shape could no longer maintain its invisible state. A skintight suit enveloped in increasing amounts of slime appeared in the air.
"UGH! Disgusting!" Lord Javier’s voice sounded out from the helmet. "Ah! Help! I can’t maintain altitude!"
The gunk weighed down the suit and affected the suit’s antigrav modules. The man inside the suit could only be the person they had been searching for, and right now he flailed his limbs in panic as his suit slowly drifted down.
"That’s enough slime!" Breskin warned the soldier with the fluid projector. "Catch him when he lands. No wait, grab him from out of the air. We can’t risk our target falling to his death."
Someone else deployed a net launcher that reeled in the slime-covered stealth suit. The soldier with the fluid projector switched settings and doused their captive with a different spray of fluids that caused the slime to dissolve and wash away.
This enabled the rebels secure the man and remove all of the holdout weapons and gadgets embedded into the suit. Still, that didn’t remove the risk of any other tricks, so the soldiers unceremoniously tore off the stealth suit and the helmet away from their captive.
"My clothes!"
Once they pulled off the helmet from the man, the familiar face of the man who once ruled Detemen IV scowled at the rebels in the shuttle. "Do you know who I am?! You’re dead! You’re all dead!"
One of the rebels smacked his gauntlet against Javier’s face. "Shut up!"
They possessed enough training to focus on their duties. They ignored the squealing noble and frisked his naked body with utmost seriousness. Lord Javier proved his craftiness many times.
The scanners running over his body beeped in alarm as they detected several anomalous objects. The men didn’t hesitate when they cut Javier’s arm to extract a tiny device embedded into the muscles. Once they pulled out the object, a medic sprayed the cut with a solution that rapidly healed it up.
The soldiers repeated this routine several times, only stopping when they found they couldn’t easily extract the foreign materials that had been buried deep within Javier’s body.
"Bring him back to base." Breskin said with an exhausted tone. "Our doctors will pull out all the rest. After that, we can commence with the interrogation."
"Let me go!" Javier screamed over the pain of having his skin cut and healed. "My father will hound you until the ends of the galaxy for this, and he’s not the only one who has an eye out on me! If you know who you just pissed off, you’ll be pissing your pants!"
"Shut him up. We don’t need him conscious."
One of the soldiers injected Javier with a knockout solution that instantly sent him to sleep. The quiet brought some tranquility back to the shuttle.
Ves leaned back in his chair and rubbed his eyes. After so many risks, they finally managed to get their hands on Javier. He almost didn’t believe that it was finally over. From what the lordling demonstrated so far, Ve was sure that Javier would pull another rabbit out of his hat.
"Evidently, there is only so many rabbits he can pull out at any time."
As he waited for Javier to be brought back to base, Ves reflected on Javier’s struggles. The depth of his preparation exceeded anything that Ves could imagine. From falling back to his hidden base underneath the recycling plant to sneaking off in a stealth suit, Lord Javier had demonstrated an extreme capacity for survival.
If not for the critical clues that Ves deduced in time, Lord Javier would have slipped through everyone’s grasp.
Witnessing the entire chase made Ves feel a little inadequate. While he could have emulated most of the noble’s methods with his old comm, his current service with the Vandals forced him to do away with most of his survival tools. Compared to the gadget-laden Javier, Ves felt very barren.
"I have to be more tenacious."
Once the Flagrant Vandals retreated from this star system, Ves planned to remedy this shortcoming. Of course, that entailed asking for special dispensation from the Vandals to carry more special equipment, but with his substantial contributions in this operation, Ves hoped that his superiors would be lenient.
"I deserve a bonus for all the work that I’ve done."
Without Ves, Captain Orfan wouldn’t have been able to field the mechs of the Dastardly Handsome Bastards. Without Ves, the rebels wouldn’t have been able to track down Javier’s location. Without Ves, Javier would have gotten away by flying leisurely in the air under stealth.
And that only encompassed his greatest contributions. Ves didn’t know what kind of merit system the Vandals used, but Ves felt that he would have been eligible for promotion for everything he did.
"Too bad mech designers don’t fall into their organizational system."
In the end, if Ves wanted any rewards, he had to knock on Professor Velten’s door. The notoriously stodgy old lady was a stickler for rules, and Ves wasn’t sure if any of his achievements gained him any rewards.
"I can’t wait to get back, though. I’m more than done with this crappy planet."
Everyone felt relieved with the hunt at an end. Once the rebels took custody of Lord Javier, the remaining forces of House Eneqqin in the vicinity broke apart and tried to flee the city.
The Vandal mechs that delayed them from reinforcing Lord Javier let them go without a fight. In any case, they completed all of their objectives. They never intended to crush every enemy mech.
Of course, the rebels also spread the news of the successful capture through their propaganda networks. News of what had happened spread through both sides of the conflict in an instant with the help of the galactic net.
Both the Bright Republic and the Vesia Kingdom reacted with astonishment!
Some of the shipwrecked Vandals stranded in the rebel base requested to be sent back to their comrades. Now that their forces took out most of the anti-air turrets controlled by the household troops, it was a lot safer to fly some transports in the air.
Certainly, many enemy mechs and turrets remained intact, but their owners lacked the guts to fire upon Vandal or rebel assets. Everyone who survived up to now tried their best to bury their heads in the sand while their enemies run amuck in the city.
"Are you sure you don’t want to leave with our batch?" Lieutenant Burke asked Ves. "Our job is done here."
Ves shook his head. "I’ll follow you out in the next transport. I want to be there while the rebels interrogate Lord Javier. I’ve managed to convince the commander that my presence would be useful if Javier spills out anything related to mechs."
His help was integral in catching the the little lordling. Ves built up a substantial amount of goodwill with the Detemen League. When he asked to be present at Lord Javier’s interrogation, the rebels easily accepted his lame excuse. To them, Ves was pretty much one of them. This was an amazing concession of them because they refused the presence of every other Vandal aside from Captain Orfan.
When the lightly-wounded captain entered the base, Ves became affected by certain emotions. He was very clear that Captain Orfan didn’t give a damn about him. The captain barely nodded at him before she resumed her discussion with Addy.
Ves didn’t need her to like him, but he at least wanted her acknowledgement.
"Well, I don’t need her to recognize me anyway."
It was in the nature of mech pilots to forget the existences of norms, those who fell under the vast majority of people who would never be able to pilot a mech. Some potentates possessed stronger biases than others.
The most extreme cases called for a drastic rearrangement of human society in the model of Ancient Sparta. In their delusional imagination, only mech pilots deserved to be free. As the only citizens of the state, they possessed all the rights in exchange for shouldering the obligation of piloting mechs.
As for everyone else, they would be destined to carry the label of slaves. Anyone without the potential to pilot mechs was expendable. Even the most renowned mech designers that enabled the mech pilots to exert their skills enjoyed no extra rights. In the perspective of the ruling class, mech designers were slaves as well, only with a bit more value.
The crazy thing about this imagined utopia was that a number of human states tried to implement such a society.
Every attempt ended in ruin. In truth, depressing the potential of over ninety-six percent of the population caused these extremist states to stagnate. Slaves without any sense of belonging never worked to better their masters as much as a free man.
Numerous examples throughout the Age of Mechs illustrated that humanity needed to work for every human, not a tiny subject with a mutant brain.
Sadly, it appeared that Captain Orfan didn’t get the message. She barely treated Addy with respect, something the observant rebel woman noted fairly quickly. Regardless, Addy flexed her diplomacy and managed to convince the mech captain to rest somewhere in piece. Once she got rid of Orfan, she strayed over to Ves.
"I never really did thank you for your help. You’ve really saved us, Mr. Larkinson."
Ves smiled at that. "Any other mech designer could have done the same."
"Yet you’re the only one who’s here."
That soured his mood a little. "Have you ever found my colleague Alloc?"
He tried to look up the Journeyman Mech Designer’s whereabouts. As his mentor within the Vandal design department, Ves appreciated Alloc’s insightful lessons. The lack of news regarding his status concerned Ves a lot.
Through the rebel base’s communication channels, Ves contacted the Flagrant Vandal fleet in orbit several times. Each time, they told him that they hadn’t picked up Alloc’s crash ball in space. Since Alloc sat next to Ves in the command center of the Stubby Growler, there was a high possibility that Alloc’s crash ball followed the same trajectory as the one that held Ves.
"Maybe he landed somewhere else over the planet."
Not everyone who crash-landed onto the surface of Detemen IV chose to converge at Neron City. Those with timid hearts chose to land somewhere desolate, and await for pickup from a Vandal shuttle. It was a much safer option than landing in the vicinity of the most important city on the planet.
"He’s here!"
A familiar armored shuttle entered the vehicle bay of the underground base. As soon as it touched down, a full squad of armed infantrymen hauled the unconscious form of Lord Javier.
In a minor gesture of decency, they clothed his previously-naked form with generic grey clothes. Nonetheless, the drab fabric only accentuated his fall from grace. His matte blond hair was normally styled in exquisite fashion in public. Now, they looked tousled and sweaty beyond recognition.
A number of rebels that hadn’t shipped out yet goggled at Lord Javier’s beaten form. They hardly believed that they actually managed to capture such a powerful figure. Though they worked together with Flagrant Vandals to accomplish this feat, it was still an exceedingly rare achievement for a local rebel movement.
Every commoner of the Kingdom learned early on that the dignity of a noble should not be sullied. Profane acts such as questioning their sexuality might even prompt a Vesian judge to sentence them to death!
Thus, witnessing the powerful Lord Javier being dragged to the medical bay like a dog was a very transformational moment for the rebels. Everyone present made up the cadre of their organization, so they all believed in the cause with the depths of their hearts.
They just never imagined that they could pull down a noble from his pedestal in their lifetimes.
"He’s really here. I still can’t believe it."
"We did it... we did it!"
"None of the other rebel groups can boast what we’ve done!"
Some of the members of the Detemen League grew emotional and knelt down. Others cried and hugged each other. After living in Detemen IV like rats, they showed that they still possessed teeth.
Ves was the odd man out in this spontaneous emotional outburst. Compared to everyone’s jubilation, he only felt weary and longed to return to the Wolf Mother. Only in the confines of the factory ship would Ves feel at home.
"What the Vesian nobles do to their commoners and vica versa is not my business." He reminded himself. "Only the interests of the Republic matters to me."
In that regard, stirring up the Kingdom by facilitating a rebellion certainly weakened the Kingdom.
Some time later, Ves entered an observation room that looked out into a plain interrogation room. For something as sensitive as this, the rebels didn’t employ any projectors, for fear of leaking out this session. Having learnt his own lesson on how powerful hacking could be, Ves understood the necessity of these precautions.
A handful of other people stood in the room. Ves recognized Addy and Captain Orfan. Most of the others consisted of the highest-ranking rebel cadre.
It appeared that the rebels treated this interrogation with utmost importance.
A couple of medical doctors stood behind some sort of console that displayed Javier’s every physiological reaction. Right now, they appeared to be administering some stimulants to his body.
"Careful with the dosage." A senior doctor warned. "Lord Javier has undergone many surgeries and treatments that optimized his body and mind."
This meant that Javier would also be more resilient to many forms of interrogation. Perhaps Lord Javier would still be forced to spill out all of his secrets if the Coalition managed to get their claws on him, but the rebels only possessed means comparable to a local law enforcement office. They didn’t have access to better tools.
"He’s waking up."
A groggy-eyed Javier woke up from the chair that bolted down his limbs. He tried to jerk at them, only to press his skin.
"Ouch!"
The young noble blinked a few times more and shrugged off the fog in his mind. He tried to stare ahead but didn’t get blinded by the concentrated light that shone down onto his face.
"If that’s your best attempt at disorienting me, then I’ve got nothing to fear from you scum!" The noble boasted with confidence.
Commander Breskin sat in the opposite seat. The rebel leader appeared to be alone in the room with Javier, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. In the observation room Ves could see a number of operators sitting behind their consoles feeding in information and suggestions into Breskin’s ear.
"You’re alone, Javier. Your honor guard is dead or missing, and your household troops have scattered in the wind. There is no one left in Neron City or the entirety of Detemen IV for that matter that can come to your aid."
Javier spat at the table. "I know you won’t let me go. Is your drivel meant to make me lose heart? Never! I know my own fate! I won’t live past this day, and I’ve accepted this fact! So skip all the pleasantries and put a laser beam through my head!"
One of the doctors in the observation room scratched his head. "I thought the drugs and stimulants have caught on. The subject is supposed to be in a highly suggestible state!"
"That’s why I told you that most of our preparation don’t work. His brains work differently than ours. It’s been augmented to such an extent that most of our drugs are ineffective."
Ves understood that the rebels wouldn’t be able to resort to any easy means of getting Javier to open his mouth. Even torture wouldn’t accomplish anything.
Therefore, Breskin didn’t employ any fancy tricks of high-tech means of getting Javier to talk. The old commander opted to go for a plain but direct approach.
"I’m not interested in the secrets of your House." Breskin stated. "Nor am I eager to break you down. You’re not even worth that much to us dead."
Javier stared down Breskin with resentful eyes while keeping his mouth shut.
"We both know there is one thing we’d like to obtain from you. Two, in fact, but we found one of those things from your cockpit."
"That thing was too for me to carry around while I escaped. My stealth suit doesn’t allow me to bring anything anything of that size. How did you even find me at the end? From what I know of you and your pathetic rabble, you should have been fooled!"
"We benefited from some outside help."
"Brighters." Javier snarled in a low tone. "It’s one thing to overthrown our rule. I can respect your commitment to better your people, even if you sad sacks of meat don’t deserve to crawl out of the mud where you belong. Joining forces with the Brighters is another matter. That’s treason of the highest order!"
Some of the rebels in the observation room became affected by that accusation, while Captain Orfan shifted on her feet.
"We’d be better off if the Bright Republic won our generational war." Breskin grinned. "Call us traitors all you want. In my eyes, nobles like you are the real traitors here. Ever since you took up the reigns on Detemen IV, your very actions betrayed your duties to shepherd your people."
"Your people?" Javier raised his eyebrows. "None of you are my people! Lowborn filth like you don’t deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as my father and I."
Breskin shook his head. "You still adhere to those warped ideas. Let’s go back to my main point. As I’ve mentioned, while we’ve obtained one of the things we’re looking for, we know you still have the other thing in your mind."
"What do you want to do about it?" Javier grinned savagely at Breskin.
"I’d like to ask you politely to hand over the other thing."
The mood turned strange in the observation room. Everyone leaned forward in anticipation while Ves stood cluelessly in the rear. Even Captain Orfan appeared to be in on the secret.
What were these ’things’ that Breskin referred to?
The interrogation turned into a strange direction. Breskin tried to coax their captive into giving up the other thing. Nobody in the observation room looked puzzled when the interrogator and the interrogated spoke of the ’thing’ and the ’other thing’.
Was this a deliberate precaution against leaking out the true shapes of the ’things’ to Ves?
That didn’t make any sense. If so, the bedraggled Lord Javier should have been doing everything in his power to publicize the ’things’ out of spite. That he played along proved that the significance of these ’things’ were of such import that even he couldn’t lightly mention them by name.
Over time, Ves realized that they adopted this terminology because they’d been trained to avoid leaking any inadvertent information from any hidden recorders and spying bugs. Though the observation and interrogation rooms had been swept as thoroughly as possible, that was only up to the standard of a third-rate state.
What if a greater power such as the Friday Coalition or even the Mech Trade Association listened in on their conversations? Certainly, they wouldn’t devote a human to listen to their talk. Instead, they’d task some AIs to be on the lookout for certain key phrases that signified something of exceptional value.
Therefore, as long as everyone agreed to abide by generic words such as ’things’, they wouldn’t be able to attract too much attention from any high-tech listeners. At the very least, even if some AI suspected that they talked about something valuable, they wouldn’t be able to figure out any clues.
"I have nothing to say to you." Lord Javier responded smugly to Breskin. It was as if he had the upper hand in the interrogation room. "The ’other thing’ is safe as long as I’m alive, I can assure you.
Even a dummy like Ves could see that the lordling held all the cards in this game. The Detemen League and the Flagrant Vandals attached a lot of importance to these so-called ’things’. So much so that Breskin seriously contemplated whether to free Lord Javier in exchange for obtaining the ’other thing’.
After ten more minutes of cajoling, Breskin finally shook his head. "We will talk again after we have evacuated from this star system. For now, you will be coming with us."
He glanced at his comm and pressed a button, causing Javier’s restraints to inject a substance in his bloodstream. The captive quickly lost consciousness again. A pair of guards entered the interrogation room and took him away.
"Show’s over now."
"Damn, I really hoped that Lord Javier would give up what he knew."
"There’s no chance of that as long as he’s sober. We’re going to have to work for it. With an augmented mind and body like his, it might take months to compel him to spill the ’other thing’."
Ves wandered out of the observation room with more questions than answers. He even began to doubt the purpose of this entire operation. Could this entire operation have been set off to obtain the ’things’ in Javier’s possession?
"Probably not. It’s likely a combination of factors that led to the Vandals choosing to invade the Detemen System. Hitting multiple birds with one stone, basically."
In any case, now that the Flagrant Vandals completed all of their objectives on this planet, it was time to leave. Ves received a notification that he was assigned to the second convoy to the Vandal beachhead on this planet.
"You’ll be leaving soon, right?" A voice spoke from behind.
"I am."
"I never got to thank you for all the help you gave us." Addy said. "Lord Javier is much more capable of hiding than we thought. If you hadn’t pointed us in the right direction, we would have let him slip. On behalf of the Detemen League, we express our thanks to your aid. No matter how far our paths diverge from this day, you’ll always be a friend to us."
At least the rebels showed their appreciation to him, unlike Captain Orfan.
Ves smiled back and shook her hand when she extended it. "It’s my pleasure. Any competent mech designer can do the same. I suggest you obtain your own means of fielding mechs when you escape to the stars. It’s too dangerous to roam around in space without the protection of mechs."
"We are working on it. We have to start from scratch, so it will take years to build up a mech tradition in our group."
For a local rebel movement, the Detemen League enjoyed a fair amount of support, especially in the later years of Lord Javier’s despotic reign. They didn’t lack for numbers, but in military terms this only granted them access to lots of cannon fodder.
They lacked an elite or sophisticated force that could act as their fist. While they mastered other forms of warfare, their severe deficiency in mechs would become a fatal flaw in the wildlands of space. No one respected any other vehicles except for mechs.
"Do you have any plans for the future? Where are you going to settle next, and what will you do in the coming years?"
Talk of the future caused Addy to grow melancholic. "I’ve never left this planet, do you know that? Most of us don’t. Leaving our home planets for the first time is going to be hard for us. Becoming vagabonds in space is not what we intended to become, but that appears to be the life set out for us. Many other rebel groups in the Kingdom have been pushed off their planets over time."
"And the most successful ones emerge to become regional powerhouses, I guess."
"That is how most regional rebel movements have come into being. They no longer become so attached to a single planet or star system, but set their sights over an entire region or Duchy."
A rebel movement without a home still needed to claim some turf. Perhaps in a couple of years, the Detemen League would call themselves by another name.
"Well, though I know your chances aren’t that great, I hope the ideals you’re fighting for will eventually succeed."
"Our cause has always been a stretch, Mr. Larkinson. Even we are realistic enough to recognize the apparent futility of what we are aiming to achieve."
"Then why fight in the first place? From what I’ve seen so far, while most commoners don’t care so much about the nobles, they don’t hold very strong animosity against the ruling class. It’s going to be extremely hard to shift the public against the nobles at this rate."
"It is hard to convince the ignorant flock to open their eyes, yet we never pause. We can’t. Even if we’re nothing but annoyances to the nobles, at least we are expressing our existence. The presence of rebel groups like ours restrain the nobles from going too far. The more depraved they become, the faster we grow."
In other words, even if the rebels possessed a limited amount of influence and power, the threat of their existence and the possibility of fueling their rise curbed the worst excesses of the nobles that possessed absolute power over their territories.
Tradition, laws and culture might have given the nobles the right to rule their lands, but the foundation of their power lay in how much the commoners supported them. Any territory with a discontented population became a net drain on a noble’s earnings.
"If I may ask, there is one more thing I’m curious about. During Javier’s interrogation, Breskin keeps asking about the... stuff. I don’t know if I’m the only one in the observation room who wasn’t clued in, but can you tell me something about what you were talking about?"
Addy pursed her lips. "If you don’t know the true meaning of that word, then you shouldn’t know about it in the first place. I’m sorry Mr. Larkinson, but knowledge of what they talked about is only available on a need-to-know basis."
That definitely shut up any avenues for questioning. Ves couldn’t ask anything else about the sensitive topic surrounding Javier’s capture. All he knew was that the rebels would be taking the little bastard with them in their flight from the system.
After Ves said goodbye to Addy, he walked over to the shuttle filled with supplies and a couple of men that was about to head over to the Vandals. Ves saw Captain Orfan sitting in the front, but he didn’t go up to greet her. Instead, he sat in the rear of the shuttle.
The armored shuttle began to lift off a few minutes later. Escorted by a bunch of other vehicles, the shuttle ascended fairly low in the air and navigated over Neron City, straying far away from any compounds with a significant amount of defenders.
The journey proceeded quietly. None of the local powers dared to intercept their shuttle. The moment they showed any hostility, the Vandals would surely come and crush them. It was better for them to wait out this invasion and thank their lucky stars that they’d been able to make it through the crisis intact.
Ves almost expected something to happen anyway. Throughout his unprepared adventure on the surface of Detemen IV, a lot of things that could have gone wrong actually did go wrong. All of the pressure kept Ves in a high-strung mood, and he expected trouble from every corner.
That nothing happened during the flight only raised his hackles a bit. The possibility for a major disaster always hung over head.
"Huh. We made it through alive."
Ves stepped out of the shuttle with bewilderment. The armored shuttle successfully managed to cross half the city and reach the small beachhead the Flagrant Vandals initially set up as their temporary base during their stay on this planet.
The Vandal ground force erected dozens of prefab structures. Most of them appeared to be warehouses that received incoming loot and sorted them out into compact containers to be shipped to orbit.
A new transport or shuttle descended from the air around every two minutes. Bots led by a few cargo handlers stuffed them full of containers and other goods before sending the vehicles back to orbit. The sheer amount of vehicles touching down or lifting off all the time hinted to Ves that the Vandals obtained plenty of valuables during their raids on the local manufacturing complexes.
Ves loosely estimated that the Flagrant Vandals wouldn’t be able to pay off their enormous debts, but the profits should be enough to half their financial obligations.
Of course, this only applied to the detachment over Detemen IV. The other half of the fleet must have raided a lot of valuables as well over Detemen II.
"Ves! Is that you?!"
"Pierce! What are you doing down here?!"
Ves never expected to see an Apprentice Mech Designer on the ground. Seeing Pierce Yuvalis again put a smile on his face. They hugged each other in brotherly camaraderie, not caring for everyone else’s stares.
"I volunteered to go down the surface." He explained a short moment later. He thumbed his finger towards one of the nearby heavy mechs that entrenched itself in some sort of purpose-built half-bunker. "I’ve been assigned to the Akkara design team, but I don’t possess a natural affinity for heavy mechs. It’s hard to see them in action in space, so I asked the professor to send me down with the ground force so I can stay close to the Akkaras without exposing me to too much danger."
"Has it been useful? I was preoccupied with trying to survive on the other side of Neron City, so I haven’t been able to catch up to the battles that took place here."
"You haven’t? I’ve witnessed so many maneuvers, some of which you should definitely know about! Let me bring you back to my temporary office so I can show you some of the recordings."
"Ah, one more thing. Has there been any word of Alloc?"
Pierce faltered a bit. "He’s still missing as far as the Flagrant Vandals are concerned. Professor Velten is all worked up about it and she’s been nagging the forces on the ground to expand their search perimeter."
Alloc hadn’t been found yet? That did not bode well for the Journeyman Mech Designer. Ves grew rather concerned by now. He shouldn’t have been out of contact for so long. Even if he became indisposed for some reason, his comm should have enabled the Vandals to hone in on his last known location. That the search parties failed to sniff out his trail meant that the Journeyman’s fate wasn’t so simple.
His colleague from the same batch of conscripted mech designers led him around the temporary base. Ves thought that someone like Pierce who grew up under a mech designer from the Friday Coalition should have experienced a lot of sights, but the man behaved like a kid who entered a candy store for the first time.
"Look at this Ves! This scrapheap is all the mechs they’d been able to salvage from the defenders of the city’s manufacturing complexes. Most of these scraps aren’t very valuable, so the Vandals plan to leave them behind."
The sheer amount of mechs and mech parts piled up showed Ves that the Vandals overwhelmed a lot of complexes. They took back the goods they produced and the most valuable materials used in their production. They also dragged back any spare wrecks and raided the most valuable components out of their hulks.
The mech graveyard in front of him appeared notable in that over half of their mechs lost their armor plating. The Vandals must have stripped them out because they incorporated valuable exotics.
Pierce showed him several other sights, all the while describing the battles the ground forces fought. The young man was visibly enamored with all that had happened.
Ves was different. What Pierce described was actually a routine invasion against a semi-prepared but inferior defense force. The mechs aligned to House Eneqqin put up a valiant fight, but their lack of numbers skewed the battles against them from the start. There was no doubt that the Vandals would gain ultimate control over Neron City.
He had to stop himself from shaking his head or giving Pierce a patronizing look. After living through harrowing times on Groening IV or the Glowing Planet, what happened on Detemen IV seemed like a cakewalk.
This was the benefit of experience, he guessed.
A mech designer that saw more of the galaxy possessed a wider perspective. This extra life experience broadened their vision and numbed them to the mundane things that others found special.
It also made Ves feel as if he stood apart from an inexperienced mech designer like Pierce. Though the man helped design many mechs while under the employ of a large mech manufacturer, it also isolated him from experiencing the outcome of his own work.
Ves felt that was important somehow, especially now that he compared his own life experience to Pierce’s.
At the end of the tour, Ves and Pierce waited to be sent back into space. Once they finally received a message to board the next transport that would lift off into orbit, Ves eagerly headed towards the vehicle.
"Whoa there, Ves! What’s the hurry?"
"I don’t want to miss my ride!"
Ves became a bit paranoid about being left behind on this awful planet. While not as bad as some of the places he visited, he still didn’t wish to linger any longer than he had to.
More than an hour later, Ves finally transferred over to a combat carrier. While he would only be aboard the ship for a few days, he already felt as if he returned home.
The Flagrant Vandals accumulated many different models of combat carriers, so every ship looked unique. Different from the Stubby Growler, the Antecedent took on an even fatter shape. This reduced her maneuverability under atmosphere, but in the vacuum of space, most of her mobility remained unaffected.
Though Ves possessed little expertise in spacecraft, he traveled aboard many different ships. In some, he even got the opportunity to be part of the crew, so he picked up a few things here and there where his expertise in mech design overlapped with ship engineering.
Ves didn’t know anyone aboard the Antecedent, and the Vandal officers didn’t spare a glance at them. Ves and Pierce mostly stayed holed up in their cabins as they waited for the Vandals to depart from the star system.
An alarm quickly blared over their heads, only to shut off a second after.
"What’s that?!" Pierce jumped up.
"I don’t know, but if the captain of the ship shut off the alarm right after, it’s nothing serious." Ves guessed.
They both left their cabins and wandered over to the mess hall where spacers simply couldn’t shut up. There, they overheard the reason why the alarms had been tripped.
"The Vesians reinforcements have arrived."
A bit sooner than expected, the first Vesian fleet arrived at the outer regions of the Detemen System from the closest star system.
"They’re here fast. I thought they would be taking their sweet time."
"This system’s neighbors can’t be seen dragging their feet too blatantly. They’ll fall out of favor with the Duchess if they scorn her commands."
"How long do we have?"
"Jimmy told me that we’ve got to scram within four hours. Any longer and we’ll get caught by the leading elements of the reinforcement fleet."
Four hours was a very short time. The ground forces needed to evacuate with extra haste and leave behind their less valuable loot at this rate. While unfortunate, the early arrival of the reinforcement fleet was well within their expectation.
Though Ves hated to admit it, the constant insistence on haste worked in their favor. Though their operations on Detemen IV didn’t proceed very smoothly, they hadn’t suffered many delays. Everything proceeded roughly on schedule, and the Vandal presence on the ground rapidly diminished as every working mech got boosted into orbit.
With cargo holds laden with mechs, materials and other goods, the fleet element under the command of Major Verle started to approach the nearest Lagrange point.
Ves and Pierce returned to their cabins for safety and looked at the fleet’s progress on a small projector that displayed their position in the star system.
He could see that the Vandals that orbited Detemen II took their sweet time in extracting from the planet. Since their planet was deeper within the star system, it would take a bit more time for the Vesians to intercept them. This gave the Vandals orbiting the second planet from the twin suns a larger buffer into getting all of their affairs in order.
Another fleet of rebel ships emerged from the surface of Detemen IV. It appeared the rebels stowed them somewhere deep and obscured their existence until the time had arrived for them to depart.
"What a sad collection of ships."
"They don’t appear to be in the best shape." Ves concurred with Pierce.
Compared to the worn but threatening shapes of the Vandal combat carriers, the ragtag collection of second-hand ships looked as if they belonged to a failed gang. The cargo haulers and transport ships limped slowly towards the Langrange point with barely functional thrusters.
"Seems like they didn’t have the funds or resources to spare for better ships."
Once they reached the point where opposing forces of gravity caused the area to have no strong force of gravity acting on it, the rebel ships transitioned into FTL without a hitch. At least the rebels must have taken some precautions with regards to their delicate FTL drives.
"Lord Javier is supposed to be aboard one of their ships, right?"
"That’s what I heard." Ves nodded. "Though I’m not sure if we should believe everything we heard. Our own side has fooled us more than once."
He couldn’t discount the fact that the rebels loudly spoke about taking custody of Lord Javier on purpose. It wouldn’t be above the Flagrant Vandals to play along with this ruse and quietly bring the noble away aboard one of their own vessels.
"Did you see him in person?" Pierce asked in an excited tone. Everything that happened so far has kept him in high spirits.
"I did, briefly."
"Is he as much of a douchebag as everyone says he is?"
"I think so. I can’t tell you much about the guy except to say that most of the stereotypes about him are probably true. He’s a real piece of work."
Ves also got the sense that Lord Javier was a lot more dangerous than he appeared. Even with the doctors stripped him of all of his implants and hidden tools, the noble still emanated a faint aura of threat that Ves only perceived from truly dangerous individuals such as Doctor Jutland.
He shook his head. Jutland was dead and the lordling was in their custody. What did he have to be so scared about? He turned his attention back to the display.
Over at the far side of the display, the ominous shapes of around a dozen combat carriers approached with indomitable purpose. Ves guessed that they likely didn’t possess the strength to crush either of the two Vandal fleet detachments, but possessed enough strength to interrupt any FTL transitions out of this star system.
Human FTL drives worked reliably in space with few gravitic disturbances. The depths of interstellar space formed the most ideal circumstances to transition out of the material dimensions, but sufficient distance from stars and Lagrange points formed tranquil enough areas that FTL still worked.
The incoming Vesian ships therefore weren’t out to get into a slugging match with the Flagrant Vandals.
They instead planned to harass their FTL transition by disturbing the Lagrance points where the Vandals currently flew towards. Any kind of gravitic mines and other means of generating artificial gravity could halt their escape and delay their departure until more reinforcements arrived.
Some of their fears came true when more reinforcement fleets arrived. Luckily, they all started at the same distance from the binary stars, and they arrived at a further angle from Detemen IV. This basically meant they needed to fly for more than five straight hours to reach the industrial planet.
"All of the other reinforcements will be too late." Ves nodded. "Just as expected."
The Vandals got the timing down pretty well. They gave up on hauling more loot from the surface at a certain time and they departed for the nearest Lagrange point with thirty minutes to spare.
In space combat, thirty minutes was cutting it close. Ves could even imagine some of the crew of the Antecedent grumbling about how much risks Major Verle had taken in order to retrieve as much valuables from Detemen IV as possible.
Fortunately, they encountered no delays or unforeseen problem. Only until the Antecedent entered into FTL along with the rest of the fleet did Ves truly relax.
"We’re finally out of the woods!"
Though the Vandal Fleet still faced a perilous journey to return to Republic space, at least they overcame the important hurdle.
Ves felt a bit directionless again in the next couple of days. From what he eavesdropped from the crew, the ships under Major Verle currently headed towards a lifeless star system. There, they would meet with the VRF and some other rebel movement who would subsequently guide them to their next hop in their journey.
Strangely enough, Major Verle’s detachment wouldn’t converge with Colonel Lowenfield’s detachment at their next destination. Ves had to approach a spacer and ask her in person to learn why.
"If you remember the system map, Detemen IV is located on one side of the twin stars while Detemen II is located roughly perpendicular from the stars and the other planet. This basically means it’s a bit troublesome for Colonel Lowenfield’s ships to transition immediately towards our upcoming destination."
Basically, the ships that raided Detemen II wouldn’t be able to rendez-vous with the ships that attacked Detemen IV without cutting through the gravity field of the twin stars.
Ships that attempted to do so never met a good end. It was already perilous enough to try to transition into FTL at a Lagrange point.
In the end, this meant that the Flagrant Vandals had to make do with two fleets at half strength.
That made him a bit uncomfortable. There was safety in numbers. Traversing through the heart of Vesian space with around fifty of their usual strength put both fleets in significant danger. The sooner they merged back together, the better.
Their brief stay aboard the Antecedent yielded little excitement. Ves got to relax for the first time in almost a week, while Pierce still brimmed with excitement of all the fighting he witnessed on the surface.
"Man, calm down Pierce. You’re jumping around like a rookie whose cherry got popped. It’s starting to become embarrassing!"
"I’m sorry Ves." Pierce apologized and quickly calmed down. "It’s just that I’ve never witnessed the majesty of mechs at such a massive scales. Numerous companies of mechs moved around and clashed against each other in the suburbs of Neron City. Sometimes, over three-hundred mechs battled at once!"
That was nothing to Ves. He once witnessed the dreadful scale of two entire mech divisions trying to murder each other without reserve. The collision of a handful of mech companies paled in comparison.
"If you’ve learned anything from what you’ve seen, make sure to write them down before you forget them. There’s no guarantee we’ll witness another battle of this scale any time soon."
No matter how impressive such battles appeared, they drained a lot of money to both sides. Without any gains, a money-conscious mech regiment such as the Flagrant Vandals would never willingly throw themselves at formidable enemies.
The next couple of days, Ves and Pierce drew up their sleeves and helped with the aftermath of the largely successful operation. The spacers aboard the Antecedent took stock of the casualties and the haphazard piles of loot they stuffed inside the cargo hold.
The two mech designers spent most of their time assessing the battle damage of the Antecedent’s complement of mechs, which wasn’t much. As a spaceborn-oriented combat carrier, she took part of the initial battle and chase of the Vesian garrison fleet the Vandals smashed at the start of the operation.
Because that battle mainly unfolded into an ambush on the Vesians, the Antecedent’s mechs sustained relatively little battle damage.
Of course, chasing down a cornered rat often led to retaliation. Mech pilots with nothing to lose sometimes lashed out with all their hearts, which led to a handful of heavily damaged spaceborn mechs.
Surprisingly enough, the Inheritor light mechs took the brunt of the damage.
"These mechs aren’t very difficult to repair." Ves judged. He studied the spaceborn skirmishers extensively, and possessed a moderate grasp on their design. "The only challenge is to perform them as cost-efficient as possible. The easily solution would be to scrap the damaged portions and replace them with pristine equivalents."
At their current state, such a ham-fisted repair procedure would waste a lot of the fleet’s stock of rare exotics. These types of exotics needed to be bought from dedicated suppliers. The Vandals wouldn’t be able to plunder them from a random trade convoy or manufacturing complex.
"No, the best option is to restore the damaged components as best as we can."
With the help of the chief technician, Ves devised individual repair plans for each damaged Inheritor mech. He took into account the skill level of the mech technicians and low-ranking mech designers aboard the Antecedent. He quickly found out that the crew wouldn’t be able to accomplish the most complicated repairs with the facilities at hand.
This wasn’t an issue as the fleet enjoyed the services of several capable logistics ships. While the massive Wolf Mother accompanied Colonel Lowenfield’s detachment that escaped in another direction, the smaller logistic vessels at Major Verle’s disposal possessed sufficient capabilities by themselves. Ves merely needed to queue some orders for the most difficult parts to help the repairs along.
Ves also spent some time getting debriefed by a Vandal intelligence officer. This was mainly a dry affair where he mechanically recounted what he did aboard the Stubby Growler and when he crash-landed onto the surface of Detemen IV.
When he mentioned that his assistance was pivotal in tracking down Lord Javier, the officer raised a skeptical eyebrow. "Are you certain that you haven’t overstated your importance? Be aware that we have access to your logs on your comm."
"Go ahead, sir." Ves waved his hand. "The logs should clearly show how much I contributed to Lord Javier’s capture."
He knew that his military comm wouldn’t be such a simple device. It figured that it had some way of keeping tabs on his activities.
"Very well, Mr. Larkinson. You will hear from us later if we need some clarification. You can go back to work now."
Recounting recent events put Ves in an introspective mood. The relative period of tranquility aboard the Antecedent allowed him to unwind his nerves. While this relieved some of burdens, thinking about the chaotic circumstances of his accidental deployment on the surface of Detemen IV ruined his mood.
He couldn’t help but contemplate on whether he made a number of big mistakes. He could justify small mistakes and certain oversights on account of working under difficult circumstances. No one would be able to think clearly in the midst of several crises.
The only mistake that Ves really got hung up on was his extended use of his self-fabricated comm. Even though he always knew that the Mech Corps and by extension the Flagrant Vandals treated foreign electronic devices with paranoia, he still dared to make use of a civilian-grade comm.
In ordinary circumstances, such a sloppy oversight would have earned him a court-martial!
"Am I in trouble for this?"
Ves weighed the possibilities and tentatively judged that it wasn’t likely the Vandals would bring it up. He was alone for quite a while and tried to survive on the streets by himself. Such a lapse in security was excusable.
It was less excusable for him to continue to hang on to the comm when he came under Captain Orfan’s wing. In that, he made a genuine blunder.
"Although... it might not be due to my mistake that the base got bombarded."
As a local hegemon, House Eneqqin possessed many means of observations. The Vandals under Captain Orfan’s command didn’t surpass more than sixty or seventy servicemen. Most crucially, they lacked a hacker specialist who would be able to fool every enemy sensor in the vicinity.
"It’s likely that House Eneqqin has become aware that Captain Orfan took over the former premises of the Dastardly Handsome Bastards as soon as the takeover started. They just took longer than I thought to get their assets in position to bombard the base."
This possibility meant that even if Ves screwed up, his mistake might not have made a difference. If anything, it would have confirmed what House Eneqqin already knew.
Ves felt easier after coming up with his guess. Even if this hadn’t actually happened, it still served to alleviate his guilt somewhat.
"I need to go back to work."
Days passed. Once they arrived at their destination, the fleet that attacked Detemen IV took stock and began to transfer people and supplies among themselves. Major Verle ordered a comprehensive reorganization before his fleet resumed their flight.
In their haste to outrun enemy reinforcements, the Flagrant Vandals focused solely on speed. This had the unfortunate effect of stuffing mechs, salvage and supplies at any available space on hand. This led to many inefficiencies, such as storing an abundant of raw materials aboard a combat carrier while storing a lot of spare mechs aboard a cargo hauler.
Thus, the moment the fleet emerged from FTL, numerous amounts of shuttles and transports bounced from ship to ship to reorganize all of their cargo, mechs and personnel.
Ves received orders to transfer to the current flagship of this detachment, a command-oriented combat carrier called the Shield of Hispania. The Antecedent where they had been hastily dumped in wouldn’t allow them to utilize their capabilities to the fullest.
Other mech designers from the Vandal design teams got reallocated as well. Pierce for example would be taking up a post at one of the logistics ships of Major Verle’s fleet.
As Ves arrived on board the Shield of Hispania, he sighed as he studied a map of yet another combat carrier. Contrary to her name, the Shield of Hispania couldn’t endure a lot of hits. Compared to the Stubby Growler, the Hispania’s ship model was a lot older and had gone through many battles.
These battles slowly stripped her original excellent armor plating. With the Flagrant Vandals tight on money, they couldn’t afford to replace the damaged armor with plating of the same quality. They instead resorter to a cheaper armor system.
"Even with their ships, the Flagrant Vandals are forced to make a lot of compromises."
A fully funded mech regiment would never concern themselves over their budget to this extent. While mechs formed the primary mode of combat in human space, every large outfit on the scale of a mech regiment required a fleet of sturdy ships.
Plenty of stories existed of mech commanders who invested all of their outfit’s resources on mechs. They barely paid any attention to the ships meant to convey their precious mechs.
Without fail, all of their enemies who studied these outfits in detail exploited this vulnerability. Though their mechs fought valiantly in space or on the ground, cheap second-hand ships such as carriers converted out of decommissioned haulers always blew up after suffering damage that would be a glancing blow to proper carriers.
No matter how expensive and deadly their mechs, without any ships left to transfer them across interstellar distances, they became completely ineffective. All of that money invested in building them up turned into loose sand without the means to travel to a different planet or transition to another star system.
In fact, Ves grasped the necessity of a good ship as well. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have splurged billions of credits of his personal fortune to acquire the Trieste-class light carriers for the Avatars of Myth.
No matter if it came to mechs or ships, you got what you paid for, to a certain extent. The Shield of Hispania obviously used to be a prized vessel among the Flagrant Vandals, but after enduring a lot of abuse and inadequate repairs, her effective combat ability received a substantial truncation.
Without referencing any other documents, Ves could deduce all of that from the map projected by his comm and a visual scan of the exterior of the carrier as his shuttle approached one of the hangar bays.
More than that, Ves also noticed that the command center of the Shield of Hispania sat a bit awkwardly in the center of the map. The command center was a lot smaller than the one aboard the Stubby Growler, and the compartments around it adopted fairly awkward shapes.
"The command center must have been added later on as a retrofit. The shipwrights who designed and implemented this change tore up a lot of stuff as they did so."
This inevitably weakened the integrity of the Hispania’s hull and internal structure. It would be as if Ves crudely added a flight system to a landbound mech. Such a thick and heavy mech had not been designed to accommodate the space and energy draw that a flight system demanded. Thus, the only way to merge these two together would be to jury-rig a solution.
All of this pointed out that the Shield of Hispania could potentially crumble after receiving a couple of soft blows! The dual weaknesses of weak armor coverage and weak internal structure meant his berth was exceptionally vulnerable to kinetic and explosive damage!
"At least she won’t succumb after suffering a couple of laser hits. Even if her armor is of inferior quality, the sheer amount of thickness will help with absorbing a lot of energy."
"Switching out the Hispania’s original compressed armor system for a much thicker uncompressed armor system also slows her down to a major extent."
It was as if a professional sprinter grew fat. There was no way the sportsman would be winning any prizes at such a deplorable condition.
Ves would rather remain aboard the Antecedent. He even preferred to be transferred aboard one of the fragile logistics ships like Pierce because the Vandals cherished their safety.
Shortly after he arrived aboard the Shield of Hispania, Ves received a summons from the major himself. He handed his luggage towards a hauler bot that automatically brought it back to his cabin.
With that taken care of, Ves followed the map and marched towards the conference room in question. The expansive room that could have accommodated over fifty officers or mech pilots looked hollow and empty when no one arrived as of yet.
Ves picked a random seat in the middle of the conference room and plopped down on it. He wondered why the gruff major went through the trouble of summoning him in person when he could have sent him a notification on his comm.
"There must be something important he wants to discuss with me."
Hopefully the major would be able to dispel some of the questions lingering in his mind. He acquired several over the course of the flight from the Detemen System.
"Ves?" A faintly familiar voice sounded behind him.
"Iris!"
Ves looked surprised as the Vesian mech designer traipsed into the conference room after the hatch silently slid open. The woman smiled radiantly at him as she took a seat next to his own.
"I heard that something dreadful happened to you! Did you really escape the Stubby Growler as the Heavenfall missiles broke her apart and crash land onto Detemen IV?"
"It’s all true, sadly." He sighed. "How much have you heard?"
"Not so much. I’ve been assigned aboard another combat carrier that remained in orbit and performed routine duties during the operation."
Ves briefed her on what he lived through, though he couldn’t say too much because some of it touched upon classified information. The officer who debriefed him a few days ago forced him to sign a document which enumerated the topics he needed to keep mum on. Naturally, any mention of the ’things’ would instantly land him in the brig.
"It’s amazing how you survived all alone!" Iris said in astonishment as she referred to his starting moments when he crash-landed in the park. "What is this amazing weapon you used?"
"It’s something I got my hands on coincidentally."
Explaining away the Amastendira’s contribution to his survival was exceedingly difficult. Ves had to admit his story contained a lot of holes in that regard. When he got debriefed, he tried to skim over it as much as possible.
In any case, his ambiguous talk managed fend off the officer’s inquiries, at least that he was aware of. Ves bet on the that the logging function of his military comm possessed a lot of limits. Such a thin device on his wrist wouldn’t be able to keep track of everything he did with perfect fidelity. Thus, the acquisition of the Amastendira shouldn’t be a clear-cut matter.
He also underwent numerous frisks and body scans while he transferred from the surface to the Antecedent, and when he transferred from the Antecedent to the Shield of Hispania.
None of those security checks produced any contraband. Even if the logs of his military comm showed that Ves pulled out the Amastendira from thin air, they probably would have thought it was a glitch or something.
Still, a bright-eyed person might also conclude that the Amastendira was a powerful hidden trump card awarded by Master Olson. Only someone as wealthy and powerful as her could gift him such a high-tech toy.
Ves actually hoped that the Vandals bought into this misconception. More and more, Ves appreciated the benefit his status as Master Olson’s apprentice brought to him. He could whip it out like a talisman anytime he faced a difficult question that shared some relations with the System.
Faced with Iris’ insatiable curiosity, he let her make her own conclusions.
"I don’t want to talk too much about it. By the way, have you heard if Alloc has been retrieved yet?"
"Alloc Brandstad? No. As far as I’m aware of, he’s missing in action. They couldn’t find any trace of him in space or on the surface."
This affected Ves quite a bit. The Journeyman Mech Designer had been very considerate towards Ves, which was more than what the other two journeymen from the design department could boast.
Alloc was more than his superior. He was also a mentor of sorts to Ves.
"Then... is he dead?"
"We can never be sure of that." Iris shook her head. "Missing in action means he’s missing. More than that, no one can say. It could be his crash ball incurred heavy damage that might have damaged its locators and transceivers when it escaped from the Stubby Growler’s destruction. He might still be floating in deep space, though he won’t starve or suffocate to death because the Vesian reinforcements would likely pick up his crash ball’s presence."
This was only one of many possibilities. Ves grimaced as his thoughts took a darker turn. "Maybe he never survived the Stubby Growler’s destruction. Though he sat next to me in the command center, his crash ball might have taken a very different turn that launched him straight at the carrier’s power reactor or something."
"Don’t let the worst-case scenarios put you down. Even if it doesn’t sound very likely, he may still be alive. Don’t let go of that hope."
"Are you speaking from personal experience, Iris?"
She smiled ruefully at him. "When you mix in with the Vesian Revolutionary Front, you quickly learn that retirement isn’t an option."
Rebellion against a state condemned a person to the life of a fugitive. Space was large and empty, so enemies of the state could easily hide their presence somewhere. Yet to live in some barren rock or in the middle of interstellar space didn’t pay the bills.
Ships needed fuel and mechs required maintenance. People needed to be fed, but more importantly they also needed to strive for a dream. Without purpose, rebel movements tended to devolve into pirate gangs.
Principles couldn’t be maintained in isolation. Goals would always be forgotten when progress became stalled. Therefore, rebel movements constantly faced the pressure to remain proactive and take a lot of risks.
Accomplishing goals, placating their members and achieving a lot of renown among the people kept these movements alive, though the risks always came at a price.
"Have you lost many friends?" Ves asked.
"Some." She mused. "Thankfully none of my family. As mech designers and specifically as neural interface experts, we enjoy a fairly high status in the VRF. We aren’t exposed to as much danger as our mech pilots. Still, accidents can happen, so the possibility of what happened to Alloc always hangs over the Jupiters."
The VRF might be able to extend their tentacles across the entire Kingdom, but they wouldn’t be able to fool the ruling powers all the time. Back at home, the Republic regularly tracked down the bases of the Bentheim Liberation Movement and killed all of the rebels they found inside.
The Republic wasn’t magnanimous enough to expend an excessive amount of effort in securing prisoners from the noncombatants. Not after all the atrocities the BLM inflicted among civilians.
After a few more minutes of chitchat, Major Verle finally entered the conference room. He looked at Ves and Iris and nodded silently before storming over to the seat opposite of the conference table.
Once he sat down across from the pair, he stared at them with an unnerving expression. "Mr. Larkinson. I’m glad to see your escape from the Stubby Growler hasn’t turned you into an imbecile."
What was Ves supposed to say to that. He tried to keep his face as neutral as possible. "Major."
"And the lovely Miss Jupiter. Thank you for continuing to liaise between us and the VRF. We’ll be relying on your organization to evade the Vesian defense fleets that are out for our blood."
"It’s our pleasure, major." She said. "The VRF is satisfied with the conclusion of the Detemen operation. Enabling the local Detemen League in tearing down Lord Javier from his throne will go a long way in dispelling the infallible aura wrapped around the nobility."
Ves faintly suspected that Iris tried to pad his own accomplishments with those words. He played an integral part in pleasing the Detemen League, after all. The more Iris hinted that they felt pleased at his contribution, the more Major Verle might begin to appreciate his help.
Fat chance of that actually happening though.
"Let’s get down to business." The Major looked down upon the data pad in his grasp. "By completing our objectives in the Detemen System, our fleet is entitled to the assistance of the VRF in smuggling us out of the Kingdom, am I correct?"
"That is so, major." Iris nodded gently. "The agreement is still in effect. We acknowledge that the 6th Flagrant Vandals have played their part."
"That’s good to hear, because there’s a change of plans. We don’t want to return to the Tarry region."
"Pardon, sir?" Iris blinked. "Where else do you wish to go if not your home region at the other side of the border?"
"This is where it gets a little complicated. For various reasons, we have business to take care of. Don’t worry, the Vandal ships under Colonel Lowenfield’s command will continue to follow the original plan, so all of your organization’s preparations haven’t been made in vain."
"What is it you are intending to do, major?"
Miss Jupiter, new information and new circumstances compel us to run another mission at a location outside of Vesian or Brighter space. For this reason, the ships under my command will not be heading towards the rendez-vous system and merge with the colonel’s fleet. Instead, we are to form a separate task force that will run a special mission in Reinald space."
This caused Ves and Iris to widen their eyes.
"You wish to take your task force to the Reinald Republic?! That state is on the other side of the Vesia Kingdom’s border! It will take you further and further away from the Bright Republic!"
If Ves didn’t know that Major Verle held unquestioning loyalty to Colonel Lowenfield, he would have suspected him of attempting to desert and begin anew as an independent.
"If the VRF wishes to know more about our intentions, then I suggest you contact your liaison that is with Colonel Lowenfield’s fleet and have them ask the details from the colonel herself. I’m not at liberty to divulge the details of our task force’s mission."
Iris asked a few more questions, but Major Verle continued to stonewall her at every turn. Their mission must certainly be a sensitive one because the major hardly clarified anything at all. The only thing they needed to hear was that the task force needed to arrive at a certain star system within the Reinald Republic within two months.
"I’ll be honest with you, major. Two months will be very tight." Iris determined. "A legitimate trade convoy can make the same journey in a week, maybe two if they take the safest route. Yet for a massive task force like yours, it will be an incredible challenge, especially since we need to contact all of the regional rebel movements along the way and strike a deal with each and everyone of them. I’ll have to warn you now, their asking prices will assuredly be exuberant."
Major Verle dismissed her concerns. "Colonel Lowenfield is prepared to pay a good price. If our sovvies or credits are insufficient, we can also pay in military assistance, much like we helped the Detemen League. Our only demand is that it must not divert too much time from our journey to the Reinald Republic."
Obviously, such a last-minute change of plans would still upset the VRF. Iris looked very troubled all this time, and she foresaw a lot of yelling and browbeating in the coming weeks as the VRF tried to get the local bullies to play along.
Still, from what she heard, Colonel Lowenfield would absolutely make it worthwhile for them to facilitate the task force’s sudden journey.
"On account of the colonel, the VRF may probably agree to your request, but I may not be sure. I am only a liaison, you see."
"I understand, miss."
After that, the major finally turned to other man in the room.
Somehow, Ves felt as if a lot of trouble was about to land in his lap as well.
Major Verle went through rough times the past week. Not only did he shoulder responsibility for the Vandal detachment responsible for attacking Detemen IV, he also had to continue to play the shepherd for a couple of months more.
The operation on Detemen IV already proved to be a harrowing ordeal for Verle and his subordinates. Not only did they lose at least two combat carriers, some of their other ships sustained substantial damage. That they could slip into FTL without hiccups was already a minor miracle.
Around forty ships of different shapes and sizes relied on his leadership. Each came with a crew ranging from dozens to hundreds. From the humblest cargo haulers to the largest logistic ships, they all pooled their efforts into supporting the upkeep of up to a thousand active mechs.
In fact, this was a lot of responsibility to shoulder for a mech major. From what Ves had gathered from the mech designer boot camp, the officer needed to be at least a lieutenant colonel in order to wield so much authority.
When Ves glanced at Major Verle while he discussed some matters with Iris, he suddenly realized he didn’t know anything about the man. What was his origin? How did he fit in with the Flagrant Vandals? How much trust did Colonel Lowenfield put in him?
These questions became a lot more relevant as it seemed that Ves would spend a lot of time under his wing.
"Mr. Larkinson." The mech officer finally turned to him and addressed him with the usual veiled aggression typical to mech officers. "I’m glad to see you’ve survived the Stubby Growler’s untimely end. You’re a lot tougher than you look."
"Ah, thank you, sir."
The major grinned a little. "In fact, I’m quite impressed with your actions. I’ve read the reports about you and I can see you’re different from the other mech designers."
"If I may ask, how so, sir?"
Verle seemed to be in a strange mood this time. Ves could immediately tell that his valuation in the major’s eyes had undergone a large improvement.
"You’re smart like the others, but that isn’t enough to survive on the streets of Neron City by yourself. Anyone else like that brat Pierce you hung out with recently would have probably soiled their pants and cried like a sissy! Without others to lean on, even a single random thug can shoot them dead. What’s the use of intelligence in that case?"
"Mech designers aren’t trained to survive under those circumstances." Ves replied simply. Though Major Verle seemed to compliment him, Ves didn’t wish to belittle the value of his fellow colleagues. "Anyone would be hard-pressed after evacuating a disintegrating ship."
"Ah, but there’s more to it than that." Verle spoke. "As I said, you’re not one of those snotty nerds who can only act normal behind a terminal. You also know how to lead and take charge of complete strangers when needed."
"I have some experience with leading mech technicians. I also own my own company that’s doing fairly well for themselves last I heard."
"The LMC." He nodded. "I never heard about it, but I hear it’s on the rise back home. Not that I pay any attention to that in the first place. But that make you better than practically every other mech designer working with our mech regiment. You’ve got the guts to start your own company and fight for your own success."
"I had a lot of help with that."
"Help that you deserve. Not anyone can become the apprentice of one of those fancy Masters. You fought and competed against many other mech designers to grasp at an opportunity that very few can obtain."
Major Verle was definitely building up for something. Ves became a bit more cautious as the man uncharacteristically continued to praise his good points without mentioning any of his bad ones.
Ves decided to extend a probe. "I think your praise is a little misplaced. It’s only through a series of coincidences that I’ve managed to accomplish a few things on Detemen IV. I also stumbled a few times and didn’t strictly adhere to the rules of the mech regiment."
"Those are mere trifles." Verle waved his hand. "In the chaos of battle, anything is permitted. We call ourselves the Flagrant Vandals for a reason. None of us are sticklers for rules. Many of us are sent to our mech regiment because we don’t fit inside the neatly measured boxes the Mech Corps likes to put us in. Everyone among us has a skeleton in their closets somewhere."
This answer enlightened Ves a bit about the nature of the people he fought with for the past couple of months.
The Flagrant Vandals possessed their own pride and their own way of doing things. Their greatest challenge was to accommodate the diverse personalities of the servicemen sent in their way. Adhering too rigidly to rules would probably land more than half of the Vandals in the brig!
Perhaps this was why Ves hadn’t been called out as of yet. Major Verle and his task force still needed to process all of their gains and losses from the operation at the Detemen System. The repair and recovery efforts alone demanded all of their attention.
Ves stared at the major and wondered what skeletons he hid in his own closet. For someone like him to reach the rank of major yet be relegated to the Vandals, something big must be weighing him down.
Verle pressed on after Ves fell silent. "Doubtlessly you are aware of Mr. Brandstad’s current status. It’s supremely unfortunate that he’s missing. I enjoy a good rapport with him and I respect his capabilities like I respect yours. It’s not surprising that he’s Professor Velten’s golden boy."
By now, Ves deduced why Verle wanted to meet with him. With the Vandal fleet split into two, the people who fell under the major’s new task force had to fend for themselves. Ves quickly counted the mech designers attached to the task force and came to an unsettling conclusion.
"There are no other Journeymen in the task force."
"Precisely. For various reasons, the Wolf Mother remains with Colonel Lowenfield’s fleet. Professor Velten and two of the Journeymen have also remained aboard the factory ship. As for us, besides Mr. Brandstad, we saw no need in sending in another experienced mech designer."
The role of higher ranking mech designers did not feature very prominently in their planning. Even though they split their fleet assets fairly evenly, the Vandals kept most of their mech design prowess in the main fleet.
Alloc’s uncertain whereabouts led to an unfortunate circumstance where the mech designers of Major Verle’s task force turned into headless chickens. Without the reassuring presence of a prestigious Journeyman Mech Designer, the productivity of the other mech designers would certainly drop.
That is, unless Major Verle could find someone else to step in Alloc’s shoes.
"Someone as clever as you should know what I am about to ask."
"You wish for me to become the head designer of your task force."
Good heavens. Only someone as prestigious as Professor Velten would fit that role. A Journeyman could do it in a pinch, but an Apprentice would never be able to garner their total obedience.
The low-ranking mech designers that worked alongside the mech technicians didn’t know him at all. Whereas the high-ranking mech designers already witnessed his prowess, they envied him more than they respected him. Subduing them into obedient dogs without the requisite status couldn’t be done in a single day.
Despite the obstacles in his way, Ves did not wish to let this opportunity to. He knew that if he passed this duty onto Pierce or any of the other Apprentices, then he would be forced to obey the will of someone who didn’t know what he was doing.
Ves hated being subjected to someone else’s control. Whenever he got the opportunity, he would rather opt to take over the reins and be responsible for his own actions. That way, he wouldn’t become doomed by someone else’s screwups.
Naturally, the prerequisite of all of this was that he felt confident in his ability. Major Verle hadn’t exaggerated too much in his praise.
"Sir, while I cannot promise you that I can match Mr. Brandstad’s performance, I will do my best to fulfill my duty. What do my responsibilities entail?"
"For the full details, Professor Velten can fill you in through the military net. We are still in touch with Colonel Lowenfield’s fleet, and as head designer, your privileges will be bumped to match those that are normally enjoyed by Journeymen." Major Verle explained. "In short, as head designer, you’re the chief person responsible for the maintenance, repair, modification, configuration of all the mechs in our task force. You’ll take part in any conference I call up and provide your input on how our mech composition must change according to our mission profiles."
"Those are very big shoes to fill." Ves replied honestly. "I may be a bit lacking in experience in taking care of so many matters."
Even though he raised a company worth billions of credits out of nothing, he freely delegated the matter of managing his organization to the retainers loaned by the Larkinson Estate. People like Jake and Chief Cyril had proven themselves invaluable in controlling an entire corporation with thousands of employees.
Maybe Major Verle noticed the reason of his apprehension. "You have to deal with your obligations regardless of whether you are confident or not. The galaxy will not wait until you sum up the courage to do your job. Besides, being a head designer is no different from any leadership position. The key is to recognize capable people and fob off as much work you think they are capable of performing."
In other words, Ves should seek to delegate his responsibilities instead of performing them by himself. His eyes brightened a little when he realized that lesson.
"Thank you, sir. I shall take on my duties as a head designer without hesitation."
After that, the major passed him a data pad which held a few documents that confirmed his temporary elevation in writing. Reading the fine print, Ves would only take on the role for the duration of the task force’s existence. Once the task force disbanded or another Journeyman aligned with the Vandals came along, Ves would have to relinquish all of his privileges and responsibilities.
After the change became official, Verle threw out another question. "Can you guess what we prize the most among our mech regiment?"
Ves threw a guess. "Loyalty?"
"That’s a given, but that’s not the word I have in mind. It’s resourcefulness."
"Is it because we work under less than ideal circumstances?"
"Aye. Are you aware of our financial situation?"
"I’ve heard some stories, sir."
"It’s truly as bad as you hear. We’re cut off the Mech Corps and have to manage on our own. Many mech regiments would succumb under such circumstances. In fact, we almost became insolvent ourselves. Only after Colonel Lowenfield arrived did we take a turn for the better. We were already fairly resourceful back then, but the colonel taught us that we had a long way to go."
Ves had a feeling that Major Verle maintained a very different definition of resourcefulness than him. "Can you elaborate on what kind of resourcefulness you’d like to see from me?"
"Nothing different from what you’ve already shown." The major gestured to him. "While you display just enough intelligence, experience and initiative to substitute for Mr. Brandstad, there is one quality where you are more superior than him, and that’s resourcefulness."
"Ah, but I’m still unclear on what kind of resourcefulness you are looking for. How should I discharge my duties?"
The mech officer leaned forward on the conference table. "What I’m interested in is getting things done. Putting it simply, when you face a difficulty, you don’t give up or come crying to a more competent mech designer. Instead, you tackle it head on, and when you can’t figure out a conventional solution, you aren’t afraid to bend some rules and get things done through a different method."
Ves understood the major now. The Flagrant Vandals already worked under suboptimal circumstances compared to properly funded mech regiments. Now, they also got split up from the main fleet while they just completed a major operation. The task force had to work with less while doing more.
Someone who only thought in straight lines wasn’t suitable for the job. To keep the mechs of the task force together, the head designer needed to be a go-getter whose head was filled with crooked lines.
Ves didn’t know whether that was a good thing or bad thing.
At the end of the meeting where Verle thrust a new job onto Ves, Iris clapped his back with her slender hand and smiled.
"I’m sure you’re up to the task, Ves." The blond encouraged him. "No one else among the design team is as capable as you, whether we’re talking about design prowess or leadership ability."
"How do you know that?" He asked, feeling a bit suspicious for some reason.
"I’ve seen how you work. When you’re with the design teams, the work you do is head and shoulders above the other Apprentices. When you’re working with the mech technicians, you have this air around you that compels them to listen to you. These instances alone prove Major Verle’s point. There’s no one better among the task force that can play the role that a head designer needs to perform."
Ves shook his head and rested it on his palm. "Not you too. Not that I appreciate the compliments, but you are putting an awful lot of faith in me. I barely know what a head designer is supposed to be doing."
"Then maybe you should ask the professor if she isn’t calling you yet."
"Great idea. Can you tell me how it’s done with the VRF?"
Iris furrowed her brows. " Not really. We do things differently. I can tell you outright that we aren’t facing as much financial pressure. Sovvies and resources flow from our hands all the time in order to facilitate trade between the regional rebel movements. Instead, we grapple mostly with ensuring the loyalty of our external members."
Ves could see why the VRF struggled so much with such an issue. A rebel group as large as theirs probably hosted many different factions and sub-influences. Even if they outwardly stated that they fought to overthrow the Vesian system government, humans still possessed desires.
"Sounds like people management is a very big concern for your group. Since you mentioned external members, there should also be a more trusted class of members, right?"
"Yes, and they form the cadre of the Vesian Revolutionary Front. Some of them are even the descendants of the initial founders and revolutionaries of our group. Their loyalty to the cause is unassailable."
"What about those who enter into this circle later?"
"Oh, their loyalty is ironclad." Iris grinned in a self-confident manner. "There is no way they can become an internal member without proving their dedication. We may not be able to match our enemy’s military prowess, but when it comes maintaining unity, the nobles can’t compare to us."
Obviously, a rebel movement that continued to be a thorn in the side of the Vesian nobles for decades possessed quite a few means. Any other rebel group as large and prosperous as theirs would have fallen apart due to treachery and greed.
As Ves and Iris stepped out of the conference room, the guest designer freely revealed some of their inner workings.
"Overthrowing the feudal system is always a long-term effort in our eyes. The Kingdom has stood for hundreds of years and the institutional belief in in the system is difficult to shape. Only by ceaselessly laying the groundwork and waiting for the right opportunities do we stand a chance at destroying the perverse system of inheriting the right to rule."
"You sound really passionate about it. Is everyone in the VRF like you?"
"Our most passionate recruits comes from those who are directly scorned by the nobles." She spoke with little mirth. "The Kingdom might look firm and cohesive to you Brighters, but inside our walls the cracks are many, if you know what to look for. Recruits are everywhere to be found, though we mostly let the local rebels have the first pick. Many times, the grievances only extend to a single baron or count rather than the aristocracy as a whole."
"Hm, back in the Republic, we’re dealing with a similar sort of problem. I don’t think we have as much rebel groups as the Kingdom, but the Bentheim Liberation Movement possesses enough strength to match multiple of your movements."
"We know." She nodded. "In fact, the BLM is one of our fixed trading partners. They supply us with goods that are cheaper and more readily available in your Republic."
That caused Ves to falter in his steps. "What?! The VRF’s relationship with the BLM has grown to such an extent?!"
Iris suddenly realized that Ves might not be someone who harbored any sympathies for the Republic’s rebels. "I apologize, Ves. I’ve said something insensitive."
Against her frail form and her big eyes, Ves couldn’t hold it in him to resent her. "It’s okay, it’s just that the BLM are murderers and terrorists. They inflict a lot of suffering among the people who dwell in the Bentheim region. It’s like they get off on how many innocent civilians they can blow up at once."
The pair fell into an awkward silence. With regards to the VRF, they should ordinarily be aligned to the legitimate government of the Bright Republic. Both of them wanted the Vesia Kingdom to fall. They only disagreed on the extent to which the Kingdom should change.
Yet the VRF apparently sought to forge a relationship with the BLM. This could easily turn bad against the Vesians. If the VRF facilitated BLM’s campaigns, the most extreme outcome would insure that Rittersberg and Bentheim became two separate entities.
Once internal strife split the Bright Republic in half, the Vesia Kingdom would certainly pounce on them one by one.
Thus, leading to the end of Bentheim’s reign as an independent state within a couple of months.
The BLM’s success would not only weaken the Republic, it would also strengthen the Kingdom. The prestige of every noble would skyrocket when they won the war.
"The decision to work with the BLM is a high-level directive." Iris said. ""It can’t be changed on a whim. Only when our highest leaders get together can a change in policy turn into reality."
"Even rebels have to face the terrors of bureaucracy."
"That’s how it goes. As far as I’m concerned, we don’t differ too much from the legitimate authorities. The only difference is that they have the benefit of the law, even if that’s been twisted beyond recognition by a succession of nobles."
They finally reached a nondescript compartment that would be his next office. Ordinarily, the head designer resided on a logistics ship where most of the heavy lifting would be done.
Major Verle wanted Ves to remain aboard his flagship, though. Perhaps Verle wanted him close at hand, or perhaps he wanted to exert more control over his actions.
"So this is where I can find you when you’re on duty." Iris commented as they explored the tiny and cramped office cabin. It was barely larger than his sleeping cabin, and contained nothing that could facilitate the work of a head designer.
In fact, the office was completely empty.
"Looks like the first thing I need to do is head down to the Shield of Hispania’s workshop and fabricate my own furniture."
Iris crossed her arms and frowned at him. "Didn’t you listen to Major Verle? Don’t try to do everything yourself! Fabricating furniture is such a brain-dead job that any novice mech designer can do in their sleep. Heh, they can even leave the work to a mech technician."
"There’s no other mech designer aboard the Shield of Hispania, and I feel bad about nagging the chief technician over something trivial. I’d rather just do it myself."
When Ves turned around and walked towards the exit, Iris stopped him with a hand against his front. Her palm pressed against the fabric of his standard green mech designer uniform, where she could faintly feel the contours of his chest.
"Ehm..."
She quickly withdrew her hand before the moment became too awkward. "You’re wrong. You’re not the only mech designer on this ship. You still have me."
Ves blinked at Iris. He always regarded her as a visitor and a fellow peer. Even her origin as a Vesian began to fade in his consciousness once she assimilated in the design department.
"I’m not completely sure about that. You’re a guest designer as far as I’m aware of."
"That’s true. I answer to Professor Velten, but she’s not here now, isn’t she? I’m assigned to this task force as well, and while I’m not allowed to touch on the core secrets of the Vandals, I can still act as your assistant in many matters."
"I’ll have to look up the relevant regulations and consult with Professor Velten before I’m sure of what I’m allowed to do."
She held up her palm. "Ah ah ah! Stop right there, Ves, or should I say Head Designer Larkinson."
"Technically, it’s Temporary Head Designer Larkinson."
"As you say. The fact of the matter is that almost every mech of Major Verle’s task force needs a lot of servicing, and you can’t do it alone. Maybe you can call one of your buddies like Pierce to help you out, but he’s more useful at his current posting than as your gopher."
"So you are volunteering as my gopher instead?"
"This has nothing to do with volunteering. This is about necessity. You want to put the best people in the most demanding position." Iris spoke and threw him a teasing smile. "As for me, even though I’m just a guest designer, I can still lighten some of your burden. Don’t let idiotic regulations get in the way. Be resourceful and take me, sir."
Ves awkwardly coughed. For some reason, he felt this office grew a little stuffy. He felt as if he was being railroaded into this decision. That was not a good thing if he wanted to act as a leader.
Yet he couldn’t deny her suggestion in her face. Not outright, at least. "Alright. For now, there’s no harm in taking care of some of my matters. You can go ahead and furnish my office, but don’t work on my terminal."
"Understood, Mr. Larkinson."
To her credit, Iris didn’t contest that stipulation. Ves would be a fool to let a Vesian setup his computer terminal. She threw him a mock-salute before she hopped out of his empty office cabin.
Ves let out a huge breath in relief. Talking to Iris was like holding a rose. Even as she departed, Ves could still smell a whiff of her scent.
"Perfume is against regulations."
Not that any of the female Vandals adhered to that rule. Perhaps the message that Iris tried to convey had some merit.
Ves grew up among the Larkinsons for a time and visited them often to hear their tales. Throughout all their stories, the older Larkinsons stressed the importance of conducting themselves to the highest standard in the Mech Corps.
As a fairly renowned military dynasty in the Republic, the Larkinsons enjoyed a high reputation. That in turn meant that they would be subjected to a lot more scrutiny than usual. Every Larkinson in the Mech Corps had to be as straight-laced and faultless as they could be. The regulations existed for a reason, and every Larkinson needed to embody if not the letter, then at least the spirit of the rules.
"What a far cry the Flagrant Vandals are from those other mech regiments."
On one hand, Ves detested the sloppiness and corner-cutting that the lax enforcement fostered among the servicemen. On the other hand, Ves enjoyed the expanded autonomy. Now that circumstances thrust him in a position of actual authority, he finally felt somewhat free to determine his own course.
"This is what I always wanted. Even if I have to hand over this authority in a couple of months, the experience alone will add to my development as a mech designer."
It would also look good on his record. Once he proved his capabilities, another leadership position might fall into his lap in the future.
"I’m getting ahead of myself. My current job is difficult enough. Let’s see what the professor had to say."
Before the task force moved on to the next step of their journey, the Flagrant Vandals paused for a very important matter.
Space burial.
While the operation at the Detemen System yielded much success, the Vandals paid a substantial price for their gains.
Not only did the bombardment of Heavensfall missiles strike down two combat carriers and damage a couple of other vessels, several mech pilots lost their lives in direct combat. The loss of life among the spaceborn mech pilots was fairly light, but over fifty precious landbound mech pilots never left the surface alive.
Ves recalled the last stand of Lord Javier as he slowly filed into the solemn hangar bay. The scion of House Imodris lashed out without mercy, often choosing to slay the pilots inside the Vandal mechs. Such ruthlessness happened frequently on the battlefield. Not every mech offered a path to escape for their cockpits.
Simply by knocking a mech down onto their back, that mech’s ejection system became as useful as decoration. A cockpit simply couldn’t drill into the ground.
The Flagrant Vandals recovered very few complete remains when they policed the battle sites. Beneath the immortal glory of mech combat, the road for victors was often paid with cruel deaths and unimaginable suffering.
This was why mech pilots deserved respect. Ever since humanity heralded the Age of Mechs, they managed to turn warfare from a conflict that sowed trillions of lives to a more manageable level. The primary combatant consisted of mech pilots, and they shouldered the most risk of death.
Even auxiliary regiments suffered less casualties overall, as they would only be involved in very few conflicts, and strictly in a defensive capacity. Against the might of mechs, they also tended to rout very easily or surrender after getting their morale crushed.
In contrast, mech pilots venerated courage and displays of valiance. A pack of timid mech pilots that ejected prematurely possessed no spine to hold their ground or push through difficult fronts. Such soft-hearted policies saved more lives in the short-term, but lead to drastically more defeats in the long term.
What was the point of war if one side constantly ceded important objectives over a desire to minimize casualties?
Sacrifices needed to be made, and mech pilots offered themselves up as the sacrificial lambs.
Mech pilots needed to acquire the judgement to eject at the right moment, but some simply pulled the lever too late.
It was not that mech pilots ejected too late, but by the time they recognized their dire situation, they already passed the point of no return.
Many casualties among the mech pilots tended to fall into this category. The men and women that fell in the line of duty all possessed the courage to match a hero.
Thus, the ceremony concerning space burials was one of the most important rituals held by the Vandals, or any mech regiment for that matter.
Practically every serviceman aboard the Shield of Hispania attended the ceremony. They filed into ranks with sombre burgundy uniforms. Banners in the same color hung from bots that floated high above their heads. They displayed emblems of notable battles and major events in the course of the mech regiment’s existence.
Ves glanced at the ribbon-like banners hanging above and counted well-over thirty of them. That wasn’t bad for a mech regiment founded less than a century ago.
Only major battles fought at the scale of several mech companies to an entire mech regiment counted among their ranks. The more prestigious mech regiments such as the 1st Volari Starhawks of the 4th Bentheim Division boasted as much banners as the leaves of a tree. When such frontline regiments showed off their banners, the public would spontaneously descend to their knees.
Behind each banner rested a story. Behind each story rested the souls of fallen warriors. Not just mech pilots, but also those who serviced their mechs or kept the ships running.
Over a hundred metal casks rested in front of the hangar bay doors. All of them were covered by cloths with the emblem of the 6th. Only a small number of them contained complete and presentable corpses. Others held only portions, while many more held nothing at all.
Several high-quality recorders transmitted the ceremony to the other ships, while projectors beamed the virtual bodies of the Vandals aboard the other ships. This way, almost everyone in the task force would be able to witness the occasion without leaving their ships empty and vulnerable.
Since tens of thousands of Vandals had to fit inside the hangar bay, the size of the projected servicemen was four times smaller. This led to a fairly unusual sight where hundreds of adults stood among tens of thousands of ’children’.
The lack of space in the hangar bay necessitated such a change. No one wanted to miss the space burial.
The time for the ceremony arrived. Major Verle stepped forward while holding the folded banner of the Detemen Operation. Everyone up close got a good look at the emblem, while those standing further back could look at the central projection above their heads.
The emblem consisted of two planets orbiting over twin stars. One star glowed red while the other glowed yellow. The planets didn’t look like circles, but instead adopted complex shapes.
The symbol that stood for Detemen II resembled a rod-shaped crystal that glowed like the sun. It showed a lot of cracks.
The symbol for Detemen IV resembled a bleeding planet that was being bombarded by a trio of asteroids.
Once Major Verle reached a procession of guards, he handed over the banner to someone in a fancy uniform. The guard then proceeded to affix the banner onto a waiting bot and commanded it to fly the banner over the metal caskets.
A Vandal began to step forward as well and brought a trumpet to her lips. She started to play a solemn, lonesome tune.
The major stepped onto a small stage. "Men and women of the 6th Flagrant Vandals. It saddens me to see that there are less of you than before. I see a few new faces among you, but many older faces now rest in these lifeless coffins."
Several side projections appeared that displayed the portraits of the fallen. All of their faces looked dignified, as if they had already anticipated that they might one day be honored by a ceremony like this.
Some Vandals even broke out in silent tears as they gazed at the faces of lifelong friends and comrades that they always trusted to cover their backs.
In the meantime, Major Verle never stopped speaking.
"We are only human. Our mortality is our strongest nature. The drive to survive is the ultimate catalyst of our short-lived race. Through the revelry of combat, we experience ecstacy and fragility of life. Only in the heat of the moment do we touch upon a truth in the galaxy: water tastes the sweetest when you are thirsty. For mech pilots like us, our thirst for battle can only be quenched by the flames of war."
Ves looked at the faces that scrolled by in the side projections. Alloc’s name and face remained absent in the rotation, which caused him to relax for just a bit.
That did not mean that chances were high that Alloc managed to survive. His status was ambiguous, and would continue to be marked as such for several more years even if he never showed his face again.
Some part of Ves believed that Alloc deserved a place among the fallen. He hated himself for thinking that way, and suppressed the thought immediately.
"We call ourselves the Flagrant Vandals with pride. Do you know why? Because we laugh at the face of death! If the endless embrace of the unknown wishes to drag us in their depths, we will not cry in despair, but fight its grasp with smiles on our faces. That is what a Vandal ought to do!"
A thrum of pride and acceptance swept throughout the crowd. No matter if they attended with their real or projected bodies, everyone appeared to resonate with Major Verle’s words. Even Ves became swept in the esprit de corps on display here.
For a moment, Ves felt as if he was an authentic member of the Flagrant Vandals. His back thrust a little straighter and his chest lifted a little higher.
"The stars belong to humanity, and humanity belongs to the stars. Our life begins and ends from the nutrients provided by the stars. So we shall send the vessels of our fallen to the star of this Vesian star system. I can find no greater honor than to be buried in the territory of our enemies. Is it not preferable to being buried in a boring system back home?!"
"No!" Everyone thundered in unison.
Ves visibly felt the vibration of the deck from so many people speaking at once!
"This is the way of the Flagrant Vandals! We cheat, we plunder, we steal from our enemies, even in death! No Vesian shall bar our way! If we are hungry, we take their food! If we’re short on mechs, we steal their machines! If we need more spending money, we will take their hard-earned sovvies from their feeble hands!"
For some reason, everyone stamped their left foot in unison. The entire hangar bay rang from the echoes of that one single step. Only a handful of newcomers like Ves remained transfixed with both feet on the deck.
"The end of their lives is the beginning of the new one. No matter whether you believe in god, science or aliens, life is too precious to be snuffed out after a single lifetime. Let us send these coffins off to help our fallen comrades on their way to the next step of their journey."
A moment of silence fell shortly after. Major Verle and every other Vandal saluted the caskets of the fallen. It wasn’t appropriate for mech designers like Ves and Iris to salute, so they simply stood in a stiffened posture.
The trumpet played on for a minute or so, but ended right after. At this moment, absolute silence fell upon the hangar bay. Besides the ambient noise from a ship that floated in space, Ves heard nothing else.
Ves did not feel any oppression or awkwardness in this silence. Everyone showed tribute to the fallen and turned their thoughts to what the deceased might face next now that their life in this universe came at an end.
To think of their departure as an ending sounded depressing. It was easier to accept that the lives of the comrades that they would never see again would be smiling as they reached the next stop of their lives. Perhaps one of two might even look back and wave at the Vandals gathered here today in unison.
Once two minutes had passed, another guard stepped up to Major Verle and presented a simple device to the officer. Verle inputted a code and pulled a small lever.
The entire hangar bay vibrated a little bit as the hangar bay doors slid open. A security screen was all that stood in the way between the interior of the hangar bay and total vacuum outside.
Of course, in the event of an accident, many other invisible safeguards would spring into action.
The caskets began to hover above the deck and slide through the security screen one by one. Miniature antigrav modules gave the caskets enough of a push to sling away from the Shield of Hispania.
They would slowly begin their trek towards the inner system. Their journey only ended when the star at the center of the system swallowed them up.
Some of these caskets faced a perilous journey. Perhaps a few errant asteroids or particles knocked them off-course along their journey. Accidents happened. That was part of life. A space burial didn’t necessarily lead to the boundary of a star.
Once every casket floated away, the hangar bay doors slowly slid shut. Major Verle departed through a hatch and everyone started to relax and speak with each other in low tones. No one smiled, but those who cried felt no need to cry.
Ves thought his concept of life underwent a subtle sublimation. "The end of a life is a new beginning."
The space burial served as a pivotal event which affected every Vandal among the Verle Task Force. Like a seed buried amidst the fertilizers of the fallen, a new life sprung into being.
"A new beginning."
Those words echoed throughout everyone’s minds. Ves never imagined that Major Verle could be so eloquent. A speechwriter among his staff must have composed those uplifting and inspiring words.
After Ves took a mental step back, he realized the eulogy aimed to invigorate the Vandals. The last thing they needed was people getting hung up about the losses they sustained.
As a soldier of the Republic, they weren’t soft-hearted to the extent that the death of a comrade plunged them into despair.
Yet human emotion was a complex beast, and all manner of negative thoughts might bloom in the darkness.
Verle’s speech served as a light that banished that darkness and guided the thoughts of his subordinates to a more beneficial direction. The underlying message instructed them to cast away the shackles of the past and look towards a new beginning,
The act of plunging the caskets into space during the space burial could therefore be seen as a dividing line between the past and the present.
Right now, it was more important for the Verle Task Force to shake off Vesian pursuit and escape the Kingdom’s borders. The Vesians must be incredibly furious at the daring act of striking at the heart of their territory. Only by butchering the guilty party would they be able to cleanse their shame!
This hounding threat provided the motivation while the space burial gave the Vandals the impetus to pick up their work. Their productivity soared as they pushed all thoughts of mourning the dead aside in order to deal with the present crisis.
Ves arrived at his furnished office the next day. The cabin received a clean but luxurious makeover that wouldn’t look out of place from a cruise ship. Stylish metal furniture marked with green and brass motifs gave the entire cabin a sense that only the most distinguished gentlemen worked in this office.
"This is a bit too much." He spoke after he took in the sight.
"You’re the boss now. You have to show that off. A barebones office won’t do." Iris spoke from the side.
The cabin was kind of cramped, as was typical to ships where space came at a premium. Despite that limitation, Iris somehow managed to divide the interior in a way that squeezed in a desk and terminal for her as well.
Evidently, she wanted to work in the same room as Ves.
"I’ll go fabricate some terminals." He said. "For now, please make contact with the staff aboard the Shield of Hispania. I can probably pull up some official reports from the terminal once its up, but it helps if you can tell me their impressions and overall opinions."
"I can do that, but be aware that I’m a guest aboard this ship. They won’t tell me anything critical."
"That’s okay. If I need to know about something, they’ll pay me a visit or send me some classified documents on their own initiative."
After packing Iris off, Ves went down to the nearest workshop to fabricate some terminals and other high-tech gadgets to make his office complete. This was something he needed to do by himself in order to insure that nobody tampered with his equipment. It was a lot harder to detect irregularities if someone tampered with it during the fabrication process.
Ves didn’t go for anything fancy when he arrived at a 3D printer. He selected the most reliable and impenetrable models available in its database and made some minor tweaks before letting the device do all the work. He didn’t even need to intervene in the production process due to the limited amount of variables at play.
Once the 3D printer spat out all of the gear he needed, he ordered a bot to bring them to his office. Ves accompanied the bot as they climbed the deck and supervised the installation process to insure nothing fudged the equipment.
After realizing that he’d been way too sloppy with regards to information security back at Detemen IV, Ves became way more paranoid about this matter. While he couldn’t match Alloc’s prowess in this area, his rapid study session back then boosted his Computer Science Skill to a respectable level, so he wasn’t as clueless as before.
Once the bots left the office, Ves withdrew a multiscanner attached to his toolbelt and carefully scanned every nook and cranny of his office. He paid special attention to the furniture, but the device detected no anomalies.
Though the cabin did include some very covert monitoring devices, Ves quickly figured out that they were connected to the core systems of the Hispania. In other words, they formed part of the combat carrier’s integrated security systems.
To be certain, Ves sent a quick message to the security department of the ship. They immediately confirmed guess, so Ves had to leave the bugs alone.
Obviously, no part of the ships escaped monitoring. Everyone was subjected to observation, but just because they came under scrutiny, didn’t mean that someone would act on what the bugs recorded.
Ves keenly remembered treasonous talk among the spacers of the Wolf Mother. That they could get away with that talk meant that the Vandals didn’t care too much about small offenses. Even talk of gambling, drinking and fraternization was met with silence.
This absence of action obviously meant that the Vandals couldn’t be bothered with trivialities. As long as the spacers did their job, who cared if they broke over a dozen regulations of the Mech Corps.
"I could probably get away with many things." He figured.
That didn’t mean it was wise to test the boundaries of what was possible. When you walked close to the river, your shoes would eventually get wet.
Still, Ves hadn’t even formally started his job, but his mind already swirled with temptation. The job of head designer sounded very impressive, and Ves guessed he could turn a lot of things to his advantage if he wished.
"That’s probably a bad idea right now."
His goal for the time being was fairly simple right now. He merely wanted to survive the current peril and make it through the war alive. Any benefits beyond this came as an extra.
Thus, after settling his momentary greed, he calmed down and became sober. Even the enviable amount of power that came with the position of head designer didn’t excite him anymore. To him, the job was just another burden.
A few minutes later, Ves locked down the office and contacted Professor Velten. Unlike Ves and Iris, most of the other high-ranking mech designers stayed with Colonel Lowenfield’s fleet. The distance separating Lowenfield’s fleet and Major Verle’s task force ranged at least a dozen light-years.
To put that into perspective, it took at least twelve years for a conventional signal sent from one end to the other end.
Nonetheless, communicating with the other fleet happened instantly and seamlessly as long as both sides had access to quantum entanglement nodes.
One of the most basic privileges of a head designer was that they enjoyed expanded privileges when it came to accessing the galactic net and contacting others among the Vandals.
His terminal lit up as a projection of Professor Velten’s face came into being. Though she looked dour most of the time, Ves immediately spotted something different.
The Professor’s eyes were red, and her skin gained a lot of extra wrinkles. Already senile, the Senior Mech Designer had obviously aged substantially in a matter of weeks!
"Ah, professor, I, uh, am I calling at a bad time?"
"No." She replied hoarsely but with inner strength. Despite her outward appearance, she sounded as firm as a rock. "Our duties must go on. We cannot afford to rest while thousands are depending on us."
The professor obviously mourned for Alloc. Ves learned from his that he was actually the professor’s legacy disciple. Alloc was her final protégé, and one who would inherit most of her knowledge and possessions after she passed away.
In the mech industry, the bond between a mentor and a mentee came in many forms. Most of the times, the relationship was shallow and transactional. The mentor taught their student some of their knowledge, while the student toiled for the mentor or paid them something of value.
Naturally, more intimate relationships existed as well. To someone like Velten who benefited from a round of life-prolonging treatment, familial bonds often faded away. Mechs became her family, and the mech designers she nurtured substituted for her own offspring.
Like any parent, a mentor with a deep affection for their student never wished for them to perish before their time was up. The pain that came with this loss was heart-wrenching torture.
Ves suspected that if Velten’s lifespan had just been cut in half at the very least. She wasn’t very long for this universe. Once she died, the Flagrant Vandals lost their last remaining Senior Mech Designer. The consequences would certainly be very dire if the Vandals failed to get a replacement.
He minutely shook his head. That was for Colonel Lowenfield to worry about. Ves needed to focus on the problems that fell within his scope as a head designer of the task force.
Ves patiently waited for Velten to get a grip on her emotions. After she regained some clarity in her mind, she turned her attention to him. "Mr. Larkinson, why are you calling me? You don’t possess the privilege to make an intersystem call!"
"Ah, don’t you remember? With Alloc’s absence, I’ve become the temporary head designer of Major Verle’s task force."
He waited for several seconds as the professor’s foggy mind processed his words. Frankly, that she forgot about his field promotion was inexcusable. Ves tactfully refrained from recommending that Velten should visit the infirmary and get her head checked.
A light finally switched on in her head. "Ah! I recall now. This is a highly irregular course of action, but the position of head designer cannot remain empty. Even if you lack the qualifications and experience to take up this position, I trust you will not be too inept at your new job."
"I’m still uncertain what my temporary job entails, ma’am. I’ve only heard vague descriptions so far and nobody sent me any instructions."
"Oh, I forgot to send you the relevant documents. Let me transfer them to you now. I highly recommend you peruse them all, but make sure you do not leak out the contents of the classified documents. I don’t have to tell you what the consequences are if you are caught with spilling sensitive information."
His terminal beeped upon receipt of a whole pile of virtual documents. Ves skimmed over the files and saw that it included a large assortment of lists, budgets, manuals and schedules. This probably served as his foundation for his new job.
"Let me explain the role of head designer to you in the simplest terms." She began. "A head designer is a mech designer that is the foremost expert among the fleet or task force. This is the most essential criteria, and for this job to land on an Apprentice Mech Designer is highly unusual. In fact, it is unprecedented in the Mech Corps."
In other words, Ves needed to fill some very big shoes.
"I have one question, ma’am. Why not let one of your Journeymen act as your head designer in remote? Even if they aren’t physically present in the task force, they can still perform just as well."
The professor shook her head. "This has been done many times, to mixed success. We do not have the right policies and training in place to accomplish such a thing. Physical presence is important. This is why the galaxy hasn’t turned into a giant virtual playground where every human is immersed in a permanent tank and interacts with the outside universe through a robot avatar. Humans are very social creatures. A close presence is essential in controlling an expansive organization."
Ves wouldn’t be able to fob off the job to someone else, then. The professor was right that Ves probably held the most qualifications to wear this hat, even if it was too big to fit snugly on his head right now.
"The buck stops with you." Professor Velten stated to Ves over the channel. "Don’t let anyone else dictate the mech composition of the task force. Every single mech company must match the specifications set by you. In fact, if you strongly believe you are right, you may even disregard my instructions!"
Ves almost became floored after she said that. Though he knew that the professor was fallible, he still couldn’t fathom why he should reject her instructions. Her wisdom as a Senior far outclassed his limited perspective as an Apprentice.
"Why should I trust my own judgement over yours?"
"You’re the man on the ground, as it were. I am far away from the task force, and the distance will only widen with time. Even if I can gather all manner of information through the quantum entanglement node, it is dangerous to transmit so much sensitive data over a distance. As the mech designer who is closer to the action, the information and impressions at your disposal exceeds my own."
"How far can I go with this, professor?"
"As far as you want to. You’re the head designer, remember?" She sent a brief smile to him. "I am not in the habit of micromanaging my subordinates. Though I am not as familiar with you as Alloc, your record and the capabilities that you have shown has given me enough confidence that you can fulfill your duties to the minimum extent. As long as the mechs of the task force aren’t falling apart, you will have the leeway to structure their mech composition as much as you like."
"That’s... a lot more extensive than I thought. Isn’t it dangerous to put so much decision-making power at my disposal, ma’am?"
She shook her head. "You are but one cog in a great machine. A head designer never works in isolation. If the mech designers under your command think you are making a drastic mistake, they’ll work to obstruct you in many ways. While you can arrest them and throw them into the brig if they become a thorn at your side, you’ll lose a valuable resource that way. You can’t possibly arrest every mech designer."
Less than ten high-ranking mech designers accompanied the task force. All of them including Ves, Iris and Pierce participated in the development of the core designs of the Flagrant Vandals. Their mastery and depth of knowledge was crucial in solving complicated problems.
Ves couldn’t afford to fall out with his former peers.
"There are also the main institutions of the Flagrant Vandals. You have the line officers which mostly encompass the mech officers such as Major Verle and the various mech captains that lead their companies into battle. As the people closest to the action, they are burdened with the responsibility of shepherding their mech pilots through thick and thin. Their approval is essential for any plans you might have in store."
That made sense. If Ves turned crazy one day and insisted every mech in the task force replace their armor with pig iron, then he would instantly be beset with mutiny among the mech pilots. Major Verle himself may even barge into his cabin at night and butcher him in his sleep!
Ves shivered a bit. "I understand, ma’am. I’ll be sure to take their opinions into account."
"The line officers care most about the specs and the concrete fighting capabilities of their mechs. These are highly trained mech commanders who wants what is best for their men regardless of the cost. However, the Flagrant Vandals aren’t in a position where we can disregard our budgetary concerns."
"Good mechs tend to be expensive."
"Exactly, Mr. Larkinson. Keep in mind our current circumstances. We are knee-deep behind enemy lines, with not a single safe harbor in sight. The nearest neutral star system is months away. Acquiring the right materials is a challenge under these conditions is a challenge in itself."
Ves knew that to maintain a thousand mechs required an ungodly amount of materials. Though the Vandals looted a lot of valuables from the Detemen System, they prioritized the most valuable materials instead of the most relevant materials to maintain the mechs they currently fielded.
It was like a hungry man robbing a luxury handcrafted bag store. The robber may have come into possession of valuable bags, but that wouldn’t satisfy his hunger!
This pretty much described the current state of Major Verle’s task force.
"This is a lot of work." Ves frowned. "There should be others who are responsible with procurement, right?"
"That is correct. The staff officers are responsible for logistics and more. Most relevant for you is that they keep track of what the task force currently lacks and draw up plans to replenish any shortages. They also maintain relations with the VRF. In your current condition, you should lean on them to initiate trades with the rebel group. Within enemy space, only they can quench the task force’s thirst for essential resources."
Ves felt as if a boulder lifted off his shoulders. He would truly tear his hair out if he needed to be responsible for supplying resources as well.
"So I need to work together with logistics to supply the task force with the materials to repair and maintain their mechs, right?"
"That is correct. They favor their own priorities, of course. The planners in charge of resource management wish to expend as little money or resources as possible. Their desire for efficiency grossly outweighs any other concerns. In truth, if not for their tireless efforts in maximizing every possible means at our disposal, the Flagrant Vandals might have long gone insolvent."
Back when Ves worked at the Wolf Mother, Professor Velten assigned him to the planning department for some time. Back then, he thought that the professor merely wanted someone sensible to act as a liaison between the logistics officers and the mech technicians, but now he realized that the professor was a lot more farsighted than he thought.
Did she nurture him for this role beforehand? Even as a contingency, the professor could never imagine that he needed to take on the role of head designer so soon!
Still, reality never cooperated with anyone, and Ves got thrust into the job long before he was ready to take on this responsibility. The brief amount of time he spent in the core of the Wolf Mother exposed him to the perspective of the logistics officers whose job was to make sure that every ship and every mech received adequate supplies.
Whether the professor deliberately groomed him or not, that exposure filled up a critical hole in his experience, thereby rounding out vision so that he could encompass everyone’s perspective!
Though this did not bolster his confidence too much, he at least felt some reassurance that he wasn’t working alone on the problems plaguing the task force.
The professor pointed something out to him. "Major Verle will have a staff at his disposal that leads the various sections of his command. One of them is certainly responsible for logistics, so that is your first contact point if you need to acquire specific resources."
"Understood."
"As you can see, the role of the head designer doesn’t necessarily entail any hands-on design work. Maybe you feel that a critical job can only be performed correctly by you, but I advise you not to intervene in person too often. Your time is better spent on the primary task of your position, which is to act as the coordinator that brings different parties together to insure that they have the appropriate mechs on hand for their next missions."
In truth, being a mech designer wasn’t necessary to act as a coordinator. It only helped with making the right judgement in drawing up the task force’s mech composition.
If someone changed the job name from head designer to mech coordinator, anyone could perform this job really, though they needed to be proficient in many technical matters.
"There is one more responsibility that you should take note of. Are you aware that there is an expert mech pilot attached to your task force?"
"Ah, yes, ma’am. I was there when Major Verle asked Venerable O’Callahan to deploy. The venerable... refused."
The professor sighed and grunted in frustration. "That stubborn old coot! Venerable O’Callahan is a special individual. He has his eccentricities. In truth, his relationship with the Vandals is less than stellar. Rather than a comrade, he is more of a mercenary of sorts."
In other words, Venerable O’Callahan was only a member of the Flagrant Vandals in name. Having heard his story, Ves knew that the expert mech pilot bounced around in the Bright Republic and the Friday Coalition before being kicked to the Vandals.
O’Callahan was undeniably an expert mech pilot. However, much like Professor Velten, the man went through a botched life-prolonging treatment. Combined with the fact that he was as old as the professor and that his growth potential had long been exhausted, nobody really valued him anymore.
It was no wonder the man degenerated into a cynical old bastard. Not every venerable lived up to their title.
A feeling of dread crept up to his body. "Do I need to be responsible for O’Callahan as well?"
"In short, yes. To be more exact, you are responsible for the upkeep of his custom mech. Every expert mech pilot in a mech regiment is accompanied by his own personal design team. You haven’t met them before, but with your recent elevation to head designer, they answer to you as well."
"I take it that maintaining a custom mech is not very easy."
The professor smiled awkwardly to Ves. "I’m sure you’re familiar with the saying that you get what you paid for. Behind the eye-dazzling performance of expert mechs, there is an enormous cost. To put the burden into perspective, a mech fit for an expert pilots cost as much as a combat carrier to build and maintain."
Ves wanted to puke when he heard the sum involved with maintaining a single mech. Even the Lord Javier’s Loquacious Raphael wasn’t that perverse!
"How... bad is the problem?"
"You do not have to take care of the design of his lancer mech. This is my own duty, and the responsibility to modify the mech to my latest iteration lies with O’Callahan’s design team." She answered.
It would have been ridiculous if Ves needed to takeover the design of an expert on his own.
"Nonetheless, O’Callahan can be... demanding. The custom mech I’ve designed for him does not adhere to any single design. In actual fact, I’ve developed and maintained over twenty different variants of the same design. Each of them differ in minor ways to accommodate different environments, counters, cost and resource demands."
"Some variants are more powerful than others." Ves ventured out a guess. "Of course, the best is also the most expensive."
The professor nodded. "Venerable O’Callahan wants the best of the best. He has made that very clear to me and every mech designer that he has worked with for years. When he doesn’t get his way... there is little we can do to compel him to follow orders."
An expert mech pilot was a demigod among men. Even a cranky grandpa like O’Callahan received the worship and veneration of the rank and file. From the stories of the Larkinsons, Ves knew that all of this hero worship tended to inflate the heads of expert mech pilots to a ridiculous degree.
"So when it comes down to it, I’m indirectly tasked with managing our only expert mech pilot’s ego."
"You must carefully balance the needs of Venerable O’Callahan with the needs of the rest of the task force. However, no matter what you decide, you cannot afford to neglect either of them. Your escape from Vesian space depends on both numbers and quality."
Perhaps this was the most challenging and essential responsibility on his shoulders. Ves realized that managing O’Callahan formed the critical factor in keeping the mechs of the task force going. If he screwed it up entirely, their chances of escaping the Kingdom and completing their next mission would drop to nil.
The Verle Task Force transitioned back into FTL immediately after the space burial. They needed to leave the vicinity of the Detemen System as soon as possible in order to throw off pursuit.
In truth, the caskets thrown out into space for the space burial might easily be detected by any scouts that entered this system. Ves guessed that Major Verle wasn’t stupid enough to leave behind some breadcrumbs without a good reason. Perhaps there was a deliberate element of strategy here.
"I don’t think anyone in the Kingdom expected your Vandal fleet to split up." Iris explained when she saw his puzzlement. "It’s even more perplexing that this task force is heading in the opposite direction."
At the very least, it would scramble the defense forces of the Kingdom and force them to split their focus, but only up to a certain extent.
Each fief in the Kingdom hosted their own separate defense forces. Each noble House maintained their own garrison fleets that ordinarily guarded important star systems, but they were not above combining their forces and pursuing an intruding element like the Vandals passing through their domains.
Of course, each House eyed each other warily, so they wouldn’t easily team up. Not even the royals possessed that much power. Even the Mech Legion couldn’t resist being fractured by the competition between powerful interest groups.
"How dangerous will it be to sneak this task force to the Reinald border?" Ves asked.
"Very challenging." Iris said. "We managed to breeze through their territories because we successfully hid our presence. That’s no longer an option."
"Your VRF can’t keep hiding us?"
"Not when the entire Kingdom is alarmed and out for our blood. We’re close to the heart of their Kingdom. There is no way the Vesian nobles will tolerate our escape. They’ll deploy much more probes to the surrounding star systems. The rebel groups aligned with us can obfuscate some of the probes, but it’s impossible to catch them all."
After some clarification, Iris explained that the VRF would only be able to keep their journey hidden at some points along their route. There were still many desolate star systems within the border of the Kingdom, but the odds of detection when transitioning out of FTL was roughly thirty percent.
"So one times out of three, the task force’s presence is passed on to the Vesians. While that wouldn’t be sufficient to catch up on us, they can make a good guess where we will transition to next and prepare enough ships to greet our arrival with a storm of fire."
"The odds of guessing our next destination shouldn’t be easy." Ves pointed out. "There’s dozens of potential destinations with each hop in our journey. Also, it’s impossible for those selfish Houses to volunteer their valuable defense forces to clash against us wholeheartedly."
What benefit would they receive if they hindered the formidable task force? A force that consisted of half a mech regiment was no joke. Even though they split their mech compliment between spaceborn mechs and landbound mechs, not every noble House can conjure up hundreds of mechs at the snap of their fingers.
"You’re right about that. Much of the Kingdom’s military strength is transferred to the frontlines. With the absence of first-rate mech divisions and mech regiments, what’s left behind are second-rate defense and garrison troops. They play a vital role in the defense of critical infrastructure. The moment that someone redirects these forces to somewhere else, the VRF will instantly instigate the local rebel groups to strike their defenseless assets."
In a way, this was an open conspiracy between the VRF and the noble Houses. Even if they wished to fight for the glory of taking down the intruders that brazenly raided the Detemen System, they couldn’t afford to sustain any damage to their industries and defensive installations.
"Still, it’s hard to believe that the Vesians don’t have any large mobile assets available to defend their own territory. Or else, any random pirate swarm could have wreaked havoc within their borders."
It sounded too stupid if that was the case. The Vesia Kingdom stood stable for hundreds of years, and grew up alongside the Bright Republic that would have pounced on this weakness.
"That’s the most dangerous part in our escape. The Mech Legion hasn’t sent all of their mech divisions to the frontlines. Every duchy is still in the process of mobilizing their mech forces. Even if their mech divisions are incomplete, they can easily overwhelm our task force if they managed to catch up to us."
The premise here was that they could catch up to the Vandals at all. Splitting up the divisions into regiments or smaller allowed them to cast a wider net. However, the Vandals could easily pierce through a net that was spread too wide.
Basically, it all came down to luck and probability. Ves guessed that they would probably get caught a few times along their two-month journey to the Reinald Republic.
Ves summed up the task force’s predicament. "It’s as if we are playing a game. Each new turn, we get to take a step forward, but we also have to roll a dice. If our luck is good, nothing will happen."
When their luck took a bad turn, the task force might need to fight their way out. Battle was inevitable.
"Thus, it’s important for you to get your act together, Ves. A head designer isn’t just a figurehead. It’s a position that demands tough decision-making. A critical oversight might lead to bad matchups in the coming battles! The lives of hundreds of mech pilots are at your mercy!"
Iris might have exaggerated a little, but Ves did wield enough influence over mech policy to affect the outcome of any battles during this period. Even if he maintained the status quo, that was also a decision in itself that may attract some blame to him if a battle went south.
At his first day of work, Ves needed to get apprised to current status of the mech companies under his purview. Naturally, Ves wouldn’t be able to call up a convenient System-like Status page for every mech company, so he needed to do things the old-fashioned way.
He read. He read a lot. Major Verle’s ships had a four-day journey ahead of themselves before they arrived at the next star system, so Ves spent almost every hour getting up to date.
In the meantime, he issued a broad instruction for every mech company to perform repairs at their own judgement. He only added an extra instruction to channel most of their available manpower and resources to fixing up their spaceborn mechs. Without the strength to contest in space, the task force could forget about escaping Vesian space.
For his reading marathon, Ves first tackled the welcome package sent by Professor Velten. Some of it contained regulations that reiterated the points in their discussion, but in more exact and official terms.
The most important point was that a head designer still fell outside the chain of command. Nothing changed in that matter. Ves wouldn’t be able to point to a random crew member aboard the Shield of Hispania and order them around.
In practice, this meant that his scope was wide, but his actual authority was more nebulous. If he couldn’t convince the mech officers and the staff officers that his decisions benefited the Vandals, they would be free to treat his words as air.
"This isn’t very different from my days as an entrepreneur." He snorted. "The only thing that’s different is that my customers have changed. Before, I tried to sell my mechs to the market. Now, I have to sell my proposals to a single customer."
In truth, the Flagrant Vandals didn’t consist of a single ’customer’ per se. Though a mech regiment imposed a high level of standardization, every mech company performed a different role. Besides distinguishing themselves as spaceborn or landbound units, they also pursued a broad specialization, such as scouting, defense or assault.
After reading the mountain of regulations, Ves dove into the nitty gritty of the Flagrant Vandals. He not only read through Velten’s summary, he also dove into the databases to make his own investigations.
A clear picture started to form in his mind.
As a rule, the Vandals really liked to raid. Their spaceborn assets leaned towards lighter mechs and most of their mechs fulfilled some sort of offensive role. Their defensive capability was frankly piss-poor.
"We don’t have a lot of knights or rifleman mechs on our rosters."
This presented a fairly substantial hole in their mech lineup. The Flagrant Vandals only excelled at a limited variety of mission profiles. Once they performed a mission out of their element, their strength took a nosedive.
From another perspective, the Vandals acted like a sharp and silent dagger. A large proportion of their combat carriers and mechs were quite fast, and could appear in unexpected locations with ease. Once an enemy detected their presence, they could either strike hard and fast or scurry away like cowardly rats.
"We’re basically a one-trick pony."
This deliberate direction enabled the Vandals to become very good at what they did. It also earned them a decent amount of efficiency compared to a balanced mech regiment. Mech pilots could easily transfer between different mech models that performed the same role, and mech technicians were highly familiar on how to tweak the mechs to bring out their strengths.
Mechs that performed similar roles also used up the same broad pool of material types. For example, a knight mech design mainly utilized dense alloys, while a skirmisher mech exclusively made use of lightweight alloys.
Plenty of exceptions existed of course, but light and skinny medium mechs were responsible for the bulk of the task force’s resource demands.
This emphasis tremendously eased the logistical burden of the Vandals. Rather than drawing up smaller amounts from a large pool of material types, they instead drew up larger amounts from a more limited pool.
It was like the difference between someone eating a varied diet of food and a crazy person that predominantly ate eggs. While the latter person also ate some fruit, vegetables and meat, but it was to such a small extent that they barely played a role.
After analyzing the task force’s mech lineup from the perspective of the line officers and staff officers, he turned his attention to the giant anomaly in their midst.
"The professor wasn’t kidding that maintaining an expert pilot costs as much as a combat carrier!"
The abundant amount of money in the form of resources spent on upkeep, repairs and overhauls easily surpassed several billion credits on an annual basis.
Even a normal mech regiment would have a heart attack if they wished to support an extra expert pilot!
This black hole in their roster and budget swallowed so many resources that even the Vandals couldn’t bear the expenditure. Digging a little further into the database, Ves found out that the Vandals actually retained two expert pilots!
"They’re already in the red for supporting one expert pilot. Adding another is straining their budget to the bursting point!"
The dire financial position of the Vandals could partially be attributed on their insistence in supporting two expert pilots. Some mech regiments outright went without any expert pilots because they couldn’t find any or bear the cost of upkeep!
Naturally, the saying that you got what you paid for also applied in this case. An expert pilot paired with a supremely built expert mech formed a very powerful spearhead that could be sent to accomplish the impossible.
For someone like Venerable O’Callahan, fighting one against hundred wasn’t out of the question.
"At least it’s a good thing that he’s piloting a spaceborn mech."
O’Callahan piloted a lancer mech, which was basically a spearman mech with a flight system. His mech excelled in duels where its lance could chew up any enemy mech in its way with a single charge. The only demerit to this mode of combat was that he couldn’t eliminate mechs in a group.
"That should be another deliberate choice." Ves mused. "The regular Vandals can take care of the cannon fodder. O’Callahan should only be brought out when the enemy threatens our rank-and-file with elites."
The Venerable’s lancer mech could also be converted into an aerial mech that was suitable to operating within the gravity well of a planet. The conversion process demanded a lot of time and resources, though, so the switch needed to be done well in advance.
All in all, the mechs of the task force appeared to be very strong in writing. However, Ves also spotted the cracks while riding between the lines.
The official reports and summaries painted a fairly rosy picture of the mechs he needed to take care of. Even a three-year old child could spot that the people who wrote these reports tried to paint themselves in the the most favorable light.
They might not be telling outright lies, but there were many ways someone could massage a report. Ves did it plenty of times in school when an assignment was due but hadn’t spent enough time in his studies.
Fortunately, very few of the people who wrote the reports had mastered the dark arts of bureaucracy, so Ves easily deduced their transparent attempts.
By and large, most mech captains demanded more or better resources. Both of these demands came with different benefits. Allocating more resources to their units allowed them to bounce back faster after sustaining losses. Raising their allowance better resources allowed them to upgrade their mechs.
Some mech companies wanted to build up a deeper reserve. Others wanted to raise the overall quality of their mech roster. The greediest mech companies even begged for both.
Fortunately, the mech captains already got used to being rejected. No matter how much they whined, the people in charge of procurement and resource management couldn’t conjure materials out of thin air.
Still, the constant exaggerations in the reports made it difficult for Ves to get a true picture of their current state. Ves needed to dig beyond that and study individual maintenance reports and such to get at the heart of the matter.
This was extremely tedious work. A regular person needed months to process all of the documents. They not only needed to pick the most relevant files to read, they also had to recognize the most relevant data and interpret them into useful information.
Leaving the work aside to AIs provided unreliable conclusions, because Ves quickly realized the raw data had been fudged as well.
"It doesn’t take that much volume to replace a chest plate."
The AIs hadn’t been trained to pick up these subtle irregularities in the data. Even an average mech designer wouldn’t be able to spot the differences, because they often skirted around the margin of error.
Basically, it was as if Ves told a kid to purchase lunch for himself. The kid runs to a sandwich store and then comes back to Ves to tell him that it costs 2 credits for a sandwich. Ves had no reason to doubt this price, so he casually transfers the credits to the kid, who proceeded to buy his lunch.
In actual fact, the kid hadn’t been entirely accurate when he reported the price. The sandwich actually cost 1.99 credits, which amounted to a discrepancy of 0.5 percent.
"A loss of half a percent isn’t much in normal circumstances." Ves determined. "But at the scale the Vandals are working with, it’s a serious problem."
Nobody cared about this problem if it happened in a low-level situation such a kid trying to fool their parents. The parents only lost 0.01 credits, which was an absolute pittance to even the poorest citizens of the Republic.
Mech regiments operated at a scale of billions of credits. The upkeep of a standard mech company that consisted of forty active mechs and twenty or so reserve mechs already amounted to tens of millions of credits.
Naturally, this credit sum would easily spike in the hundreds of millions of credits after every operation when a mech company sustained several casualties. These periods of intense demands and vigorous repairs led to a large amount of resource transfers.
It would be easily to slip in a discrepancy in the midst of all of this activity.
Frankly, if Ves hadn’t started up his own business from the ground up and fabricated many copies of his own designs, he wouldn’t have developed an eye for this sort of stuff. The covert manipulation of resource usage effectively amounted to embezzlement.
His face grew dire at this realization. Who was responsible? Who would enrich themselves or increase their leverage at the cost of the entire mech regiment?
"The mech officers probably aren’t in it." He quickly determined. "They don’t have the technical acumen to pull off this kind of heist."
Besides, their whiny reports emphasized other faults.
That left Ves with three categories of culprits that he could think of. "It’s either the mech technicians, the mech designers, the logistics officers, or a combination."
He ruled out the latter two. A conspiracy between multiple parties involved too many people. News would get out sooner or later in that case. As for the people responsible for logistics, having worked alongside them for a time, Ves knew that they held themselves to a rigid standard of precision.
One of the things he learned from Professor Velten’s reports was that logistics had often been in a state of shambles with the Vandals. The lack of talent sent in their way and the dubious integrity of anyone exiled to their mech regiment meant that their records were filled with lies. Their account books contained more imagination than fantasy books and various discrepancies brazen exceeded fifty percent.
Colonel Lowenfield’s arrival to the Vandals upended their awful tradition of sloppy record-keeping. She overhauled the logistics department of the Vandals from the ground up. She kicked out or demoted the worst offenders while forcing the remainder into gruelling re-training sessions.
The Vandals kicked and screamed when they had to go through this painful reorganization process, but it was an act akin to cutting out the sickened flesh from a diseased body. Over time, the Flagrant Vandals enjoyed the benefits of cleaning up their act.
As one of her most important pet projects, the transformation of logistics should have been a continued priority of Colonel Lowenfield. Under her persistent gaze, nobody would even think of skimming from the top.
"So it’s either the mech technicians or the mech designers who are taking advantage of this somehow."
The main question rolling in his mind was how someone benefited from the embezzlement. It wasn’t as if anyone could expect to hide a few hundred tons of alloys underneath their bunks.
"The materials being embezzled will need to be used immediately. They can’t be stored for long, or else the pervasive monitoring system in every ship will pick up the goods."
Ves tried to imagine how it could work. He envisioned a situation where some low level mech technician inputted a resource usage of 5000 kilograms of lightweight alloys, but his actual usage only amounted to 4975 kilograms. That left this mech technician with a small but fairly substantial surplus of 25 kilograms, which would be worth tens of thousands of credits if sold in the open market.
"How can that low level mech technician transform 25 kilograms into actual credits?"
Ves saw no way this could be done, not without the Vandals detecting something fishy.
"Maybe it’s not about earning credits."
Perhaps the illicit trade took the form of an internal black market among the Vandals. Perhaps the mech technicians became tired of working under scarcity, and developed this method as a way to get their hands on critical materials that the high and mighty wizards that worked at logistics refused to dispense in their hands.
This sounded a lot more innocious than trying to sell the embezzlement materials in exchange for money. While it was still an unacceptable practice, it fell into the maxim that the Vandals needed to get things done no matter the rules.
In such a case, Ves didn’t feel inclined to stamp it out as long as the embezzlement remained within the range of the margin of error. He knew that being uptight in a mech regiment with a fairly weak tradition for exactness spelled a lot of trouble.
In the end, Ves wrote up a report of his observations and backed them up with proof from the data available to him. After some thought, he marked his report as sensitive. Only Major Verle and his staff would be allowed to read its contents.
"Iris."
"Yes, boss?" The woman looked up from her desk.
"Please bring this secure data chip to Major Verle or Lieutenant Commander Soapstone."
Iris stood up from her chair and walked over to receive the data chip. "Who do you want me to approach first?"
"Try bringing it to the attention of the major if you can. If not, you can try your luck with Soapstone. Whatever you do, don’t let anyone else receive the data chip. Its contents are fairly sensitive."
Iris threw a questioning gaze at Ves, but he refrained from throwing her a hint. Perhaps he was making a mountain out of a molehill, but he really didn’t wish to leak out his suspicions. If the more serious kind of embezzlement happened under the table, then he risked making powerful enemies among the Vandals.
Now that he wore the hat of head designer, he needed to rely on trust, persuasion and mutual interest in order to enact his changes. Burning his bridges with the offending party within the first days of his job was a one-way ticket to irrelevance.
Ves watched her leave their combined office and hoped that the major wouldn’t refuse the data chip.
Early on, he memorized the names of the staff under Major Verle. He found out that Lieutenant Commander held the reins with regards to resource procurement and allocation. As the powerful staff officer in charge of logistics, she could directly empower or cripple a mech company in the task force according to her whims.
Of course, Soapstone wouldn’t get away with overt favoritism. In fact, from the rumors he heard, Soapstone was one of Lowenfield’s protégés.
One of the more peculiar aspects of logistics officers was that they would sometimes be fulfilled by someone holding a naval rank rather than a mech rank. The Mech Corps operated on a weird organizational structure where the mech officers held army-like ranks while the ship officers adopted naval ranks.
This might lead to confusion sometimes, but overall the primacy of mech officers was well-established. Back in the Age of Conquest, an admiral was more powerful than the president of a state. The power to determine the life and death of entire planets was a powerful drug.
Now that humanity reached the Age of Mechs, nobody would bat an eyelid if a mech captain issued orders to a fleet commander.
Ship officers worked in the background these days, so nobody found it strange that they would be subordinated in such a fashion.
When Ves entrusted the data chip to Iris, he wasn’t afraid she would succeed in cracking it and peek at its contents. While the Flagrant Vandals endured lot of neglect from headquarters, they still enjoyed access to their central database, thereby allowing them to employ the latest technologies available to the Mech Corps.
The military-grade data chip that Ves handed over to Iris came packed with a dizzying array of security features, all without adding to its bulk. The moment someone tried to tamper with it, the entire data chip would go up in flames and melt into a useless puddle of alloys and composites. Nobody could retrieve any data from the melted chip unless they possessed the power to turn back time.
Besides, with the ever-present monitoring going on, Iris would never have the opportunity to fudge the data chip, even if she visited the toilet.
Half an hour later, Iris returned. "Major Verle probably likes you a lot, because once I told him that the data chip, he immediately accepted it. He pushed aside his other work and started digging into it immediately."
"Did he tell you anything or pass on a message to me?"
"Not as far as I’m aware of, boss." She replied. "A few seconds in, he shrugged and dropped his smile. I think he deliberately adopted a poker face in front of me. He also activated a privacy screen around his desk after shooing me away."
That didn’t tell Ves very much. In the back of his mind, there was always a chance that Major Verle might have a hand in the embezzlement. If this sort of dealings happened with the blessings of the major himself, then Ves might have landed himself in a very deep swamp.
He still had his principles though. Ves made his choice. Now the ball was in the major’s court.
It didn’t take long before Ves received a summons from Major Verle. He calmly closed his terminal and closed his eyes.
"Seems like this is a serious issue after all."
The level of embezzlement that happened on an individual level wasn’t too great, but when it had reached such a scale that practically every workshop was involved, the losses added up.
If all of the profits from these activities channeled in a small number of masterminds, then what Ves reported just threatened their livelihood.
The one thing he was afraid of most was that this level of corruption had reached the highest level. If Major Verle or Lieutenant Commander Soapstone received a cut of the profits, then Ves enormously harmed his relations with two of the most powerful officers in the Verle Task Force.
"Still, I can’t sit still and do nothing."
Though Ves readily admitted to himself that he wasn’t above pulling dirty tricks, he hated it when others tried to pull the wool over his eyes. Now that he accepted the job of head designer, everything concerning mechs came under his purview. Ves was not the type of person who tolerated employee theft.
"Urgh. I’m thinking of the Vandals like a business again." He shook his head.
He couldn’t help but make the parallels between his job as a head designer and his status as a business owner of the LMC.
It would be a mistake to adopt this mindset, because the web of power was much more complex here. Back at the LMC, he was not only the founder and sole designer, Ves also relied on his majority ownership to exert total control.
While his reliance on agents and employees effectively limited his power, it remained a fact that Ves held ultimate authority over his firm.
In the Vandal command structure, the mech officers formed the main combatants as well as the main decision makers. The ship and staff officers on the other hand mainly executed the decisions made by the mech officers.
Mech designers like Ves existed outside of this command structure, and acted more like external consultants. Even Professor Velten who shared the most intimate relationship with the Vandals held no military rank.
Because Ves fell outside the conventional command structure, he also benefited from a different perspective. That was why he went through with informing Major Verle of his findings. Even if he pissed some powerful Vandals off, they couldn’t do anything to him, at least outwardly. The most they could do was try to marginalize his influence.
If that happened, so be it, but Ves cooked up several plans that would counteract their petty attempts. Ves may not be a Journeyman Mech Designer, but his skills overshadowed everyone else’s in the fleet.
If it came down to it, Ves wasn’t above pulling up his sleeves to impress the savages of what a good mech designer could bring to the table.
As Ves stood up and exited his office, Iris called out to him just as the hatch slid open.
"Boss! Are you going out?"
"Yeah, it seems like what I dug up requires an immediate response. Stay here and keep collating the data."
"Will do."
After Ves made his initial discoveries, he didn’t feel like digging into the data anymore. He pushed some of the duties onto Iris, who unfortunately couldn’t match his Intelligence.
Ves keenly witnessed the difference between his own capabilities and someone with more human-like Intelligence values. Despite benefiting from a minor boost in mental capacity due to her Jupiter Family heritage, she required weeks to do what Ves could complete in a day.
This must be another reason why Professor Velten thought he would be suitable to take on the role of head designer. He processed data faster than others, which helped enormously in a data-oriented job like his. Head designers needed to make difficult decisions according to the information at hand, and Ves could take in much more information at much higher speeds, so he possessed a definite advantage in this area.
Any other mech designer thrust into this seat would quickly be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of data required to make the right decisions. They could either spend months getting familiar with their position or take some shortcuts and enact policies based on an incomplete understanding of the situation.
"Such outcomes will inevitably lead to disaster."
When Ves stepped into Major Verle’s stateroom, he glanced around as his steps brought him to one of the available seats.
The major didn’t have time to furnish his stateroom according to his tastes. He must have lost everything he owned when the Stubby Growler went down. The metallic walls looked grey and bare while the furniture all consisted of the most basic copies that any mech technician could fabricate according to a standard template.
This was a good sign to Ves, because the bare furnishings signalled that Verle didn’t care for material possessions.
"You’ve given me quite a conundrum, Mr. Larkinson." Verle started as he shut off his terminal, leaving his desk bare. He stared at Ves with inscrutable eyes. "Do you have anything to say for yourself?"
Ves couldn’t read any hint of Verle’s intentions. Was he pleased that Ves brought the matter to his attention, or had he encroached upon a taboo?
He made a conscious choice to force the issue at the start. He disliked uncertainty, and he would rather not have this cloud hanging over his head. Now was the time to see why Colonel Lowenfield trusted the major so much.
"Sir, as the newly appointed head designer of this fleet, it’s my responsibility to see that our mechs are as capable as possible to handle the threats in our way. The possible embezzlement happening under the table is a small but wide-reaching influence on our strength."
"How can it be both small but wide-reaching?"
"Like a butterfly flapping its wings on one side of the planet, the effects can lead to a typhoon on the other side of the globe. The siphoning of resources away from their intended purposes effectively leaves our mech companies with 0.5 percent less resources. This might not sound like much, but at a scale of five-hundred spaceborn mechs, this loss amounts to missing two or three complete mechs."
"And this is relevant because...?"
"Think about it. If we get ambushed at our next stop by five-hundred enemy mechs, and we deploy 497 mechs in response, that gap could mean the difference between victory and defeat."
Ves didn’t need to explain it any further. In closely-matched battles, the ultimate victor would often be decided by the side who could tip the balance in their favor. If both sides enjoyed an even playing field in terms of mech quality and mech composition, a minor advantage in numbers would eventually lead to a decisive advantage in numbers.
Even if both sides didn’t commit, a handful of extra mechs could drastically influence the amount of casualties both sides sustained.
"Is our spaceborn contingent in that bad of a state?" Verle asked.
"Their state is fairly good, since they mainly scored a lopsided victory in the Detemen System. By now, most mechs that have sustained damage are in a decent shape, though it will take the more heavily damaged mechs a little more time to become space worthy again. I’m not worried about the present. I’m concerned about the future. If this wasteful pattern continues, we’ll continue to suffer preventable losses."
"Are you sure of that?"
"I’m very sure of it, sir. You’re the expert in mech tactics, so I’m sure you have a better idea at how this could lead to unnecessary losses."
The major fell silent and tapped his desk with his finger. "Have you narrowed down who’s responsible for these actions?"
"No." Ves shook his head. "It will take a more thorough investigation to get at the root of the problem. I can point out the mech technicians who are incorrectly logging their resource usages, but I have the feeling that they aren’t the main beneficiaries of this scheme. Whoever is responsible for selling of trading the siphoned materials should be the true masterminds."
"I see. If you had the power to respond to this issue, what would you do?"
That might have been a loaded question, but Ves felt obligated to answer it. After a lot of thought about his new role, he gained some enlightenment about the purpose of mech designers attached to mech regiments.
Mech officers were the people in charge. That never changed. Everyone else assisted them in the background. As a mech designer and a head designer to boot, Ves was tasked with the responsibility to advise Major Verle so that he could make the most important decisions after taking everything into account.
With this role in mind, Ves provided several answers. "It depends on what kind of goal I want to achieve. If I wish to send a clear message that activities like this that harm our common interests will not be tolerated, I would investigate it thoroughly and punish the offenders according to the strictest regulations."
"The penalties for embezzlement can be quite severe."
"They played with fire, they should expect to get burned. We are not talking about innocent people here. Even if it isn’t as bad as they look like, unauthorized shuffling of materials is still a moderate offense that needs to be cracked down."
"So do you believe that this is the option that we should be pursuing?"
"Ah, there are other options available as well, sir. If we crack down too hard, we might upset a lot of people, which would lead to a lot of resentment and division. We can’t afford internal division while the task force is still at risk of getting caught by the Vesians on their own turf. If the problem needs to be taken care of with some finesse, we can also opt for a softer touch."
"A slap on the wrist." Verle deducted. "That will send a weak message to the offenders. It will reinforce the belief that the embezzlers are impervious and that we don’t have the guts to incur their wrath."
"Still, dealing with people with overblown senses of importance is better if you still have them on your side. That’s why I suggested this option."
They both paused a bit as they contemplated the two options with two very different outcomes. While Ves came up with these possible responses by himself, he couldn’t say which one would be better.
Cracking down on the practice would hurt the cohesion of the Flagrant Vandals in the short term. The damage could be quite severe if a lot of powerful people had their fingers in the pot. Yet by bringing the hurt forward, the Vandals would be able to clean up their act in one go, which was better for everyone in the long term.
As for the other options, it led to the least amount of hurt in the short term, but did not effectively solve the problem at all. Perhaps it would depress any illicit activities for a few weeks, but the masterminds would not be deterred to pick up their shady dealings again. They might have even learned their lessons this time and spend more effort on hiding their trails.
In either case, further investigation was necessary to figure out the extent of the profiteering.
After a lengthy pause, Verle came to a decision on what to do. "Both of your options have their strong points, but there are more ways to address this problem than these two extremes. You still lack experience in this area."
Ves sat up straighter. He was curious what Verle really thought about the matter. It sounded like he wasn’t involved after all.
"I agree with you that this problem needs to be nipped in the bud. Now that it’s been brought to my attention, I won’t rest easy until this activity ceases. Yet tact is important. Our ultimate goal is to make it to the Reinald Republic alive, so I cannot afford to put some of my most subordinates in the brig."
Major Verle finally explained his solution to Ves. "Rules are rules, but the mission is more important. Exacting justice on the offenders might soothe your conscious, but it will only weaken our strength."
"That sounds as if you favor a slap on the wrist." Ves carefully said, though he couldn’t stop from frowning. "From my impression of the Vandal mech technicians, there is a large proportion of bad apples among them. They won’t stop trying to take advantage of the system."
The Mech Corps never sent any promising people to the Flagrant Vandals. Everyone had their issues, and the mech technicians wasn’t exempt from this problem. While the chief technicians mostly helped rein in their small-minded thoughts, chiefs could only keep their eyes on so many things.
"As I stated, the most important priority is to maintain our strength. The best way to do so is to stop the embezzlement without affronting the so-called masterminds as you call it. This can be done by adopting both solutions, but at different timings."
Ves tried to wrap his head around the idea. He started to get his eyes on a glimpse of such a plan. "Warn them first, and crack down hard if they persist?"
"In essence, that is correct. Call it starting from a clean slate if you will." Major Verle nodded. "First, in order to minimize the unrest, it’s best if we do not give out the impression that we have locked onto their scent. Instead, you can come up with a scheme where you’ll claim to introduce a new resource tracking system to replace the old one. The men won’t question this change because it’s typical for a new boss to implement bold ideas."
"It’s going to take a lot of work to replace the software, sir." Ves carefully pointed out. "It’s not something that can be done in a day."
"That’s even better! The ideal transition time should be a week. That’s enough time for everyone to clean up their acts and sweep their misdeeds under the rug. Once the new system is in place, everyone should have made up their minds. Those who are smart or careful may have gotten the message. It’s not a coincidence that the resource management system has received an overhaul."
"What about those who haven’t gotten the message, sir? Maybe the embezzlers are shrewd, but there are a fair amount of low-level people involved who aren’t as perceptive. There’s also the greedy ones who don’t wish to relinquish their power."
Major Verle leaned back on his chair and waved his hand. "Idiots like these who scorn the opportunities I’ve given to them to start with a clean slate don’t deserve any consideration. We’ll investigate them and throw the book at them for any offenses they’ve committed after the new system is in place. I’d rather have them out of way no matter how important their positions are because I can’t trust these scum to have my back in a fight."
In other words, the idiots that continued to hold small thoughts did more damage than what they contributed back to the Vandals. Major Verle wouldn’t be merciful to these cancerous growths.
The contempt sounded obvious in the major’s voice. Ves looked impressed at the commanding officer of the task force for coming up with such an elegant solution. It contained both mercy and resolve, and throughout it all it ensured the Vandals maintained their best strength.
"I understand now." Ves nodded, his eyes shining bright. "Still, some important people might get caught at the end. Their absence might affect the task force’s condition more than the absence of a few mechs."
That was the sticking point with any solution that advocated for crackdowns. Even though Major Verle’s suggestion provided a lot more leeway, it still needed to be backed up examples. If someone like a chief technician got caught, then the maintenance department of an entire combat carrier might fall into chaos.
"There is a limit to our patience. We need to send the right message and draw a line in the sand. It’s fine if people are playing tricks, but once they are caught, they better look honest. This was Colonel Lowenfield’s stance when she first reformed the Flagrant Vandals."
"I understand. Thank you for telling me this, sir."
"It is good that you’ve brought this up to me shortly after you have discovered this. An issue of this nature isn’t something that you should decide on your own."
Ves and Major Verle hammered out the details in the next half hour. Ves needed to borrow some people and receive the right authority to push through this overhaul, which Major Verle directly granted in his name. With Verle backing this decision, it wouldn’t take more than week to update the resource management system, though it would take some time to iron out the wrinkles.
After Ves left his stateroom, he came out of it with a much better impression of his superior. The man patiently explained his thoughts during the discussion and decision-making process. This allowed Ves to understand his priorities.
The overarching message was that their survival and the completion of the mission ranked as the highest priorities. Major Verle wouldn’t have bothered with this relatively small case of embezzlement if hadn’t affected the overall strength of his forces. He also didn’t appear to feel compelled to act on it in times of peace.
Sadly, times had changed, and the Bright Republic had been plunged into war. The Flagrant Vandals successfully completed an operation that slapped the Vesians in the face, and now they were on the run.
Under these conditions, it was no surprise that Major Verle pursued every possible solution that could raise their fighting strength.
With a new set of orders in store, Ves returned to his office and prepared a proposal. The most challenging aspect about the change was that Ves needed to find the right software to replace the old one. The central database that Ves now had access to offered more than a dozen software packages. It gave Ves quite a headache to dig through the jargon.
Still, Ves only spent a few hours before he picked a replacement package. Now he needed to implement it throughout the entire task force.
"Iris."
"Yes, boss?"
"Please schedule an immediate meeting on this ship to every mech designer in the fleet. Set the time at half an hour after we drop out of FTL."
Iris looked startled. "Uh, do you want to invite every mech designer, or only the high-ranking ones?"
Ves thought about it. The high-ranking mech designers consisted of those who previously worked in the design team, while the lower-ranking ones were like Carlos who worked alongside the mech technicians.
Considering that the change affected the latter more than the former, Ves decided to invite everyone. "Bring them all. It will be good for them to meet their new superior in person at least once."
It wasn’t as if Ves had the time to hop into a shuttle and pay a visit to the forty-odd ships that made up the task force. The inability for shuttles to travel from one ship to another during FTL formed the main limiting factor.
Even if an entire fleet transitioned into FTL in the same direction under identical circumstances, a ship often fell into their own band of dimension as it were. In general, a ship in FTL would never be able to interact with any other ships in FTL.
Of course, it wasn’t unheard of for something like that to happen anyway. Rumor had it that the CFA, MTA and the first-rate superstates mastered technologies that made FTL warfare possible.
Those same rumors stated that trying to wage a battle in FTL was a massive pain in the butt, so almost no one bothered with it unless a ship carried a vital objective.
"Do you wish to tell the mech designers the items on the agenda, sir?"
"No need to bother, Iris, although tell them that the meeting might drag on for half a day, so make sure their schedules are cleared. I won’t tolerate any absences."
"Understood, though I’d caution you that it’s not good for the fleet if they are absent from their posts for too long. They play an important role aboard those ships as mech experts. Without their hands-on guidance, the mech technicians won’t know what to do."
"They’ll make do without one for a day. It’s very important for me to meet all the mech designers in person."
Ves planned to take the opportunity for this meeting to accomplish multiple objectives at once. Besides announcing the software system change, he also wanted to appraise his subordinates in person and see whether they measured up. He planned to select two or three as his deputies.
He hadn’t forgotten about the importance of delegation. Ves could not possibility keep his eye on everything that needed to be done. The software change alone might stall to a month if Ves lacked capable underlings to check all the work being done at his direction.
Picking a handful of mech designers elevating them to a position of power over their colleagues should help with widening his reach. While Ves had no delusions that the people he promoted would turn into his loyal subjects, Ves would always be able to strip them of their authority if they abused his trust.
"Do you want to invite Venerable O’Callahan’s design team as well?"
Ves froze for a moment, before coming up with a response. "No. They require a special touch. I’ll address them separately at a later date."
The expert pilot’s design time nominally came under his purview, but Ves felt much less confident about being able to command their respect. These mech designers worked hard and tried to do their best to enter the venerable’s design team.
"They’ve probably turned into total fanboys for O’Callahan by this time."
The hero worship surrounding expert pilots often reached a dreadful state. Some even enjoyed the adoration of trillions of people across the galaxy as some of their exploits would be broadcasted throughout the galactic net.
Even a washed-up senile expert pilot like O’Callahan enjoyed a lot of renown with the Vandals. Whenever Ves ate his meals at the mess hall, he occasionally overheard the spacers treating the expert mech pilot’s presence in their task force as a point of pride.
Only a few Vandals knew about the true character of O’Callahan. The first time Ves heard his voice, the expert pilot refused to sortie on command! He directly disobeyed an order from Major Verle. Even worse, the venerable got away with it without a scratch!
"Maybe that’s why the major is rather sensitive about this issue."
Due to O’Callahan’s unique position, Major Verle could never sanction the proud symbol of their mech regiment. If word got out that the Vandals quarreled with the venerable, morale would instantly drop to the bottom, because the men might start to believe that O’Callahan wouldn’t defend the Vandals with all of his heart.
Once Iris sent out the invitations, Ves began to make his preparations. He studied the software package and began to draft up a plan that would implement them on any machine related to resource usage.
He also made some other preparations to accomplish his other goals at the same time, and also diverted some time in studying the profiles of the other mech designers. These would be the only people he possessed the authority to command.
"They won’t be happy for a relative newcomer like me to obtain the position of head designer."
The Mech Corps managed its mech designers in two different ways. The internal mech designers consisted of careerists who voluntarily signed up to serve for at least ten years. They contributed a lot of work to their mech regiments and accumulated a lot of seniority.
Ves fell into the category of external mech designers. He wouldn’t have been here if the Mech Corps hadn’t drafted him due to the outbreak of the current war. The difference between him and the internal mech designers was that Ves held no seniority at all.
Having mixed with the Flagrant Vandals for a long time, Iris explained it succinctly. "Some of these internal mech designers are very ambitious. They’ve been working diligently for a promotion. Those who do well even get the privilege of receiving Professor Velten’s personal tutelage. Think about how they must feel how their hard-earned merits are ignored when the position of head designers have passed over their heads."
This was a serious contradiction that Ves needed to deal with as early as possible.
The Verle Task Force transitioned out of FTL at the outer edge of a boring red dwarf system. Due to minute variances in the FTL drives, tiny discrepancies got magnified into substantial divergences. Major Verle’s ships spread out in a messy shotgun pattern that opened them up to a devastating ambush.
Fortunately, none of the ships detected any ships or mechs or weapon emplacements in the immediate vicinity.
Nobody let down their guard. The combat carriers adopted an immediate defensive posture and the entire fleet contracted in a defensive formation.
It took fifteen minutes of intensive scanning before everyone eased up the tension in their bodies. Besides a light rebel presence, the uninhabited star system contained no overt threats.
The fleet cautiously approached an asteroid field. It would take some hours to arrive and many more hours to mine some low-quality ores. While the asteroids didn’t contain anything valuable, there were many uses for common materials, such as replenishing their ammunition which they used up at a massive scale during the Detemen Operation.
"The mech designers are on their way, boss." Iris reported to Ves. "Their shuttles will dock at the Shield of Hispania no later than twenty minutes. Inter-ship traffic is currently hectic so expect some delays."
"That’s okay. Has anyone declined the invitation to meet?"
"Surprisingly not. Every high and low-ranking mech designer answered your summons."
With no problems there, Ves waited for the moment to arrive while Iris went off to prepare the conference room. He thought about his job and found fulfilling it to be a demanding job. Trying to solve every problem within his scope was frankly impossible, but somehow he had taken a liking of trying to achieve the impossible.
It was different from growing a business. Back when he built up the LMC until it could stand on its own two feet, he enjoyed a lot of freedom and held the ultimate authority over how it should be run.
Yet now he answered to Major Verle. Not only that, he needed to maintain relationships with everyone involved in order to get things done. It demanded a different approach where he became dependent on others to reciprocate.
Ves cherished this opportunity because it allowed him to build up valuable experience in leading design teams later on. As long as he got the knack of managing the mech designers assigned to the Flagrant Vandals, he would easily be able to manage design teams working for the LMC.
Half an hour later, the conference room became packed with mech designers arranged in classroom-style seating. When Ves entered the room, he observed an obvious division between two types of mech designers.
Those at the front looked familiar to Ves. He recognized many of them from the Inheritor, Akkara and Hellcat design teams. Excluding Ves, there was only nine of them present in the Verle Task Force. All of them had been cut off from the Wolf Mother which accompanied the primary Vandal fleet.
A larger number of mech designers sat at the rear. Iris must have arranged an obvious gap in the seating between the two groups to emphasize the differences between the two. Despite numbering around thirty people, none of them had a say due to their inferior standing and skills.
When Ves stared at the low-ranking mech designers. He memorized their names beforehand out of due diligence, but he didn’t expect to call on any of them unless they screwed up their jobs. His weighty stare intimidated the low-ranking mech designers. All of them chose to lower their heads in a sign of submission.
Only a handful of mech designers tried to keep up a confident facade. Ves deliberately carried himself in a compelling manner and concentrated his mind in an attempt to conjure up an aura of blood and war.
The results were inconclusive. Some of the weaker-willed mech designers appeared to be affected, but any mech designer that worked alongside the Vandals got used to working with professional killers and raiders. Compared to a genuine mech officer such as Captain Orfan or Captain Branser, his own aura fell short.
"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard the flagship." Ves began as he approached the front of the conference room. "I’m sure you already know this, but my name is Ves Larkinson, and I’m the temporary head designer of the Verle Task Force. I’ve called you here to explain my vision to you so that we are all on the same track. I’ll also be introducing some new policies and directives so that we can be of more help to the fleet that has landed itself in a precarious situation."
Someone raised his hand.
"Mr. Mercator, you wish to say something?"
Ves encountered Bovis Mercator a couple of times when they worked aboard the Wolf Mother. He never saw too much of Mercator because the man had been assigned to the Akkara design team.
Mercator happened to be one of the older Apprentice Mech Designers among them. His outward appearance suggested that he reached his early forties.
"Mr. Larkinson, forgive my rudeness, but the leadership issue isn’t settled yet. You’re too new to the Vandals, and you’ve only been appointed to become the task force’s head designer because you happen to be the closest mech designer to Major Verle. Now that we aren’t fleeing at full tilt from the Vesian reinforcement fleets, we should revisit some of the decisions made in haste."
"Oh really?" Ves narrowed his eyes at Mercator.
The careerist mech designer didn’t hide his ambition. In fact, he stood with a confident demeanor, as if his words made a lot of sense.
Over half of the high-ranking mech designers happened to nod in agreement. Most of them belonged to the same clique of careerists as Mercator. If it came to a vote, Ves had no doubt that he would lose. He was never one for popularity contests, and his background was too shallow among the mech designers working for the Vandals.
Ves minutely shook his head. He would never let this discussion come to a vote.
"Mr. Mercator, I think you misunderstand something. My appointment to head designer is arranged by Professor Velten. Major Verle might have a say in the matter, but it’s the professor who put her stamp of approval in my field promotion. If you believe the professor has made an error, you are free to bring your complaints to her doorstep."
The older mech designer’s face quickly turned red. Obviously, nobody had the guts to question one of the professor’s decision. Even if her mind was wracked with senility, her dignity was inviolable to mech designers in the same way that mech pilots would never dare to offend Venerable O’Callahan.
Surprisingly enough, Mercator remained standing. "Even if that is true, it still doesn’t change the fact that your abrupt elevation is a highly unusual irregular. As a young, conscripted mech designer, you are too new to the Flagrant Vandals. There are many, more experienced mech designers in this room that are a tad more suitable to the position."
The lower-ranking mech designers smelled a power play. Most of them kept themselves as still as possible to avoid getting caught up with a particular side. There was no advantage for them to commit to a single high-ranking mech designer when they would likely need to work under several of them in the foreseeable future.
Only a handful expressed support to Mercator’s suggestion. There was no question these designers were in his camp.
Ves crossed his arms and smirked. "I suppose you’re volunteering for the job, then?"
Maybe his confidence unnerved Mercator. Things weren’t entirely going according to his script. The careerist visibly hesitated for a moment before he firmed up his resolve.
"I am." He stated and turned around to address the other mech designers in the room. "Most of you have seen me around. I’ve been working with the Vandals for over four years, and while that may not sound so much, I have worked in several other mech division of the Mech Corps over a span of fifteen years. My extensive experience in working in many different design teams makes me the best choice to lead you all. Think for yourself who you want to rely on more, a conscripted young designer whose heart isn’t in it, or a mech designer who is fully committed to the Vandals?"
A low thrum of conversation broke out as several mech designers nodded or started to discuss the matter. Ves didn’t enforce a silence because it hardly affected his own plan. It might even be better to keep them talking.
His evident decision to keep his mouth shut gave the mech designers the sense that Ves had no power to avoid this leadership struggle. Some even believed his silence at this moment was a tacit admission that Mercator had a point.
As expected, someone else couldn’t let the older man hog all of the momentum. A woman in her thirties stood up. "Bovis, there are several mech designers among us that can lead us, but you aren’t qualified. Just look at you! You’re almost fifty and you’re nowhere near advancing to a Journeyman Mech Designer! A talentless hack like you will command our respect!"
"Emlanin! Just because your uncle is a mech captain of the Vandals doesn’t mean you’re suitable! The only reason why you’re so prominent lately is because your uncle constantly puts a good word for you in everyone’s ears!"
Ves looked at the woman who stood up. He remembered her. Emlanin Trozin, a fellow colleague in the Hellcat design team. For her age, she possessed a decent amount of talent, and it was obvious that she used that advantage to attack Mercator’s prestige.
"The job of head designer should fall on someone who can grow into the job!" Trozin claimed.
"Nonsense! Head designers must be capable right at the start! Someone like you needs years to get used to the job! The mission can’t wait that long!"
Ves coughed and raised his palm. "Quiet down."
Raising his palm was a signal to Iris to dampen the conversation. She sat unobtrusively in the corner of the conference room. The moment she spotted the raised palm, she quietly activated a setting on her comm.
The conference room immediately fell into silence as everyone that opened their mouths only let out empty air. Hidden dampeners built along the walls neutralized all the sounds that escaped from their throats.
"Good. If I can have your attention please. It’s obvious that the leadership issue needs to be settled today. I won’t be a tyrant and insist on sticking to my job. In the interest of fairness, I believe that anyone who wants to throw their hats into the ring should compete against each other. Now, who wants to be the head designer?"
Four high-ranking mech designers raised their heads, including Mercator and Trozin.
Ves nodded. "Alright, that’s five if you count me in. Now, we can settle the leadership issue in multiple ways. Rather than flap our mouths with endless boasts and empty promises, I think it’s better to resort to a more objective means of comparison."
This was where he sprung his trap. His grin grew wider.
"Let’s hold a five-way design duel."
Iris released the sound dampening at that moment, causing the ’contestants’ to erupt in protest.
"That’s not fair, Mr. Larkinson!" Mercator yelled in a shrill voice. "We are not brutes like mech pilots who like to settle every difference with a duel! We are mech designers! More than that, we work for the Mech Corps, not for ourselves! This isn’t the private sector that you are used to. We work in cooperation, not in competition with each other!"
Trozin put in her own objection. "I don’t often agree with Bovis, but he’s right. Design duels simply aren’t done in our circle. As mech designers of the Mech Corps, we are always put to work on smaller aspects of specific projects. We have never been given the opportunity design a mech or variant on our own. It’s highly unfair for you to propose we duel someone like you who possess ample solo design experience."
Both of them put up valid objections, but Ves chuckled in amusement. "You want to take over my job? Then show me that you’re qualified! I don’t care about seniority, connections or other nebulous factors, and neither do our enemies! I will never surrender my post to someone weak! Show me your strength. Prove to our audience here if you are skilled enough to take on this responsibility."
His argument immediately turned the mood against their favor. The four aspirants all looked ill in some manner.
Though a few of them tried to squeeze out an excuse or two why design duels shouldn’t be the deciding factor, none of them sounded convincing. The more they whined, the more they damaged their standing.
Ves smirked as the aspirants who wanted to take over his position tried to weasel their way out of a design duel.
He had to admit that he worried about the issue before he came up with the idea of a duel. He anticipated some of the reasons that others might bring up, and he couldn’t completely retort them all.
The main sticking point lay in the seniority argument. Though the oldest and most experienced mech designer wasn’t necessarily the most qualified one for the job, they offered a lot more assurances to everyone compared to an external mech designer that had been drafted into the Mech Corps.
Ves spent hours wracking his head on this issue when he first got the news. He came up with various arguments, lies, schemes and tricks before he metaphorically smacked himself on the head.
"Why am I trying to accommodate a bunch of weaklings? As far as I’m aware of, I’m the best mech designer within a range of several light-years. In terms of knowledge, design experience and skill, nobody can hold a candle to me. They want to pick a fight with me? I’ll show everyone what fools they are for challenging me!"
He really needed that kick in the butt. Ever since then, he dropped most of his schemes and simply aimed to steer the gathering into a design duel.
Ves ignored the half-hearted arguments between the most ambitious mech designers and threw his gaze at the high-ranking mech designers that kept themselves out of contention and the low-ranking mech designers who formed the silent majority.
Both these groups appeared to be unconvinced by the counter arguments put forth. A mech duel might inherently benefit Ves, but that did not mean it was a bad choice. It was the most direct and uncomplicated option available, and relied directly on the personal capabilities of the mech designer to get ahead.
As for votes or other means of deciding the winner? All of them looked weak in comparison. How could anyone think to take over the position of head designer by currying favor among the mech designers?
No matter how good the likes of Mercator and Trozin built up their reputation among the mech designers, their refusal to accept a duel marked them as a coward.
Ves maintained his ever-present smirk as he sat back and let his rivals come to terms with the inevitable. Once he threw out the suggestion of a duel, nobody would be able to retract from the challenge without affecting their reputation.
Personally, he never liked duels. It was a barbaric practice that had initially been revived by mech pilots wanting to prove their mettle.
Mech designers picked up the tradition and tweaked its format to allow for an even playing field for competing designs.
Design duels formed a controversial means of settling an argument, because it could never be completely fair. Nonetheless, it wasn’t outwardly unfair either, and the outcome would always be clear and unambiguous.
Once the mech designers in the crowd started to nod off, Ves decided that he let the aspirants prattle around long enough. He clapped his hands, forcing everyone into silence.
"If my esteemed colleagues are finished, let’s proceed to the design duel. I’ve already prepared the venue."
He spoke of his rivals as if they were children, causing their faces to sour even further. Compared to their evident frustration, Ves looked like a beacon of calm. His confidence oozed out of his body. It was as if he never doubted he would lose at anything.
"Come along now, we don’t have all day."
In actual fact, Ves booked eight hours in one of the large-scale training rooms. When he booked the training room, a ship officer immediately got on the line and asked him why he needed so much time.
Training rooms were very valuable because they allowed for extensive simulations with high-quality projectors. The mech squads aboard the Shield of Hispania competed against each other for time in the training room, and here came Ves to snatch their favorite cookie from their grasp.
He answered the ship officer in the simplest terms. "I need this training room to put some unruly children in their place."
Once the Vandal officer heard that Ves intended to hold a design duel, the man smiled in understanding and wished him luck.
The duel was sacred and enjoyed a lot of respect in human society. That was why none of the mech designers retreated from the challenge. Backing out before a fight brought a lot more shame than suffering an outright loss. At least in the latter case, the losers proved their valor to go through with a fight.
Over the next eight hours, a slow-moving tragedy took place. The mech designers looked on from a distance as Ves and four ambitious mech designers took the time to design a mech out of a selection of random parts and mech sections.
From time to time, small groups of off-duty mech pilots and servicemen strolled into the training room. Word of the duel spread throughout the entire ship, and everyone who arrived expected to witness a riveting battle.
All they saw were five mech designers meticulously putting their designs together. To those who lacked a technical background, it was as exciting as watching paint dry. Though some of the ship engineers chose to remain, the disappointed mech pilots always left immediately after.
In the interest of maintaining a veneer of fairness, Ves set a completely random selection of parts at the spot. This way, Ves proved that he hadn’t prepared a complete design beforehand.
He wouldn’t be able to prepare beforehand because the selection process only picked out a couple of hundred components out of a basket of billions different options. Each new scramble drew out a completely different selection of parts.
All of the parts came from mech and component designs published over two-hundred years ago. Their simple and outdated nature allowed his competitors to work with them more proficiently as they didn’t need to spend too much time trying to figure out.
Of course, Ves enjoyed a more lopsided advantage as nobody could match his knowledge and raw Intellect.
He also let the duel take place over a fairly lengthy period of eight hours in order to give everyone plenty of time to go through their design process. While he could have cobbled up a design in two hours or less, his rivals would cry out if he went through with that. Most designers needed at least six hours to come up with a decent duelling mech.
The generous conditions failed to close the gap. Ves designed a simple but exquisite space knight. He thought about designing a hybrid mech instead, but rejected it because a space knight could handle ranged attackers by closing in with its flight system.
Ves limited the design duel to spaceborn mechs because most mech designers possessed more proficiency in this mech classification. That became evident when most mech designers presented mech designs that shamelessly ripped off the Inheritor and Hellcat designs.
"As expected." He smirked.
The design duel happened entirely in a virtual setting. They couldn’t afford the resources nor equipment to test their designs in the physical universe.
To avoid complications, Ves also stipulated that the duels proceeded with non-iterative piloting AIs. This meant that they would reset after each duel and negated any learning advantage when the next duels took place.
Though the AIs piloted the simulated mechs like overactive teenagers, the distinct strengths and weaknesses of each design sprung forth.
Each design dueled with every other design, so four duels took place in total.
His design easily beat the Hellcat ripoffs. While he had to admit that the two designers who chose to design a hybrid mech understood the mechanics of the design, it remained a fact that hybrid mechs was exceedingly complex and introduced many inefficiencies in their construction.
The designers completely disregarded the fact that hybrid mechs derived their value from their ability to affect morale. The Hellcat worked great in larger skirmishes and pitched battles, and only against human opponents.
Against an emotionless AI that lacked the capability to feel fear, the Hellcat ripoff strong burst performance crashed against the indomitable shield of the opposing space knight designed by Ves.
Frankly, Ves was disappointed in the performance of the Hellcat imitations. Mech designers like Trozin who aimed for a promotion should have known better than to resort to hybrid mechs for a duel.
If Trozin became their head designer, Ves predicted that she would eventually screw up in a catastrophic manner. Her blind spots could compete against black holes in how much space they distorted!
"They’re so stupid." He whispered softly to Iris as they stood at the side while he projections of the virtual duels proceeded apace. "The Hellcats are meant to rally allies and intimidate enemy mech pilots. Their greatest strengths are entirely negated by the duel format."
Iris shrugged. "They only know to design something familiar to them. They’ve been exposed to the same three designs for several years, with few opportunities to develop any other designs. The Akkara heavy cannoneer isn’t suitable for a duel in space, so that effectively leaves only two design templates."
The Inheritor ripoffs put up a better fight. The light skirmishers possessed the speed advantage. Against the medium space knight that Ves designed, his creation could never catch up if the skirmishers insisted on staying out of range.
Yet according to the standard mech dueling conventions, the faster mech needed to take the initiative to attack. An endless chase where the slower mech tried to catch up to the faster mech in vain was more of a farce than a proper duel.
The AIs piloting the dagger-wielding skirmishers wasted a fair amount of fuel before they got it in their heads that they should initiate the attack. They switched from evasion to offense and tried to charge his space knight which took up a basic but solid defensive stance.
None of the skirmishers ever got in more than surface scratches. Knights formed the bane against skirmishers no matter if the battle took place on land or in space. Their comprehensive armor coverage meant that skirmishers couldn’t sneak around the back and get an easy kill.
In fact, Ves anticipated that his space knight faced a light mech, so he deliberately lightened the frontal armor in order to free up the capacity to strengthen the rear armor. This wasn’t a good idea under normal circumstances, and even without this tweak his space knight would win, but the victory became a lot more lopsided as a consequence.
Mercator’s expression grew uglier and uglier as his pride and joy ineffectually danced around the space knight designed by an external mech designer. The pathetic performance of his Inheritor imitation reflected back on him. Some of his allies even started to back away from him, as if they were afraid that others would associate them in the same group.
"This isn’t fair!" He hissed. "A spaceborn skirmisher is naturally restrained by a space knight! My design never stood a chance from the start!"
"What is it with you and fairness?" Ves jabbed back. "I’ve iterated the format and all of the rules beforehand in a transparent manner. Nobody forced you to design a skirmisher."
"This doesn’t count! Trozin is just incompetent for designing such an awful hybrid knight." Mercator incisively stated. "You may have won one round, but I demand another duel with landbound mechs! The design I’ve worked on most is the Akkara heavy mech! Do you dare to pit yourself against my land-based creations?"
"Hahahaha!" Ves laughed. "There are no do-overs here, no second chances. As I just said, I’ve stated the duel format before and nobody brought up any objections. Mr. Mercator, I sincerely ask you to temper your ambitions. Right now, the Verle Task Force depends on their spaceborn mechs to escape from the Kingdom. A mech designer who can’t design a decent spaceborn mech is wholly unfit to become their head designer!"
This argument practically formed the death knell of Mercator’s ambitions. The majority of the mech designers knew what was at stake and which kind of mechs they needed to depend on to survive.
The day ended in an anti-climactic manner. It went without saying that Ves was the only one who won every duel. No rematch or runoff duel was necessary to prove the crowd who won.
"You went too far, Ves. You demolished them completely. You showed no mercy to Bovis."
"Mr. Mercator had it coming." Ves waved his hand dismissively as they returned to their shared office. "
"It’s one thing to put down a rabid dog. It’s another thing entirely to torture the poor creature all the while you laughed like a maniac! Did you see your face at the end? You reveled in your bullying, and don’t say it’s not! You crushed them by abusing your superiority!"
"And that’s supposed to be a bad thing, sir? It’s not my fault they’re so incompetent. For all of his ambition, Mr. Mercator doesn’t have the skill to back it up. I’m sure he can give me a run for my money if we competed on designing heavy cannoneers, but the Akkara mechs only take up a small part of the Vandal mech roster."
The design duels exposed the inadequacies of his challengers. This was the privilege afforded by strength. Though he did not measure up to a genuine Journeyman Mech Designer, out of all of the mech designers in the task force, he came closest to meeting this standard.
The entire spectacle revolving around the duel showcased his strength in a way that a boring resume never could. He could talk and boast about his accomplishments all he wanted, but humans but the lesson only hit home when Ves smacked his superiority in their faces.
Unfortunately, Iris brought him back to reality. "They’re not resigned to this loss. You can see it in their faces. They think you cheated somehow, or stacked the deck against their favor from the start. I can imagine that Bovis will quickly try to stir up trouble to destabilize your position."
"I know."
"You do, sir?"
"Yeah, that’s why I stomped them all so hard. These ambitious mech designers can try to build up support all they want, but their standing among the Vandals and the other mech designers has taken an enormous hit. The perception of their strength is their foundation. Now that I’ve undermined their basic qualifications, they’ll face an uphill battle trying to pull people in their camps."
Iris sighed and shook her head. "That’s not sufficient to silence dissent. People are impressed with you, but there’s a long road ahead of you if you want to make them loyal to you, boss."
"I’m not thinking that far ahead. The Verle Task Force will only take two months to reach the Reinald Republic. They’ll dither around for a few weeks perhaps before they return home. A round trip will actually take a shorter amount of time since we don’t have to worry about sneaking through enemy-occupied space. So in total, I expect this arrangement to last four months at most. Once we reunite with the main fleet, my position becomes redundant."
"Regardless of how short you get to enjoy your temporary powers, it will be a valuable boon on your record. As long as you do a decent job, you’ll be on the shortlist whenever Professor Velten needs someone to take charge of something. That’s what Bovis and Emlanin are scheming for. They’ll do anything to secure this opportunity."
"Then it’s good that I’ve appointed Mr. Mercator and Miss Trozin as my deputies." Ves grinned. "After all, even if they lost their duels, they achieved the best overall results. It’s only fair to assign some responsibilities to them, and that’s the key. I’ve curtailed most of their options, since if they try to screw something up, it will inevitably reflect on their performance instead of mine."
Iris hummed on that. "Keep your friends close and keep your enemies closer. That’s a double-edged sword, you know. Enemies this close can easily stab you in the back when you least expect it, sir. I’m not saying you’ve taken the wrong course of action, but your approach leaves you with few friends and even fewer allies."
"That’s a fair point." Ves grunted. "At first, I wanted to elevate Pierce as one of my deputies, but he doesn’t have the stomach for it. He would do an awful job if I forced the responsibility on his shoulders."
While Ves couldn’t call Pierce his friend, he felt he could trust the man somewhat. It was too bad that Pierce wasn’t up to the task. He grew up under his father who was a mech designer from the Friday Coalition and enjoyed an enormous advantage in his upbringing that others would kill for. Despite his generous endowments, Pierce turned out to be no better than a mech designer from the Republic.
This basically proved that Pierce lacked the drive, talent and ability to be a good deputy to Ves. Forcefully elevating him to a position beyond his means would invite a lot of criticism about nepotism. It would also undermine the principle of strength that Ves leaned on to secure his leadership role.
Ves rubbed his head. "All this politicking is a pain in the butt. Why can’t people accept my appointment with grace? From what I’ve witnessed, the Vandals never question their superiors."
"It’s because mech pilots are simple brutes, sir. They don’t have any complicated thoughts. Mech officers gained their position because they’re better pilots or better commanders. Their strength in these qualities directly affect the survival of their subordinates. In the perspective of mech pilots, if their mech officer screws screws up, they die."
"In contrast, if the designer screws up, other people die." Ves added succinctly. "My screw-ups won’t affect Mercator and Trozin’s lives. They’ll be rooting for my downfall regardless of the human cost."
"I can see Bovis might be ambitious enough to do that, but Emlanin definitely won’t. She’s too attached to the Vandals to put their lives at risk. That’s not to say that you shouldn’t worry about her. I’m acquainted with her enough to know that she’s like a viper in the grass. She won’t attract any attention while she lies in wait, but she’ll deliver a fatal blow when the time is right."
That sounded somewhat worrisome to Ves, but not to the point where he felt ill at ease. Whatever crisis may come his way, he’d deal with it like he dealt with every crisis.
Ves turned his attention back to his work. The recent conference meeting settled the leadership issue. Not only did he introduce some new policies, he also issued a set of preliminary orders. Right now, every mech designer should be facilitating the transition to a new resource management system.
The new software shared the similar capabilities to the old one, but put more emphasis on different priorities. In particular, the new software offered better tracking of the input and output of a production process.
For example, if someone put 100 tons of raw material in a machine and spat out 20 tons of product and 79 tons of waste, there was an obvious discrepancy of 1 ton of materials. Where did missing ton this end up? The new software wouldn’t let the operators get away with this without immediate alarm.
Of course, this was an extremely simplified example. In practise, the perpetrators wouldn’t be stupid enough to leave such an obvious trail. Nonetheless, the new software had seemingly been geared against untrustworthy subordinates. It left the machine operators with much less leeway to pull something off.
Ves hoped that everyone got the message that he tried to convey with this change. It wasn’t a coincidence he opted for this particular software package.
"Now that all of the distractions are out of the way, it’s time for me to start my planning."
His main responsibility as a head designer was to plan out the task force’s mech composition. This was an exceedingly complex task as Ves needed to take into account the skillsets of each mech company, the resources at his disposal, Major Verle’s priorities and the mech composition of their opponents.
The latter element introduced a lot of complexity to the challenge. Its introduction turned the chessboard from a solo game to a competitive game. Ves needed to anticipate the mech models that the different duchies would bring to bear against the task force.
"Iris." Ves turned away from his terminal. "Can you tell me about the territories that the Vandals will likely pass by on their way to the Reinald Republic?"
"You’re curious about the duchies, sir?"
"Yes. I a better understanding of their traits and mech doctrine in order to plan against their retaliation."
"Hm, I’ve been thinking about that as well." Iris said. "While I can’t say for sure which territories we’ll cross, there is only one practical route if we wish to reach the Reinald Republic within two months. We’ll encroach upon the territories of four duchies in total."
She sent him some files that enumerated these duchies.
"First up, there’s the Imodris Duchy. They form one of the pillars of the Vesia Kingdom because of their strength and core position. Imodris is also very prosperous because it jointly controls one of the Kingdom’s two port systems. This has led them to pursue a balanced mech doctrine. The Duchess of Imodris feels that she doesn’t need to focus her budget and research initiatives on only a handful of mech types. Her territory has the resources to pursue everything."
Ves nodded in understanding. Bentheim was the same. The sheer amount of prosperity and the abundance of private industries fostered a very diverse development climate climate. "That lack of specialization will still have consequences, though. A jack of all trades is strong at nothing."
"True, but you shouldn’t underestimate the Imodris Legions regardless. Each complete legion is capable of fulfilling any role on the battlefield."
"I’m fairly familiar with Imodris already, you don’t need to explain that. Since we struck their star system, it’s likely that they’ve got a fire lit under their butts. The Duchess of Imodris is a ruthless lady from what I heard, so she’ll definitely try to catch up to us."
"While that’s true, the Duchess sent her strongest legions to the frontlines. While she’s still holding back her crack troops, she needs them to defend her powerbase."
The Vandals needed more time to recuperate. They just completed a massive operation, and while they achieved all of their objectives, they also faced some unexpected setbacks. The mech pilots needed rest and the mechs needed to be fixed up.
"I really hope she’s not crazy enough to send in her elites, then. We’re almost out of her hair anyhow." Ves sighed. "What’s the next territory in our way?"
"Next up is the Venidse Duchy, which is another Vesian core territory. They’re almost as strong as the Imodris Duchy. The two territories are rivals in fact, but the difference is that the Venidse Duchy doesn’t have the advantage of a port system."
"How come Venidse can match up to Imodris then?"
Iris smirked. "That’s because the Vendise Duchy enjoys a high endowment of natural resources, though not to the point where they can match the benefits of a port system. Nevertheless, Venidse holds their own against Imodris because the duchy adheres to a very disgusting mech doctrine."
"That’s an interesting choice of words." Ves chuckled. "Tell me more about this disgusting doctrine."
"Well sir, their rationale is like this. No matter what kind of mechs Imodris throws at them, the Venidse Mech Legions will always be able to come up with a response if they slow their opposition down. Venidse is all about attrition warfare. They will do everything in their power to pull their enemies into a quagmire. Once their opponents fall into their trap, the Venidse mechs will grind them all to pieces."
"Okay, I see now why you call that disgusting. If that’s their main mode of combat, then every skirmish against Venidse will always spiral out of control. Their enemies need to think twice before they decide to engage in combat against their forces."
"It’s a good thing that their doctrine has a lot of holes. Their mechs are geared towards endurance, so their burst performance is atrocious. They highly lean on laser weapons because they last longer, but that also means that you can prepare an easy counter against them."
"I suppose it’s not as easy as that." Ves commented. "If their strategy is so one-dimensional, they don’t have the grounds to compete against Imodris."
"That’s right. There’s a tricky aspect to Venidse’s mech doctrine."
"The Venidse Mech Legions try their best to pull their enemies into a contest of attrition. They’re good at slowing or hindering their opposition so that they won’t be able to get away in time. Once they’ve trapped the enemy mechs, they’ll deploy their killer strike."
"Ah, the old classic hammer and anvil tactic." Ves nodded in recognition. "The anvil pins the enemy forces in place while the hammer slams them from the rear."
"I wouldn’t it a hammer, sir. It’s more of a poisonous dagger. Venidse is very good at forming stealth squads that act like commandos. These stealth mechs are piloted by exquisitely-trained elites who make it their life’s work to sabotage critical enemy infrastructure. They have a habit of assassinating enemy leaders if they can get away with it. Their stealth technology is so good that they’ve become something of a terror."
"I have to admit, that sounds very dreadful." Still, Ves recognized a couple of shortcomings. "Venidse must have poured a lot of resources and training into establishing these stealth squads. They should be their most prized elite. If it isn’t necessary, they would not deploy these precious mechs."
Stealth mechs gained the ability to avoid detection by sacrificing their armor. Instead of utilizing conventional armor plating, they replaced them with active stealth plating. This turned them into fragile machines that absorbed less damage than a light mech.
A surprise attack involving an entire squad of stealth mechs needed to be planned and carried out to perfection, because it wasn’t cheap to build them up. Any failure reflected badly on the commanding officer.
The question was whether Venidse found it worthwhile to commit their most valuable stealth units to stop the Vandals in their tracks.
"We’ve got to hope for the best but plan for the worst." Ves summed up. "While there’s no guarantee that Venidse will go as far as to employ their stealth mechs against us, we should bolster our stealth countermeasures regardless."
Even so, countermeasures only worked up to a point. Since Venidse committed to this strategy, they would have gained a lot of proficiency in developing countermeasures against the countermeasures.
"Ugh, that’s another headache." Ves rubbed his head. "Is there anything else about Venidse that I should take into account?"
"Not really, boss."
"Okay, so after passing through Imodris and Venidse, what’s the next territory in our way?"
"That should probably be the Klein Duchy, sir. Different from the other two duchies, the Klein Duchy is a peripheral territory. It falls outside the core regions of the Kingdom and isn’t as prosperous or as developed. It occupies a lot of space, though. We’ll have to spend some time traversing their domain."
Ves read up on the Klein Duchy on his terminal. It was larger but sparser, sort of like a backwater region to the Vesian core region. It didn’t offer any noteworthy resources or industries.
"The Klein Duchy isn’t an economic powerhouse, so they can’t be as wasteful as Venidse which happily engages in costly battles of attrition. They’ve poured their limited resources into their long-ranged firepower doctrine. Their main mechs are lightly armored but have extreme reach reach. They favor keeping their enemies in sight and at long range. The moment any mechs come closer, they collectively pull back in order to maintain their range advantage."
Ves laughed at that. "What a conservative strategy! Sure enough, the Klein forces will be able to maintain their strength this way, but will lead to a lot of lost ground as well. They can’t keep backing off in a defensive situation. They have to stand their ground in some cases."
"Oh, they do maintain some decent defensive units, but they’re fairly bog standard so you don’t need to employ a specific strategy against them. Klein focuses most of their development in strengthening their long-ranged units, and to be fair they’ve become quite good at that. They mainly rely on lasers because their beams travel at light speed, but they also throw in plenty of kinetic and explosive firepower into the mix. Their heavy artillery mechs form the crown jewels to every mech legion."
Their long-ranged prowess sounded very worrisome. They couldn’t let the Klein mechs pull the Flagrant Vandals into their game. Ves started flitting through ideas. "Light mechs will do the job. They’re fast and their high evasion will allow them to close the distance."
"Oh, don’t rely on light mechs only, boss. Plenty of enemies have tried to do so, but the House of Klein still manages to hang on to their duchy. I suggest you read up on their past battles to find out how they dealt with light mechs."
Iris reminded Ves that he shouldn’t take these generalizations as truth. The territories adopted these mech doctrines as a high-level development strategy. The actual mech forces at their disposal doubtlessly exhibited a greater variety of mech types. In addition, private sector outfits pursued their own strategies that might run counter to that of the military.
It would be a mistake to paint every duchy in a broad stroke.
"Even though the Klein Duchy sounds fairly tricky, they’re not as strong as Imodris and Venidse, right?"
"That’s correct, sir. The Klein Duchy needs to defend a lot more territory but has fewer mech legions at their disposal. The only downside is that they haven’t sent as much mechs to the frontlines as the core regions, so there is probably a high chance we will bump into one of their patrols."
Ves took note of that and more. Plans continued to whirl inside his mind, and the more he learned, the more he fleshed out his own strategies.
"Then if that’s all there is to Klein, what’s the next territory in the way?"
"The Hafner Duchy borders the Klein Duchy on one end and the Reinald Republic on the other end. It’s a border territory, and is as sparse as the Klein Duchy. The only problem is that because it borders the Reinald Republic, the Kingdom subsidizes its mech forces in order to strengthen their border defenses. Hafner is therefore stronger than Klein, though their military can’t match up against Imodris or Venidse."
"So what are they good at?" He asked. There was no way their final stop would be so simple.
"Hafner’s mech legions are geared towards deterrence and anti-piracy efforts. They follow a two-pronged mech doctrine. First, they employ a lot of light mechs. Skirmishers, saboteurs, light riflemen, you name it, Hafner has it. Their light mechs never gather together in the scale of regiments or legions, but rather operate in smaller batches in order to patrol the border systems and chase after individual pirate ships."
"I see. Since these light mechs are aimed towards pirates, they don’t fare well against a frontline mech regiment."
"True, but don’t forget the Flagrant Vandals isn’t a normal mech regiment either." Iris warned. "Our mech composition is ideal for raiding, which just happens to match the modus operandi of pirates. In Hafner’s eyes, the Flagrant Vandals are no different than pirates. We’re just better organized, that’s all."
Just like how the Vesian mech forces became good at some aspects and bad in other aspects, the Vandals exhibited their own dimensionality. As a raiding regiment, they exhibited a lot of speed, but wouldn’t last in a battle against tough opposition.
The Hafner mech legions pursued a familiar mech doctrine to the Vandals.
"Hafner has an enormous hatred against pirates because they suffer a lot from their raids near the border. You can imagine that their light mechs are all fast. Yet anti-piracy is only one of their missions. They need to show off their strength against the foreign states at the border as well, so they’ve poured in some of their resources in hard-hitting cavalry."
In mech terminology, cavalry meant mechs that hit hard and fast.
"Ah, so they’re focused on shock attacks, is that right?"
"Guessed it right, boss." Iris nodded with a smile. "As you can imagine, the Hafner shock troops are predominantly medium mechs that excel in charges. They take some time to build up their momentum, but once they get going, they’re almost impossible to stop without suffering more damage in the process. Still, Hafner hasn’t managed to circumvent the shortcomings around this strategy."
Medium mechs that specialized in shock attacks didn’t necessarily have to be light, but they couldn’t carry too much armor either. Most of the time, their frontal armor was very decent, but their flank and rear armor was as thin as light mech armor.
Furthermore, while these mechs exhibited a high level of peak performance, they quickly ran out of steam. They never lasted very long in battles of attrition.
Despite these obvious weaknesses, Ves kept frowning as he mulled over Hafner’s mech doctrine. "They don’t sound very defensive."
"That’s because they believe a good defense is a good offense. Hafner is very aggressive. They attack in order to defend."
Out of all the mech doctrines that Iris listed out, Ves worried about the one developed by the Hafner Duchy the most. The Flagrant Vandals could easily manage to work around the other doctrines, but the strategies employed by Hafner formed a direct counter.
"The final step will be the hardest. Out of all the different territories in our projected route, the Hafner Duchy poses the highest threat to us."
As mech designers, both of them understood what a bad matchup it was. If Hafner brought enough mechs to bear on the Vandals, the task force’s very existence was at stake.
More than that, Hafner’s extensive focus on chasing pirates turned them into excellent trackers as well. Ves imagined that the Vandals wouldn’t be able to hide from Hafner’s scrutiny as they tried to cross their territory. Several pitched battles might very well erupt between them before the Vandals finally reached the Reinald Republic.
Ves scratched his chin. His plan needed to be changed now that he became aware of Hafner’s strengths. "Every territory is challenging, but it’s important to maintain our strength up to the end. We need all of the mechs we can get to get through Hafner’s blockade."
He dove into his studies and investigated the territories further. Now that Iris provided an introduction on each of them, Ves had no trouble interpreting the data. He drew on the central database of the Mech Corps to obtain estimates on the mech disposition of each duchy.
"Damn!" Ves exclaimed. "The Hafner Duchy hasn’t shifted any of their mech legions to the front! They’re essentially at full strength!"
Iris was already aware about this fact. "It wouldn’t make sense for the Hafner mech legions to cross the entire Kingdom to reinforce the front. They have their own responsibilities. The Duke of Hafner won’t be able to reassign too many mechs from the border. Otherwise, the Reinald Republic and its neighbors might take advantage somehow."
Perhaps that might be a silver lining to the Flagrant Vandals. Iris was right in that most mechs that belonged to Hafner needed to defend the border. They wouldn’t easily be pulled from their posts to pursue the the elusive Vandals.
"Okay, so we still have a chance."
As long as they had an opening, Ves would do his best to squeeze the Vandals through the gap. He refined his understanding of the opposition and dove into the disposition of the Vandals. By comparing them with each other, he drew up a variety of ideas.
Not all of them would be workable. The most ideal solutions also happened to be the most expensive ones. Ves was forced to discard most of his fantasies because the Vandals faced a lot of limitations.
"This is harder than I thought."
Ves hadn’t even factored in the expert pilots yet. Every expert pilot was unique, and most of the times their mechs didn’t conform to conventional strategies. Ves had never seen Venerable O’Callahan in action. The one time when the Vandals wanted him to deploy, he outright refused to exit the ship.
"I’m going to have to talk to his design team." He grumbled.
He wanted to know why they guzzled up so many resources.
While the Flagrant Vandals split their fleet in two, the ripple effects of the Detemen Operation still reverberated in the Vesia Kingdom and the Bright Republic.
The two third-rate states had been locked in a perpetual cycle of war and peace, and even the peace was a lie. Through centuries of war, they experienced a lot of events. The Vesians always put the Bright Republic on their back foot, and if not for the upswing in desperation among the Brighters to stem the tide, the Republic might not be standing anymore.
The entire Komodo Star Sector already became engulfed in war. Besides certain exception such as the isolationist Ylvain Protectorate that bordered the Republic on the side, most states entered into a conflict of some sort.
The conflict between the Vesians and the Brighters might as well be a scuffle between toddlers compared to the clash of the two giants of the Komodo Star Sector. The multifaceted Friday Coalition threw tens of thousands of ships and millions of mechs against the unitary might of the Hexadric Hegemony.
Whenever the rest of the Komodo Star Sector watched these behemoths wage war, they felt envious and afraid. None of them could withstand the destruction being wrought after a single day of combat.
"The Coalition and the Hegemony are the only states in the Komodo Star Sector worth a damn."
The Glowing Planet Campaign brought their conflict to the fore, and messed up their well-laid plans. The rogue planet’s value couldn’t be underestimated, and both sides ruthlessly carved out city-sized chunks from the floating rock in space until they stripped its crust, demolished its mantle and crushed its core.
An enormous amount of low-value exotics came into their possession, more than enough to enhance the performance of millions of mechs. More than that, they also obtained a generous stock of high-value exotics, most notably Rorach’s Bone with suffused the core of the planet for some reason.
Mech manufacturers and military design teams already started incorporating the wondrous substance into their mechs. Blending trace amounts of Rorach’s Bone into their mechs enhanced the durability of alloys and opened them up to resonance.
When mech designers made use of Rorach’s Bone as a core material, then the designs they put out achieved a myriad of wondrous effects. The mechs became capable of self-repair over time if fed with energy. The machines also became highly conductive to resonance, though it was generally thought to be wasteful to utilize the material to facilitate fake resonance.
In short, the battle between elites took on a new dimension with the introduction of Rorach’s Bone and other exotics. The mechs piloted by expert and ace pilots became tougher. The extra materials also amplified their resonance effects, which led to devastating massacres if these elite mechs ever deployed against standard mechs.
"Normal mech pilots have become ants in the battlefield! This is an era of gods and heroes!"
The Titanium Garden. A massive artificial planet composed out of a massive amount of titanium, which was one of the more valuable mundane materials in the galaxy. A huge expense had been made to fashion such a planet out of nothing, and the worst thing about it was that it served little practical use.
Who was crazy enough to build their own artificial planet when the galaxy possessed trillions of them? Anyone wealthy enough could lay a claim on a lifeless rock that orbited a random star and build them into their own domain.
Only those with sick minds or something to prove bothered with the extravagance of building their own planet.
Many citizens of the Coalition spoke of the former. Master Carmin Olson threw an enormous amount of money in the drain just to satisfy her vanity. That and other extravagant purchases shortly after her elevation to Master Mech Designer branded her with the reputation of a profligate diva.
Olson cared little for the opinions of the masses. Her thoughts and calculations took place on a higher level than normal human beings. In fact, it was doubtful that she could even be considered a member of the human race. Though outwardly she looked like a woman in her prime with a different color of hair each day, inwardly her genes and flesh had underwent a huge transformation.
Despite their enormous progress in this area, mankind still dabbled in the art of modifying their frail bodies. Mech designers mainly focused on enhancing their longevity and intellect, but both of them were still fairly poorly understood. These modifications often introduced strange and incidental side effects, which most often expressed itself as a physical mutation or a mental disorder.
Nobody to call Master Olson insane, though the thought sometimes flitted in their minds. In any case, she comported herself as a human when she met with others, and that was sufficient to allay people’s worst fears.
Much of the upper portion of the Titanium Garden consisted of spatially confusing latticeworks.
Beams of titanium crossed or meshed into each other in an intricate geometric pattern that hinted at a profound mathematical truth of the multiverse.
These beams supported a small number of great islands covered by all manner of greenery. In one of the larger islands, a highly secure vault surrounded by many layers of titanium and compressed alloys, Master Olson led her youngest disciple inside.
"Carminnnn, I’m bored! Why I can’t I go off to the frontlines or visit my good friend Ves?"
A fair feminine hand gently smacked the adolescent man in the face. "Address my properly, Oleg."
"Oowww! Sorry Master!"
Master Olson tediously went through the process of unlocking the mech-sized vault doors. "You have just advanced into the ranks of Journeyman Mech Designer. This marks your transformation from a learner of the arts into a full-fledged creator of wonders. From the perspective of the mech industry, you’ve grown from a teenager and reached adulthood."
"Does that mean you’re a granny?"
"Ooww!"
Olson gave her direct disciple another slap, though her motions possessed a touch of playful indulgence.
"Progressing up the ranks isn’t an advancement of age. It is a transformation of the mind. Do you think you are the same young boy as before? Your knowledge and skills surpass almost everyone in the Komodo Star Sector, and that disparity will only grow in the future. You must become more aware of your place in the galaxy."
"And what is my place? Competing at the Rimward Games? Oh please, I’ll breeze through that show in a jiffy."
"There are more freaks and talents than you, Oleg. Do not think you are unique among every mech designer in the galactic rim. Even within the Coalition, you still need to defeat your rivals in order to obtain the nomination to represent our state."
"Don’t remind me." Oleg grumbled. A human with an abnormal level of intelligence like his was rare, but not unique.
Many more mutations and deviations from the norm existed as well. Most abnormal humans suffered from detrimental mutations due to exposure to dangerous exotic substances or exceedingly rare stellar radiation. Only a tiny portion lucked out and benefited from a beneficial mutation.
No one could explain Oleg’s anomalous level of cognition. His parents were normal citizens of the Coalition, and they lived on a quiet planet under the Vermeer Group for decades.
The most plausible idea any researcher came up with was that Oleg’s mother became exposed to a bizarre ray of energy that transformed the fetus inside her womb a short time after conception. It was as good of an explanation as any, because no one succeeded in replicating the phenomenon.
The pair remained quiet until Master Olson finished unlocking the vault doors. The huge mechanisms behind the doors moved the enormous obstacles around until the way forward became unbarred.
"Let us enter."
The two strode forward with measured steps. The metallic compressed armor that formed the floor of this vault clanked with sharp noises as the two mech designers entered the dark and hollow vault chamber.
They passed through another set of gates before they entered the inner vault, which held the only prize in this enormous structure.
Arrayed before them stood a transparent case made out of extremely durable composites. Oleg didn’t recognize their exact formula, but he recognized the expensive of this glass-like material. It could even give compressed armor a run for their money!
Yet what the mech-sized construction encased blew away his mind. Oleg guessed plenty of possibilities of what lay inside the vault that Master Olson wanted him to see. He guessed that it might be some sort of historic mech, or maybe an exclusive new machine made entirely out of Rorach’s Bone.
Never would he have expected to witness a giant, mech-sized skeleton. The sheer size of it sent existential tremors through Oleg’s mind. His mentality received a substantial amount of strengthening upon elevation to Journeyman, but in the face of this once-living humanoid giant, all of his confidence bled away like nothing.
"W-W-What is this, Master?!"
"It is a skeleton. The Coalition fleets retrieved it from the crumbling remains of the Glowing Planet. It was buried deep within the core, and was almost discarded as waste as it was buried beneath trash materials."
"It’s remarkably intact. If not for the hole at the top of its skull, it would have been an excellent display at a galactic museum." Oleg commented as his fascination never ceased. The skeleton of this massive being possessed some sort of compulsive charm that spoke of absolute dominance. "Do you know anything about its race?"
Master Olson stayed impassive as she stared at the giant. Unlike Oleg, Olson viewed the giant as her equal rather than a superior biological being.
"There are secrets surrounding this race, and much of them are out of my reach. The MTA has expressed an enormous interest in the remains. The Coalition has come to an agreement to let every Master Mech Designer study the remains for month before selling it to the Association."
Oleg looked really impressed now. "It’s that valuable?"
"It may even be the only prize we’ve obtained that is worth mentioning from the Glowing Planet. Rorach’s Bone may be rare in the galactic rim, but it is still a commodity in the end."
A few seconds passed in silence before Oleg spoke up again.
"This thing looks like an upscaled human skeleton. Are we.. related somehow?"
"We don’t know. Perhaps the MTA might know more, but have decided to withhold the answer for some reason. Yet... my intuition says that it is not a coincidence. I’ve spoken about it often with my colleagues and the possibility that frighten them the most is that it is the forefather to all humanoid life in the galaxy!"
"That’s huge!" Oleg exclaimed. He couldn’t fathom the connection between this race of giants and modern humanity, but if a link between the two existed, then everyone’s conception of what it meant to be human needed to be dumped in the trash! "Err but wait, what are you doing with this skeleton then? Shouldn’t it be studied by exobiologists or something?"
"We’ve already set some exobiologists loose, but their results are inconclusive. The mysterious surrounding this skeleton is far beyond the means of the Coalition. Let the MTA puzzle about its origins. The true value of this skeleton is that it is a remnant of a being the size of a mech. Do you understand the importance of that to us?"
They were mech designers, not exobiologists. They poured over mech designs for a living, so Oleg didn’t need to think very hard to come up with a guess. "You mean, we can study this skeleton to improve our ability to design mechs?"
"There is more to it than that, but that is essentially correct." Master Olson nodded. "There are layers of mysteries behind this skeleton. For the time being, you and your fellow disciples will remain here to peel back as many layers as you can. What you can learn from this ancient remains will depend on your luck and your thinking. No matter what you get out of this inspection, your mechs will never be the same."
Oleg nodded in a rare moment of solemnity. "I understand. I will do my best to understand this giant!"
He immediately dove into his own mental world as his eyes raked over the ancient bones. He may not know what intricacies they held, but hopefully he would obtain some clues that would help him clinch the upcoming nomination for the Rimward Games.
Elsewhere, the Bright Republic and the Vesia Kingdom long threw the fate of the Glowing Planet to the back of their minds. After all, once the two dominant second-rate states of the Komodo Star Sector laid claim to it, they lost rights to contend for ownership of the rogue planet.
The conversation of the day instead revolved around the daring raid of the Flagrant Vandals. This obscure mech regiment under the 3rd Tarry Division never registered in the minds of the Brighters. The Vesians were better acquainted with the Vandals, but often mistook them as wayward mercenaries gone pirate.
Their time of obscurity was a thing of the past. The bombastic events at the Detemen System opened everyone’s eyes to what this vagabond-like mech regiment was capable of. The
Vandals sneaked into the core regions of the Kingdom and wreaked havoc at the unsuspecting star system, smashing the garrison fleet in the process! Then they split up. The Vandals under the command of Major Verle overran a moon base, plunged a capital city into chaos, robbed half of its heavy industries of their assets and captured the planetary leader in a spectacular hunt!
Blood boiled in the citizens of the Republic!
"Hahaha! Look at how clueless they are when faced with an invasion! A planet of the republic would never fall into confusion like that when the Vesians intrude upon our star systems!"
"This is the true face of the Kingdom! For all their boasts, they live under a tyranny! How else is the rebellion so strong!"
"Who are the 6th Flagrant Vandals? I’ve memorized every mech regiment under the 3rd Tarry Division, but I always thought they were understrength!"
"They look like pirates with funding! Did we hire some washed-up frontier scum and organized them into a regiment or something? They’re way too good in raiding the entire place!"
"Did they really capture the heir of a count? The Vesians must be going mad right now!"
Each piece of news buoyed up the Republic’s flagging spirits. It provided them with a timely victory to stall the decline in confidence over the war.
While the accomplishments at Detemen IV attracted the most attention, the Vandals also inflicted a lot of damage at Detemen II. The resource-processing planet used to watch over a score of solar foundries. They utilized the incredible heat and energies from the binary stars to transform raw ores and metals into processed alloys.
All of them had been wrecked, which set back House Jier enormously. As the Vandals made landfall on the scorching hot planet, Count Reizen proved himself to be the better of Lord Javier in every way by taking personal command over the defense of their valuable renewable exotics mine.
There was little of value to be found on the surface of Detemen II, but the renewable exotics mine stood out as a massive outlier. Sources of endless exotics were rare, as most of them formed in extreme and highly peculiar situations at the center of the galaxy. The galactic rim only uncovered exotics from ancient stellar objects flung from the center to the outer portions of the galaxy many eons ago.
While stars and planets still ejected from the fulcrum of the center of the galaxy on a regular basis, they always got lost in the vastness of the galactic rim.
The renewable exotics mine was a unique byproduct of a set of coincidences in the galactic center. It was very rare, and formed the basis of House Jier’s long-term prosperity. Every force aligned to the House pulled back from defending unimportant facilities in order to safeguard the mine.
They failed. Over two days of hard fighting where Colonel Lowenfield ordered the launch of several waves of artificial asteroids, the defenses around the mine finally crumbled in the face of Vandal determination. Count Reizen’s custom mech fled through a tunnel in a bedraggled state, leaving the mine exposed to the Vandals.
Nobody knew what happened to it. Some people guessed that the mine hid some sort of natural treasure that was responsible for making the mine renewable. In any case, the mine lost its essential quality, and no longer generated new junk exotics. Once House Jier mined all of the the existing deposits, the mine became exhausted.
These accomplishments fully smacked the face of the Vesians, who had grown arrogant at their continued successes at the frontlines. Their indomitable fleets and mechs slowly pushed forward since the outbreak of the war, but the sudden raid on the Detemen System poured cold water over their shoulders. The shock was too great that some of the Vesians pulled back their aggression. This unintentionally gave the Mech Corps a rare and precious moment of reprieve.
This highlighted the power of the dissemination of information. In an age where every planet was connected to a vast galactic network, every citizen and serviceman became easily swayed by the news, rumors and propaganda circulating in the void.
Joshua finished reading the news bulletins in his comm and felt his blood boil. Right now, he attended a military-funded mech academy that rushed their mech cadets through years of training.
Many promising cadets couldn’t handle the pressure. They washed out after a couple of weeks of high-intensity training and got kicked back to their home star systems.
Though Joshua turned out to be of average ability and talent, his willpower and grit impressed the instructors. Through hard work and focused training, he kept up with the grueling pace and accepted every abuse the instructors flung in his way.
He would not be deterred. It was a dream for a native from Cloudy Curtain to attend a mech academies in Bentheim, and he resolved to never squander it. For it is in this ruthless pace of training that Joshua improved the fastest.
"Damnit." He cursed as he browsed at his rankings in Iron Spirit. "I’m still too far away from unlocking 5-star mechs."
Nobody in his class understood his drive. Joshua felt a little ashamed in telling his fellow cadets why he trained so hard. The main reason why his willpower pushed him through was because he wanted to unlock the ability to pilot the LMC’s best virtual mechs!
Sadly, it appeared that it would take at least another year for him to improve enough to escape the bottom of the Gold League. Joshua regularly competed against mech pilots at least three years older than him. Only until he could overcome this barrier would he be able to enter the Gold League properly, thereby qualifying him to pilot Iron Spirit’s 5-star mechs.
"The Marc Antony Mark II, the Blackbeak, the Crystal Lord... why are you still so far away?"
The latter two products gained an enormous amount of fame in the mech industry. Joshua wasn’t too exposed to that, but even he heard plenty of stories about their excellence. Even the hardcore virtual athletes started to take note of the Blackbeak and the Crystal Lord. Out of all of the virtual designs published by Chasing Clouds, it was these two that formed the crown.
While Joshua dreamed of piloting the the LMC’s wonder mechs, elsewhere on Bentheim two women met each other at a quiet rooftop cafe. Among the elegant plants and wood-fashioned furniture, the women stared at each other with varying levels of tension.
"Melinda."
"Raella."
The two Larkinsons happened to grow up together as their ages closely matched. Nonetheless, their current occupations couldn’t be more different.
"How’s the Guard?"
"It’s been hectic, and it doesn’t help that I’ve been promoted to lieutenant." Melinda replied as a couple of service bots floated into their midst and delivered some refreshments. "Thank heavens for the Flagrant Vandals. They’ve lifted everyone’s moods so there’s fewer troublemakers out there trying to make a fuss with their mechs."
Raella grinned as she sipped on a multicolored smoothie. "Heh, the Vandals really sound like my kind of people. If I knew they existed, I would have signed up to them instead! Not that I’m unhappy with my current lot. I’ve finally been able to pursue the duelling career that I’ve always dreamed about."
Melinda pressed her lips. "Yes. A mech duelist. What a wonderful career. Yet I don’t see your matches on the galactic net."
"That would spoil the whole show! The underground duelling circuit isn’t about reaching the highest amount of viewers. It’s about experiencing the exhilarating clash of multi-ton machines close-up and personal, where lives are at stake! There’s no substitute for that kind of rush!"
"It’s too dangerous! It only takes one accident to claim your life! No one can win every duel. The Larkinsons back home are worried sick about you! Even if you renounced the Family, there’s still a place for you to return!"
"Hey, it’s not like everyone kills each other all the time in the underground duelling circuit." Raella waved away her cousin’s concern. "We only go through with it when the crowd is wild or someone pays me to do it. I don’t like to admit it, but my last name is a powerful talisman among the gangs. Nobody wants to piss off a Larkinson. They’re all afraid Uncle Ark will run out of Citadel Havensworth and crush their entire gang, haha!"
"That’s not funny. There are many insane duellists out there who don’t care a whit about the Larkinsons."
"Then you better avenge me, Guard Lieutenant Larkinson." Raella spoke with mirth.
Melinda sighed and stirred the spoon in her coffee cup. "Would you believe me if I told you that the Larkinsons are willing to subsidize your entry in a professional duelling team? You won’t be able to enter the Rittersberg or Bentheim circuits, but there are many teams elsewhere in the Republic that is looking for talent. Why don’t you think about it?"
"Nada. Absolutely not, Melly. I enjoyed my time in the amateur circuit, but I’ve already seen what a rotten place the pro games are. Sponsorships, merchandising, celebrity outreach, the entire circus around mech duels takes away from the actual fight. I’ve never felt more like a mech athlete until I began to take part in the underground duels. The gangs don’t bother so much with all of that commercial crap. They only care about entertaining rumbles!"
No matter how many times Melinda pleaded her cousin, Raella never relented from her stance. Her frequent duels finally injected a sense of confidence and self-worth in her bearing. She didn’t flinch at all in front of a lieutenant from the Planetary Guard.
"I’m my own person now! Even if the Vesians push through the frontlines come and try to take this life away from me, I’ll be joining the rest of the Blood Claws in thrashing them out of Bentheim! You can at least be assured of that!"
Both Larkinsons pursued different careers with success. They would never be able to see eye-to-eye with each other. If not for their shared family heritage, they would have never come together in the first place. Yet the bonds of family proved stronger than the animosity engendered by their professions.
More Larkinsons dealt with their own issues in life. Benjamin Larkinson, former expert pilot and one of the foremost heads of the Family, received a call from a surprising source.
"Miss Calsie, how are you today?"
"Not doing well, to be honest." She replied over the comm. Right now, she was calling from her office at the LMC in Cloudy Curtain to Benjamin who relaxed at the Larkinson Compound in Rittersberg. "I need your help with something."
"What is it?"
"The Ministry of Economic Development has been knocking at my doors to demand a stake in the LMC! It turns out we’ve become a bit too successful and eye-catching in their eyes, so now they want a piece of the pie!"
Benjamin instantly turned serious at that news. "As expected."
"You expected this?!"
"The Republic’s mech industry is too important to be allowed free reign. If you look closer at the ownership structure of other major mech manufacturer, the Ministry of Economic Development is a significant shareholder in all of those companies."
The news came at an enormous shock to Calsie, who never heard about this arrangement before. "Why didn’t Ves tell me about this?"
"Because it’s only relevant to mech companies that have reached a certain scale or developed something of strategic importance. The LMC should have been a few years away from growing large enough to attract attention, but perhaps some people have stirred things up in the background."
"According to the latest toady from the Ministry, since the Crystal Lord was the runner-up to the Best Mech Design of the Year award, we should be privileged to receive their care."
Her tone betrayed her cynicism at the Ministry’s offer. This was a typical case of suffering from too much success.
"I think you are mistaken about something, Calsie." Benjamin gently lectured. The old Larkinson wanted to be kind, but sometimes people needed to learn a harsh lesson. "For all the Bright Republic’s claims about upholding the standard of freedom, the government isn’t about to let an uncontrolled element have their way within their borders. The economy is always within their grip."
This really came as a surprise to Calsie. Previously, she was just a law graduate who turned into a temporary caretaker of a multibillion credit company. Though the responsibility initially overwhelmed her, she grew in the position with the help of capable friends within the LMC.
Now though, she found out that her vision was much too narrow. Like a frog within a well, she never became exposed to the truth about the Republic up until she hopped out of hole.
"What are my options?"
"As Ves’ agent, you’ll have to bend the knee in the face of authority. If the Ministry of Economic Development has their eyes on a stake in the LMC, then it’s best to accept the fact that Ves and you won’t enjoy an absolute majority anymore. How many shares are they demanding from Ves?"
"They’re asking for twenty-one percent, though it will be a different proportion if I choose to issue new stock."
"That’s their way of saying that no matter what kind of financial wizardry you pull off, they want to achieve an outcome where Ves no longer run his company like a tyrant."
"So they want to diminish Ves’ ownership in his own company until it dips into 49 percent?"
"That’s correct. You can decide to sell his shares or issue new stock. The former will swell his bank account while the latter will infuse new funds into the company. I don’t advise you to do the latter, and that’s not just because our Larkinson Estate will stand to lose. The Ministry of Economic Development often likes to meddle in how mech manufacturers are run, and they’ll demand you spend the influx of money into their pet projects."
This was valuable advice from an insider who walked the halls of power in Rittersberg. Calsie frowned at the old man’s words. She recognized their import, but Ves had insisted in the strongest terms to never sell away his shares.
"Ves will not be happy."
"Ves is not here. He appointed you as his agent for a reason. Even if it breaks one of his commands, you do not want to stand against the Bright Republic’s industrial policy. This is the way that almost every state works. The government doesn’t care about the small fries, but the moment a company grows to the point of being able to affect their prosperity, they will definitely take action. This is the reality of running a large corporation."
Calsie knew that this was no joke. Whenever the Bright Republic, they almost always knew what they were doing. They wouldn’t back off from this demand now that they issued it. The only thing she could do was to mitigate the damage.
"So how do I have to treat the negotiation between the LMC and the Ministry?"
"Fill in the Financial Department and the Legal Department and let them handle the details. Some of our retainers will know what to do. Whatever you do, don’t let the MoED run over you with their demands. Everything is negotiable, and their negotiators won’t push too hard if you demonstrate some spine."
"Why is that so?" Calsie frowned. "From what I’ve witnessed so far, they’re never satisfied with what’s on offer!"
"That’s because the Ministry is wary about chasing Ves from the Republic if they push him to the brink. It’s counterproductive for them to chase away a promising mech designer within their midst."
"Can we negotiate an alternative to giving up his majority stake?"
"That’s not possible. You should thank yourself that we live in the Republic. Many other states demand a much higher proportion of outstanding shares."
"So even if Ves decides to move the company’s assets and settle in another state, he’ll face the same thing over again, is that right?"
"It’s worse in that case, because a foreign entrant will always attract more scrutiny. It’s best for Ves to start anew in that case and found a new company from the ground up."
All of this largely neutralized the threat of moving their industries elsewhere. Calsie vaguely recognized a common understanding between the states. They kept their grasp on their domestic industries so long as everyone else played along.
"So how will the company be run from now on?"
"Well, the board of directors will have some actual teeth. The MoED will appoint some of their people to the board who will aim to steer the LMC in a way that benefits the Republic as a whole. This won’t always be good for Ves or the company, but they aren’t out to ruin your business either, so you don’t have to worry about that part."
"And if Ves or I disagree with their representatives?"
"Then it comes down to a vote. The main reason why the MoED wants to strip Ves’ majority is because they believe it is detrimental for a large company to be controlled by a single person. Even if Ves is the founder and lead designer, there are many companies that have ruined themselves in a single day due to missteps from the majority shareholder. The Republic doesn’t want its economy to turn into a commercialised version of the Vesia Kingdom. Power must be shared, and no one should have the ultimate say."
"Splitting up power comes with their own downsides. Ves has told me all about that when he prepared me for this job."
"And all of that is true, but in general the risks are minimized if the LMC transitions away from being under the reigns of someone who holds an absolute majority. With a controlling stake of 49 percent, you will need to think twice on every proposal you put forward, because you need to convince at least one of the other shareholders to go ahead with your ideas."
"That also means that the Larkinson Estate can collaborate with Mrs. Bollinger and the Ministry to vote through your own plans." Calsie incisively pointed out.
"That’s a distinct possibility. This is how actual corporations are run, you know. Even if the LMC went public, the MoED would still find a way to obtain at least ten percent of the shares."
"This is really unfair to Ves."
Benjamin smiled and shook his head. "Welcome to the big leagues."
As Calsie grappled with the fact that the LMC prematurely came to the MoED’s attention, Ves himself was oblivious to the possibility. He never studied the Republic’s laws to a great extent, and the lessons he learned when he attended school neglected to mention any of the sort.
It couldn’t be helped, since most graduates from the Rittersberg University of Technology never amounted to anything. Ves was in fact one of their most prominent alumni in the last decade.
If Ves attended the much more prestigious Ansel University of Mech Design on Bentheim, then he would have received some forewarnings about the Bright Republic’s economic and industrial policies.
Mech manufacturers played an extremely important role to a state. The fact that they mass produced machines of war only made the matter more important. No state wanted to have a rogue mech manufacturer within their borders selling dangerous mechs to pirates and every other type of scum.
It was no wonder states wanted to bring them to heel in some fashion.
Ves strode exited the shuttle and arrived at a special combat carrier called the Gorgon’s Gaze. As far as combat carriers went, she was as old as any other carrier owned by the Vandals. She possessed a balanced mix of attributes, though her designers put a light emphasis on speed over armor.
The Gorgon’s Gaze would have been an unremarkable combat carrier were it not for the fact that she hosted the task force’s only expert pilot.
Ves read up a bit on Rixt O’Callahan during the shuttle ride. The man was around a hundred years, but failed to prove himself worthy to anyone who would pay for any age-prolonging treatment.
While mech designers had easier access to these exclusive treatments, mech pilots needed to work much harder to obtain the same privilege. Their brains simply worked differently from normal humans and posed additional challenges to those who provided such treatments.
As Ves read through the expert pilot’s record, he found out the reason why nobody picked him up. At his prime, O’Callahan managed to resonate up to a strength of forty-four laveres. If he was able to maintain this level of resonance or continued to grow, then he might have been eligible to extend his biological lifespan.
Unfortunately, he only maintained his peak for a short amount of time. His mental faculties and his piloting ability started to slide. This was a cardinal sin among expert mech pilots because it signified that they exhausted their potential.
After bouncing around the Komodo Star Sector trying to convince others to invest in him, he finally returned to the Republic and accepted an invitation from the Vandals.
"This guy is pretty much a washed-up geezer among expert pilots."
That said, Venerable O’Callahan still possessed a formidable amount of strength, measuring up to thirty laveres on average. This meant his resonance was stronger than rookie expert pilots.
"The strength of resonance is only one factor in an expert pilot’s toolbox."
Other factors also played a role, from the quality of their mechs to the reflexes of the expert. A crude description of resonance was that it was responsible for giving an expert mech their superpowers. Even without this awesome power, an expert mech was still a dreadful machine to behold. The disparity only became a bit narrower if resonance was left out of the equation.
Though Ves had heard about Venerable O’Callahan’s irascable temper, he couldn’t ignore the massive drain on resources his presence demanded. For better or worse, Ves needed to talk to the expert pilot or someone from his entourage.
Some expert pilots cultivated their own team of mech technicians and mech designers, but O’Callahan lacked this luxury. Instead, the Vandals assigned their own people to serve the expert pilot.
Ves had scheduled a meeting with the head of his design team. Before he spoke with her, he first wanted to get a glimpse on the mech itself. He followed the route projected by his comm and entered into one of the hangar bays of the Gorgon’s Gaze. It was smaller than the other hangars, and was obviously arranged to service a single elite mech.
The thing that struck him the most was the mech itself. Ves finally got a glimpse of O’Callahan’s famed lancer mech, the Parallax Star. Venerable O’Callahan’s mech was basically a cavalry mech on steroids. It amplified the speed and impact damage of the mech. It could build up an incredible amount of speed and was able to pierce through heavy armor with ease with its foldable lance.
If the Parallax Star ever got caught up in a close-ranged duel, then it could retract the length of its lance or abandon it in favor of the backup spear attached to its back.
The mech possessed no ranged weapons of any kind, but this was less of a priority in spaceborn combat. That said, when Ves read up on the customized expert mech, he learnt that the Parallax Star could be converted into a capable aerial mech with some extensive modifications. This allowed the mech to remain relevant when it operated alongside landbound mechs.
As impressive as the Parallax Star sounded, Ves somehow felt that reality fell short. The magnificent burgundy-and-black expert mech looked worn and disjointed. To a layman, its outward appearance seemed fine, but to a skilled mech designer like Ves, the mech appeared to scream in pain.
"There’s something wrong here. This mech isn’t in a healthy state!"
When Ves extended his meager Spirituality at the mech, he encountered a morass of confusing portions. The mech’s intangible spirit wasn’t a morass of blended chaos like other mechs that had been worked on by many people. It contained portions of strong focus, but it was cut up in macabre pieces somehow.
Thus, both technically and spiritually, the Parallax Star exhibited a lot of flaws.
"What has its design team been doing?!"
A woman in her late thirties and a significantly older man wearing the coveralls of a chief technician arrived next to Ves, who still stared at the Parallax Star in fascinated horror.
The woman who wore the standard green uniform of a mech designer smiled and stepped forward. "Head Designer Larkinson, welcome aboard the Gorgon’s Gaze, home to Venerable O’Callahan and his Parallax Star. My name is Lisbeth Eta-Denmersken, and I’m the leader of the design team. This old man here is Chief Leo Keys."
Ves snapped out of his attempt to make sense of the mechanical butchery at the end of the hangar bay. "Chief Keys. Miss Eta-Denmersken. I’m.. glad to meet you."
"You can call us by our first names."
"Alright then. I’ve seen enough. Lead me to a compartment where we can discuss things in private."
As the pair guided Ves towards an unoccupied compartment meant for briefings, he considered how to approach their discussion. He already held some misgivings about the Parallax Star’s budget, and what he had just laid eyes on only furthered the sense of wrongness about the entire arrangement.
Once they seated themselves in the briefing room, Ves decided to ask the questions that needed to be asked. One way or another, Ves needed to determine if O’Callahan was squandering the precious resources given to him by the Vandals.
"Let me begin by saying as the new head designer, I expect you two to help me tide us all over until we complete our mission and return to Republic space. We’re deep into enemy space and cut off from easy access to supplies. We need to get used to leaner times for the next couple of months."
Lisbeth kept smiling at Ves as if she understood his pains. "We are understanding of the difficulties facing the fleet. However, Venerable O’Callahan will pull us through no matter how many Vesians stand in our way. You have nothing to worry about under his care."
This was not the direction that Ves was going for. "Miss Lisbeth, it is admirable for you to place so much faith in our resident expert pilot, but he is but one man among many. The main combatants will always be the regular mech pilots in our midst. The Venerable needs to save his strength and deploy only when necessary."
"That is exactly our thoughts." Lisbeth nodded, all the while she maintained that strange and incessant smile. "The Parallax Star is always ready to deploy. While it takes some time to rouse our Venerable into readiness, you can be assured that the mech under our care will always be in tip-top shape."
Ves awkwardly coughed. "I believe we should speak about the state of the Parallax Star, but first I’d like to address its budget."
"Oh?" Lisbeth smiled wider. "Have my requests for additional funding finally been accepted?"
"Sadly not. In fact, I am thinking about dialing your generous resource allowances."
Both Lisbeth and Chief Leo blinked at that. It was as if they never thought to hear something like that. The female mech designer’s eyes appeared completely befuddled, though she maintained her smile.
"Mr. Larkinson, that’s impossible!" Chief Leo uttered.
"Head Designer, you are new in your position." Lisbeth said in a gentle tone. "You might not have been briefed with the full scope of our activities yet, so let me explain to you what we do here."
She stood up and beckoned Chief Leo and Ves to follow her. They walked out of the briefing room and headed over to the Parallax Star. Once they reached the bottom of its feet, she put her hand over its surface.
"Look at this mech." She began. "Feel its heartbeat. Can you not tell how much care we put in its construction and maintenance? We polish it every day by hand to the point where it has become one of our rituals. The Parallax Star is designed by Professor Velten herself, and we are the executors of her will. This mech showcases the full potential of a Senior Mech Designer at work."
"That’s not all we put our work in." Chief Leo interjected. He walked away from the Parallax Star and headed over a partitioned section in the hangar bay. Come and see what we’ve prepared.
When Ves looked inside the partition, he became shocked at what he saw. "Are these.. spare parts?"
"Indeed!" Lisbeth clapped. "So far, we’ve prepared six lances, four short spears, three pairs of legs, seven pairs of arms, five flight systems and three heads. These only concern the outer parts. We have another space that’s devoted to storing internal parts such as engines or power reactors. All of these parts are of a different configuration, but all of them are compatible with the Parallax Star."
"It’s a semi-modular system that Venerable O’Callahan insisted that we implement." Chief Leo explained. "He wants to have the right tools available at the right time. For example, if O’Callahan needs to fight against an expert ranged mech, he’ll order us to configure the Parallax Star with parts that emphasize speed. If he needs to duel against a space knight, then the Parallax Star needs to focus less on speed and more on power and armor."
"How fast can you transition in a different configuration?" Ves asked.
"A simple switch will only take an hour or two at most. A more complex exchange of parts will take up to two days. We’re very proficient in this switch because we’ve trained on it endlessly."
"That’s too slow."
"Pardon?"
Both Chief Leo and Lisbeth couldn’t process his comment.
"I said, it’s too slow." Ves repeated bluntly. "The exact type of expert mech our enemies will deploy is often unknown until their combat carriers are close enough to launch their mechs to fight. Do you really think you have hours or days of preparation time to make your leisurely switch? Impossible! This exercise is horribly redundant and wasteful in terms of resources."
Chief Leo stopped smiling, but Lisbeth didn’t appear to be affected. She smiled at him in a different light, however. Before, she looked cordial and friendly. Now, her smiling expression took on a nefarious shade.
"Mr. Larkinson, as we said, you are new to your position. I am sure that if you study our methodology, it will begin to make sense. In any case, I will not allow you to make unilateral decisions without Venerable O’Callahan’s approval. In no way will he accept a cut in our budget."
His worst fears came true. Lisbeth Eta-Denmersken joined the cult of O’Callahan and became their head priestess. Ves turned to Chief Leo, but the old man silently shook his head and stood in a deferential manner behind Lisbeth. He had turned into a cultist as well it appeared.
"I don’t understand the need for more resources." Ves said, trying to approach this issue from another tack. "You’ve already fabricated loads of spare parts. It’s more than enough to handle any situation. Why do you insist on maintaining the same level of resource allocation?"
"Because it’s never enough." Lisbeth answered without any doubt. "Venerable O’Callahan wishes to expand his flexibility to the utmost. We must be ready to address any possible crisis. The more parts we prepare, the better we will be able to address a crisis in the future. It is like adding more tools in the toolbox. We may not need to make use of every tool, but the option is there when we need one of the rarer tools."
Ves shook his head. "That’s not how I see it. As far as I’m concerned, the Parallax Star only needs two or three tools to perform most of its jobs. Right now, you are reproducing multiple copies of nearly identical tools that solve the same problems! The toolbox is practically bursting apart!"
"We disagree. No matter what analogy you use, the only thing that matters is this is the will of Venerable O’Callahan."
"Okay then. Let me speak to him. Maybe I have better luck convincing the pilot."
"We refuse." Lisbeth responded with an irritated smile. "Venerable O’Callahan is far in his age and needs his precious rest. The longer he sleeps, the more his aging process slows down. Every minute awake is eating at his limited lifespan. I cannot in good faith allow you to rouse him from his slumber to make a request that we know for certain he will refuse. A budget cut is not in contention."
"What if I force this change over your protest?"
"Then the Verle Task Force will lose its only expert pilot."
"Maybe we’re better off that way. As far as I know, O’Callahan only deployed into combat a couple of times over the past five years. That’s an abysmally low deployment rate even for an expert pilot that needs to stay in reserve. There were several battles where our resident expert pilot’s intervention would have saved the Vandals a lot of pain."
The woman calmly retorted while maintaining her smile. "Expert pilots aren’t meant to hold our hands. They are the ultimate weapons to be used in the most dire threats to the Vandals. Intensive combat only accelerates his aging. His personal doctor has warned us that highly stressful moments may even accelerate the degeneration of his cognition and motor functions. Unless it is absolutely necessary, we will not allow Venerable O’Callahan to squander his life."
While the explanation made Ves more sympathetic to the expert pilot, he had grown under the auspices of several other expert pilots. He long outgrew the instinctual need to worship a strong pilot.
"Besides," Chief Leo spoke up. "The Venerable has long came to an arrangement with Professor Velten. She agreed to the existing terms in order to retain our expert pilot. This is not a deal you meddle with on your own."
Ves was afraid of that. O’Callahan obviously extorted an enormous amount of privileges from the Vandals, all the while he spent the majority of his time in sleep. The Venerable shamelessly squandered billions worth of high-quality exotics into fabricating endless spare parts, most of which would likely never even see any use!
Now he knew why the Parallax Star appeared to scream in pain. The mech was made out of disjointed parts, and had switched into a multitude of different configurations over and over again. Any mech would go mad with such senseless treatment.
Ves lamented the craftsmanship and expensive materials that went into their fabrication. Professor Velten demonstrated the prowess of a Senior Mech Designer in the Parallax Star’s design. It was too bad that most of it had gone to waste.
After half an hour of touring and fruitless pleading, Ves departed from the Gorgon’s Gaze with a drained expression.
"Crazy bint! And that old chief, why is he such a doormat?!"
Lisbeth Eta-Denmersken was obviously a lost cause. It was actually within his power to relieve the Apprentice Mech Designer from her current post. Ves toyed with the idea of pulling the trigger, but held off because he knew he would face a storm of protest from the design team and the Venerable himself.
Between Ves and O’Callahan, Major Verle would certainly choose to appease the latter. He needed the expert pilot’s protection, and that meant appeasing the senile mech pilot’s insane demands was a small price to pay for the mech officer.
As for Chief Leo, the easy-going old man was unlike every other chief technician he had seen. A chief needed to be authoritative and assertive in order to keep their mech technicians in line. Chief Leo demonstrated none of those qualities in front of Ves.
Both of them were problems to Ves. Perhaps no one aboard the Gorgon’s Gaze had the guts to stand up to Venerable O’Callahan. This bred a situation where his cult had firmly taken root on that combat carrier.
"This is an impossible situation."
While Ves was not resigned to give up, he had no choice but to address the matter at a later date. Right now, he lacked a silver bullet that could resolve the problem in his favor.
"How’s it looking, doc?"
"Some of your cells are wearing out faster than when you had your previous checkup. Your body is undergoing a subtle transformation. Towards what, we can’t determine, but whether it is beneficial or not is hard to say."
In other words, the doctor knew as much as anyone. Ves exited the scanning chamber and dressed himself in his green uniform.
"Have you made any progress in your research?"
"I’m afraid not. There is much we don’t understand about your so-called Jutland organ. All we can determine is that it contains an incredible amount of biological programming in an encrypted form. The good news is that it is largely dormant. The bad news is that anything can trigger some of the programming."
Nothing changed in that regard. Ves thanked the doctor for his work and left the Shield of Hispania’s medical bay.
Ves remained compromised due to his biological gifts from Dr. Jutland. He only hoped the doctor hadn’t put anything unpleasant in the programming. "He likely didn’t anticipate that I would be able to call for rescue."
The doctor wanted him to live on the hostile underground environment of Groening IV, so the Jutland organ probably wasn’t out to kill him. At least he hoped so. The madman might have included a failsafe in the energy organ’s programming that only its originator could resolve.
"I’ve got to get rid of this organ or at least decypher its programming."
This wouldn’t be easy. While the CFA took samples and cloned his body, Ves didn’t expect to hear from them again. He needed to solve this problem on his own initiative.
"I’ll need to enlist the help of a biomedical institution from the Friday Coalition at a minimum."
Not just anyone could knock on the doors of these prestigious institutions. Perhaps he could ask Master Olson for an introduction, but Ves preferred to solve his problems through his own means. As long as he progressed to Journeyman, a lot of doors would open for him in the Friday Coalition and in the Clifford Society.
"My best ticket to solve this problem is to earn lots of merits in the Society. As long as I have merits, I can spend them on exclusive services that aren’t open to regular people."
The more he saw of the galaxy, the more he understood the importance of relationships and networks. For example, the Flagrant Vandals could have never pulled off the Detemen Operation without cultivating an alliance with the Vesian Revolutionary Front.
Each of them excelled at something that the opposite party wanted to make use of. Recognizing this fact opened up an opportunity for mutual cooperation.
Ves needed to do the same with regards to puzzling out the secrets locked inside his body. The energy cycle quietly circulated within his chest without fail. Though his questionable ghost of a mother alleviated some of the pressure early on, it had already returned to its old level, and actually began to compress more energy in the cycle.
He was worried that the pressure would be too much one day and blow his entire body up.
While he didn’t know how much time he had left, he figured that he still had a good decade to go before some serious side effects cropped up.
"How did Dr. Jutland deal with this problem?"
The internal energy cycle must have been a deliberate design choice. Ves had the feeling he was missing something important. His body was basically an incomplete product.
To compare his current state to a mech, Ves imagined himself as a strengthened mech with a supercharged power reactor that constantly ran at full capacity. He didn’t possess any weapons or systems where he could drain all of his excess energy.
"Still, it’s dangerous to make too many assumptions about something I have no idea about."
For now, he pushed the issue to the back of his mind and turned back to the problems that fell within his area of expertise. After meeting the team that maintained Venerable O’Callahan’s Parallax Star, Ves mentally wrote them off as potential allies.
"Miss Lisbeth is a total cook and Chief Leo is a firm believer."
Ves heard about how people would go crazy around expert pilots from his family. In the Age of Mechs, the popularity of mechs was at an all-time high. The norms worshipped the mech pilots, and the mech pilots worshipped the expert pilots.
It was almost impossible for an advanced mech pilot to succeed in breaking through an expert pilot. Their rarity and miraculous circumstances turned every expert pilot in an object of envy. Some people equated them to demigods for their amazing skill and mythical abilities.
When Ves returned to his office, he greeted Iris and looked at her with appreciation. He found her presence to be remarkably helpful. She stopped being annoying once she saw that her attempts to get him to waver in his loyalties only made him more suspicious.
Now that she became the perfect assistant to him, Ves truly appreciated the benefit of having a second mech designer at his beck and call. He could tell her to relay his instructions to others and take care of all manner of trivial tasks. He could talk advantage of her connections and friendships within the Vandals and the VRF.
Most importantly, she was a pretty decent mech designer as well, so Ves often used her as a sounding board for some of his ideas.
"I’m at my wits end with the Venerable’s design team." Ves sighed. "Do you have any suggestions on how to restore their sanity? If I can just adjust their budget, I can allocate a lot more resources to where they are needed, such as strengthening the fragile Inheritor mechs. I’ve estimated that I can strengthen every Inheritor mech by five percent if I halve the Parallax Star’s budget!"
That five percent didn’t sound so much, but the Inheritor light skirmisher was the most prevalent spaceborn mech in the mech roster. A comprehensive strengthening of five percent could mean the difference between a narrow escape or a devastating loss.
"I’m not a miracle worker, boss." She responded with a flat expression. "You’re not the first head designer who’s been cracking their head over this issue. Alloc hasn’t been able to do anything and neither will you. Just face it, the Venerable knows we are desperate and don’t have any other expert pilot to turn to. As long as Venerable O’Callahan can maintain his monopoly on expert-tier mech deterrence, he’ll milk his advantage for all it’s worth."
Ves let out a grunt in frustration. "It’s wasteful! That selfish old man is squandering our resources! The worst thing about it is that the resources are literally going to waste! He’s got so many spare parts that his design team can assemble at least two complete copies of the Parallax Star! The rationale for fabricating all of these different parts is impractical as well! The enemy won’t stop their attacks wait for them to assemble the right configuration of parts."
"Efficiency seems to be one of your pet peeves. You can’t stand it when someone is making suboptimal choices."
"I guess you’re right." He sighed. "I feel incredibly frustrated to see something so wrong be allowed to continue without change. My mind just itches when I think about it. I constantly feel I have to do something about it. I’d do anything to make it stop!"
Normally, Ves was never a stickler for perfect efficiency. He fostered a slow and meticulous work culture at the LMC’s Mech Nursery. He could have opted for more speed in order to increase their efficiency, but he wanted to maintain the best possible quality.
Too much efficiency wasn’t always a good thing. The production methods he witnessed at Vaun Industrial pursued an extreme of efficiency that was endemic to large, well-run mech manufacturers.
There wasn’t anything wrong with their pursuit, as it obviously allowed them to mass produce the largest amount of mechs at the lowest cost possible at very high speeds. These all sounded like ideal qualities to an industrialists who pursuit the maximum amount of profit.
A consummate craftsman like Ves couldn’t accept the pursuit of profit above all else. A mech was a wonderful machine and deserved some consideration. It took time and effort to build a quality product, and a naked pursuit for efficiency neglected many subtle and indefinable attributes that separated a masterpiece from a mass produced commodity.
In this paradigm, expert mechs always measured at the other end of the extreme. Each and every expert mech was a highly customized machine designed to interface with only one unique customer. It was a mech that was designed, fabricated, modified and maintained for the use of one expert pilot.
It wasn’t worth it to go through all of that trouble for a single regular mech pilot. It only became cost-effective to do so for expert pilots because their amazing capabilities more than made up for the investment.
The only problem here was that O’Callahan is pushing it way past common sense. The Parallax Star didn’t get any stronger. At most, it had a few more tools at its disposal, but it would take too much time to swap the parts.
"I hate to say it to you, boss, but you’re going to have to deal with it." Iris said when she saw that Ves was still struggling to come up with a solution. "The multiverse isn’t perfect. You don’t always get what you want, and perfection is never easy to obtain. Maintaining the status quo is the least-bad option. Every other option would weaken the task for or see you fired."
She was right. Ves didn’t want to admit it. He felt he should have been clever enough to come up with a golden solution that would have addressed the problem without making things worse.
In the end, he shrugged. "I don’t have any options right now. I’ll leave the issue be, but I’ll definitely return on it once the situation changes."
Ves proceeded to distract himself by throwing himself to the complicated task of planning out the task force’s mech composition. He already had a good idea what he wanted to adjust.
The scarcity of certain critical resources limited much of his options. Though the Vandals looted a huge amount of valuable exotics and other materials from the Detemen System, they prioritized exotics known with a high volume to price ratio. Most of these materials weren’t suitable to be the main ingredients to repair or enhance their existing stock of mechs.
If Ves planned his mech composition around the meager strategic stockpiles in the cargo holds, he found out that the task force would quickly run dry within a week.
He remembered that the Vandals arrived in the Detemen System with largely empty cargo holds in order to carry away as much loot as possible. This didn’t leave much room for critical supplies that could keep the Vandals going.
The task force would never be able to reach the Reinald Republic without obtaining more supplies.
"Iris, please schedule a meeting with Lieutenant Commander Soapstone. I’m going to need her help and advice. Make it a longer appointment if possible."
"On it, boss."
A few minutes later, she confirmed the appointment. "You can meet with her after the fleet jumps back into FTL. Right now, she’s busy with allocating the resources we’ve mined from this system’s asteroid belt."
"Understood."
The Vandals couldn’t do anything outside their ship as long as they travelled through FTL. Thus, the fleet cherished any moment they popped out of the higher dimensions in order to cycle down their FTL drives and mine some extra resources from the local star system.
"We won’t always get lucky and emerge in an empty or rebel-controlled star system." He whispered. "Iris, do you know how many transitions we have to go through before we’re out of Imodris?"
"One or two more jumps, no more." She said. Since she was also a representative of the VRF, she knew a little more about Major Verle’s intentions. "I think we’ll only do a larger jump rather than two smaller ones because Major Verle really wants to shake off any pursuers from Imodris. They’re mad as hell."
"Alright."
A larger jump enabled them to cover more distance, but made it easier for the enemies to track and anticipate their destination. It was a decision that traded security for speed.
"Hopefully we won’t get caught by Imodris at our next destination."
Ves emerged from Soapstone’s office with a tired but energetic look. In the last three hours, he finally got to meet with Lieutenant Commander Soapstone who apprised him of their logistical situation.
The entire discussion ran on for hours as Soapstone patiently educating him about her own challenges. Most of it was boring and tedious, but Ves forced himself to memorize the points she raised.
In any case, Ves received the answers that he wanted to hear. With Major Verle’s approval, she arranged numerous trades with the regional rebel groups that haunted the Venidse, Klein and Hafner duchies.
"Venidse’s rebel movement is able to channel most of the resources that you need to us. Mind you, we aren’t acquainted with this particular group, and they know that they’re our only effective supplier. This means they’ll certainly try to take advantage by charging triple of what they’re selling while paying a fraction of the valuables we’ve obtained from the Detemen System."
Ves sensed her unspoken message. "So you want to keep the trade as small as possible?"
Soapstone nodded. "Our profits from the Detemen venture will evaporate if we try to fulfill every item on your wishlist. It’s simply not economical for us to fulfill your ambitious plans."
He quietly cursed at that. Couldn’t these rebels recognize that the Vandals could be their allies? Ves was forced to set his sights lower and acquire the bare minimum of what was necessary to keep all of the piloted mechs in fighting shape. He couldn’t spare any extra attention to the spares.
Even then, his means fell short of being able to bring every mech to a functional condition. The attrition some of the Vandal mechs endured on Detemen IV needed an extensive overhaul.
As a result, the task force needed to get past the Imodris and Venidse territories while slightly understrength. "Fortunately, our spaceborn mechs haven’t suffered too much damage compared to our landbound machines."
Yet that didn’t mean the landbound mechs would be mothballed. Venidse was relatively rich in resources and many of its star systems contained valuable mines. Soapstone quietly revealed to Ves that Major Verle and his staff was considering the possibility to raid one of Venidse’s prosperous star systems to supplement their deficient resource outlook.
Soapstone explained the rationale to him. "The rebels charge so much because they’re short on resources and need the money as much as we do. Rather than let them rip us off, it’s better for us if we can cut out the middleman and go for the source."
Ves almost had a heart attack when he heard this notion. "Many of our landbound mechs aren’t up for a planetary raid!"
"Tough luck then, head designer. Major Verle doesn’t want to hear it. We Vandals have endured worse situations. If our mech pilots have to pilot damaged mechs, then so be it. We really need those resources."
Soapstone also hinted that they would perform more raids along the way, because every rebel group was simply demanding too much. The Flagrant Vandals already paid a substantial amount of money to facilitate their passage through hostile space.
"Can you tell me about any large-scale deployments in the works? It would help me out if I know what I can expect in the future."
"There are two important missions that we will likely accept in exchange for obtaining extra assistance from the regional rebel groups. The first one consists of destroying an important defensive installation in the Klein Duchy. The second one entails freeing important prisoners from a jail in the Hafner Duchy."
Both of them sounded like it would require the Vandals to put in their best effort, especially the first mission. Attacking a defensive fortification head-on was not a light matter, and the more mechs on the field, the better.
Ves groaned yet again. "This is really too much. You’re running the Vandals ragged at this rate. I’m sure your mech pilots are able to tough it out, but mechs are exceedingly complex machines. It’s easy to see them as invincible machines of war, but their impervious performance is only possible due to the incredible amount of work being done behind the scenes."
"I’m aware of that." Soapstone retorted, reminding Ves that she excelled in logistics, which most mech officers plainly never thought about. "Yet we are also under a lot of pressure. We made it out of the Detemen System with a lot of riches, but until we are able to reach a friendly or neutral trading system and sell them off at acceptable prices, we won’t be able to derive any benefits from our loot at all. Our current resource-rich state is an illusion. All of our wealth is locked away in hard-to-dispose, illiquid goods."
He understood then that the task force was in a much worse state than he initially believed. It was as if a group of robbers infiltrated a mansion in the middle of a city and stole some precious jewels. Now, the entire city turned hostile against the robbers, leaving them nowhere to sell their ill-gotten gains.
Only by escaping the city and reaching a neighboring one would the heat die down. By then, they could calmly enter any store to sell the jewels at fairer prices.
"So there’s at least three different landbound deployments in the horizon. A raid in Venidse, a mission in Klein and another one in Hafner, is that all?"
"That should be all. We’re reluctant to plan for more because every deployment slows us down. We still need to reach the Reinald Republic within less than two months."
Thank the heavens for that. Ves quietly sighed in relief since they at least remembered that they needed to adhere to a deadline. Otherwise the sheer amount of deployments would have turned him crazy already.
The rest of the discussion mainly revolved around the details and finer points. At first, it didn’t seem to Ves that any of it mattered, but he slowly realized that it was important for him to know some crucial details.
The information he received encompassed tidbits such as what kind of resources Venidse extracted from their mines to where they would be able to obtain medium-density mech-grade fuel.
With his expanded Intelligence, Ves easily memorized all of these important details. If Lieutenant Commander Soapstone found it important enough to mention it to him, then it was worthwhile for him to memorize it all. Some of this information may come handy in the future.
With a bucket load of information stuffed in his head, Ves returned to his office and reworked his own planning according to the new information. He had to get over the fact that his plan left no options but to deploy mechs that still needed some repairs.
The main issue he faced was that it took too much resources to repair all of their landbound mechs. Through some possibles trades in the following three territories, the task force might be able to supplement their most critical needs, but this was just a metaphorical drop in the ocean compared to the actual problem.
Making this planning taxed his mental capacities to the limit. In truth, Ves should have involved some capable assistants to share the load, but besides Iris, Ves could only turn to his supposed deputies.
Thinking about trust the likes of Mercator and Trozin with this responsibility made him feel ill at ease. "They’re not trustworthy enough, and much of this information is sensitive."
Ves was resigned to work at it by himself. As the planning came together, he felt as if his head started to overheat. He needed to lay down his work.
He turned off his terminal and looked around and noticed that Iris was already gone.
"The shift is already over?"
The clock that displayed the standard time revealed that it was midnight right now. Ves stretched his limbs and eased his mind onto other matters.
"I wonder how the LMC is doing?"
As head researcher, Ves had limited access to the galactic net. Much of his access only allowed him to receive data in a passive manner. He wasn’t allowed to transmit any information except what was necessary to access some of it in the first place. In essence, his access to the galactic net amounted to a read-only limitation.
He browsed some of the articles and tried to look up the winner for the award of Best Mech Design of the Year.
"Damn, I lost!"
His mech design only received an honorable mention from the Bentheim Mech Court. In the segment that his Crystal Lord was competing on, the Senior Mech Designers that made up the Court decided to hand over the award to an admittedly worthy and brilliant striker mech design.
A brief look told Ves that the Crystal Lord didn’t lose unjustly to this striker mech. He couldn’t fault the Bentheim Mech Court for being biased. "The Crystal Lord is a good design, but it has its limitations."
He read up on how the LMC was doing, but the public news reports only mentioned what they perceived from the surface. For example, they could tell that the Mech Nursery ramped up their production, but they couldn’t determine how many production lines had been added to the underground manufacturing complex.
One interesting development was that the Crystal Lord gained two different categories of clients. First, some of the Bentheim mech regiments ordered dozens of silver-label Crystal Lords on a trial basis. The news portal that reported this rumor claimed that some of the mech regiments wanted to pimp out the mechs piloted by their officers.
Ves had mixed feelings about the idea. "The Crystal Lord isn’t a military-grade mech."
While he was confident his mech could keep up with most other military-developed mechs, the widespread adoption of the Crystal Lord would certainly introduce some difficulties to these mech regiments.
His perspective was wider now. Having access to all of the information at the disposal of a head designer, Ves was keenly aware of the complications that ensued by mixing military-grade mechs with machines meant for a different audience. The Vandals suffered substantially from this problem because much of their mechs consisted of salvaged or stolen Vesian mechs.
The main benefit to military-grade mechs was that they’re designed to work with a common set of standards, parts and measurements, even among different designs. This streamlined the maintenance process and lightened the burden of fielding several different models of mechs.
It was not to the extent of incorporating every separate model in a single product family, but just a handful of commonalities was enough to ease a mech regiment’s logistical concerns.
As for the Crystal Lord, not only did it make use of fairly unique components derived from Coalition licenses, its laser rifle and chest crystal could only be produced at the Mech Nursery. The silver and gold label mechs distinguished themselves from the bronze-label version fabricated by third party manufacturers by carrying activated alien crystals.
As far as Ves was aware of, there was only one crystal cube in existence that could activate the synthesized crystals.
"This is going to be a problem for the LMC. I hope Calsie won’t be stupid enough to give up the crystal cube."
Besides closing some deals with the Mech Corps, the Crystal Lord also proved to be a surprising hit in the Ylvain Protectorate. They even loosened up their harsh import restrictions to obtain more copies of his premium rifleman mech.
Though he was a little confused why the Ylvains adored the Crystal Lord model all of a sudden, he wasn’t about to turn away a customer.
Ves looked up some other news about home, but only for an hour or so. He couldn’t let himself be consumed by thoughts at home, not while the Vandals still needed to fight their way out of Vesian space.
He initially thought it would be a difficult but manageable ordeal to leave the Kingdom. Now that he became responsible for the task force’s mechs, he realized what an uphill battle he faced.
"Heh. It’s more of a cliff than a hill. Try climbing that."
He finished it . While it took some time, he completed an entire plan for the task force's mech roster that took every major factor into account .
He took into account the skills and capabilities of every mech company, the inclinations of their commanding officers, the available resources that logistics agreed to release for repair work, the likely opposition they faced at various points of time and a projection of what kind of resources they would be able to obtain .
The latter two variables introduced an incredible amount of complexity to his work . Ves had been forced to make assumptions and use his own judgement to fill in the gaps . His increasingly more intricate plan became more flexible as Ves added options in case his assumptions turned out to be wrong .
The dynamic planning took up a lot of time to read and understand, but the basic point of it was to deploy the best possible Vandals mechs at any time within their limitations . Ves minimized as much intervals as possible where they could be caught with their pants down, for example by transitioning hundreds of mechs from one configuration to another . Most of the mass overhauls could take place within the safety of FTL travel .
Ves smiled as he deactivated the privacy screen around his desk and leaned back on his chair . The work was demanding, and he frequently felt as if his brain overheated, but once he finished his work, he experienced a rare moment of fulfillment .
"Did you finish it, boss?"
"I did! It's too bad I'm not allowed to show it off to you . It would be fatal for us if this plan gets leaked out . "
He meticulously cleaned up his terminal of any traces of his work . Fortunately, the Vandals like every mech regiment of the Mech Corps utilized highly-developed routines that did most of the heavy lifting .
Once he ported his data over to a secure data chip, he stood up and left his office, and navigated the Shield of Hispania until he reached Major Verle's door .
After a brief security check and wait, the major commanded him to enter his stateroom . Ves took a seat behind the desk and passed over the data chip .
"Took you long enough, Mr . Larkinson . " The Major grunted as he immediately inserted the chip into his terminal .
"I had to do all of the planning alone . I don't quite trust my subordinates to keep their mouths shut . "
"That's not a good sign . Even if you're the head designer and the best of the bunch, you need to get a grip on your direct subordinates . The point of a hierarchy is to distribute the workload . You can't do that if you don't trust your own underlings . "
Ves shrugged at that . It wasn't as if he could tell Verle that he wouldn't be able to command Mercator and Trozin's loyalty unless he became a Journeyman . Mech designers of their level acquired an innate arrogance that became hard to tame unless they faced a higher-ranking mech designers .
Even if Ves displayed more ability than them, he couldn't suppress them by virtue of that alone . While most Apprentice Mech Designers could never match his extensive knowledge and skills, they still subconsciously thought they were on the same level .
He waited quietly while Major Verle perused the expansive plan . While Ves provided summaries, it took at least half an hour of reading to get the gist of his decisions .
"I see you've provided three different options for me . " Verle said and looked up from his terminal . "What are the differences?"
"They differ mainly depending on which kind of mechs you want to retain when we reach the Hafner Duchy . I anticipate we'll need to be at our strongest at that point, sir . "
Verle nodded in agreement . "Venidse and Hafner will be our toughest opponents . The former because it will be difficult to disentangle ourselves from their forces and the latter because they're good at sniffing us out . "
The older man palmed his stubby chin after mentioning those two powers . The Vandal commander did not relish facing both of them in battle, but their current circumstances compelled them into a possible collision course .
Ves proceeded to spend the next hour guiding Major Verle through a broad outline of his plan .
"Right now, we're on our way out of Imodris and still have to carry out essential repairs..."
"When we reach Venidse, I've heard there will be a possible raid on the horizon . My men will direct the mech technicians to make some essential repairs on these landbound mechs..."
"I don't project we'll face a lot of challenges in the Klein Duchy, but their long-ranged firepower focus can be devastating if they wish to harass us . We're going to have to lean on the Inheritor mechs to teach them a lesson..."
"I don't think we can avoid a pitched battle against Hafner . They'll track us down and force us into battle eventually, so I've planned for the worst . We'll to bring up the heavy stuff and modify our spaceborn mechs to withstand their initial charge..."
Ves justified each of his decisions with evidence, and if he lacked enough backing from that, he supplemented it with reasonable assumptions . The plan also possessed a lot of branches that provided alternatives to Major Verle . The three major options that Major Verle took note of could be described as three different flavors that put more emphasis on a particular strategy .
Personally, Ves favored the option that elevated the Inheritor light skirmishers into their mainstay mechs . He always felt a bias for this poor underdog of a mech model and wished that the Vandals took them seriously for once . Out of all of their spaceborn mechs, the Inheritor was one of their most prevalent model . It was well worth investing them in his eyes .
Sadly, Major Verle had other ideas . "I like this option . The Hellcat hybrid knights provides me with the most tactical flexibility . They're excellent whether they are spread out among the mech companies or gathered into specialized squads . "
"Sir, I think you should take a serious look at the Inheritor option . It's our most numerous mech, after all, and their speed is their best asset . "
"They are useful, but they only serve a narrow role . " Verle shook his head . "Their biggest demerit is that they do not excel at defense and that they're countered by Hafner's mech doctrine . There is no little use in trying to maintain their strength for the final stretch . It is better to use them up beforehand . "
And with those heartless words, his suggestion died a silent grave . Ves bowed his head in apology for the Inheritor mech pilots that would soon be running the gauntlet . There was no way they'd be able to take it easy .
"There are a number of points that seem dubious to me . I'd like you to change some of these aspects . "
Major Verle provided a small number of key changes . Most of it concerned the modifications that Ves suggested to be made in order to gear the mechs against specific opponents . For example, to counter against Venidse stealth attacks, he planned to turn the Inheritor mechs into mobile sentries that meticulously scanned their vicinity for any anomalies with upgraded sensors .
"This upgrade is too demanding in terms of resources . Instead of incorporating the sensor upgrades on half of the Inheritors, it's sufficient if only twenty percent of our complement carry this sensor system . We should have just enough Inheritors to provide full spherical coverage around our fleet . "
"That will be cutting it close, sir . The coverage wouldn't have as much depth . It's easier for Venidse to sneak their stealth mechs past our patrols if we only put up a single detection layer around our ships . "
"We won't be relying solely on the Inheritors to do their jobs . Don't forget our combat carriers . They can provide us with a second detection layer . "
"By the time the combat carriers detect something wrong, it's already too late, sir . "
Ves had a good point, but Major Verle wanted to allocate more resources elsewhere . Since the major was in command, Ves had no choice but to yield and adjust his plans .
They talked over other many issues, and while Ves had to change many details, he was able to convince the major to stick to the plan . Overall, they refined the plan in a way that made more sense to a true Vandal . Ves had only stuck to them for less than half a year . It was natural that his knowledge of the Vandal fighting style contained a lot of holes .
"I'm satisfied with the work you've done, Mr . Larkinson . I'll provisionally approve of this plan for now so we can start pouring our resources where they are necessary . I want you to attend the next meeting that I'm holding with my staff so that we can benefit from their input . "
"I'll be there, sir . "
Ves was satisfied that Major Verle largely accepted his plan . His hard work hadn't gone to waste, and the mech officer didn't fault too many of his assumptions . Ves felt as if he made a genuine contribution to the survival of the task force .
Major Verle kicked Ves out of his wardroom shortly after . The meeting ate up a lot of their time, and they needed to fulfill their other obligations . Ves neglected many of his other responsibilities while he became consumed with planning out their mech roster .
"Planning our mech roster is a head designer's most important responsibility, but that doesn't mean I can sit back and relax once I've finished planning . "
His second major responsibility as a head designer was to lead the other mech designers and make sure they weren't up to no good . Even if mech designers were smart, it wasn't a good idea to loosen their reins .
He paused to consider his most pressing issue . Major Verle already issued a warning to him, and he didn't intend to neglect it any longer .
"I have no way to command my subordinates except to invoke my official authority . While it works in a pinch, it won't work in the longer term . I've got to work on cultivating some trustworthy subordinates . "
Ves cast his eyes to the future when he made this decision . Even after the task force completed their mission, Iris was right in that the Vandals might appoint Ves to another leadership position in the future . The Vandals were awfully short-handed and they didn't have enough Senior and Journeyman Mech Designers to supervise every important project .
While Ves didn't necessary dream of a career within the Vandals . If possible, he didn't wish to clash against other careerist mech designers who wanted to climb up the ladder like Mercator . Yet their relative lack of competence compelled Ves to compete against them, if only so that he would be spared from following the orders of someone who didn't know what he was doing .
"At the heart of it, the only reason why the mech designers attached to the Vandals are in such an awful shape is because there aren't enough of us!"
It wasn't too hard for the Flagrant Vandals to recruit low-ranking mech designers through their own recruiting channels . Yet these people didn't really bring too much to the table . In order to obtain mech designers with several successes to their name, the Vandals needed to rely on the generosity of the Mech Corps .
"Heh, even if we've pulled off a daring raid in the Detemen System, I don't think they'll change their mind . "
Many other Vandals expressed the same cynical sentiment . Their disdain for the Republic and the Mech Corps made it hard for them to hope for a helping hand .
In other words, Ves needed to work with the mech designers they already had . No matter if they were conscripted like Ves or volunteered like Mercator, both of these types possessed their own competencies .
Still, thinking about their low numbers, Ves thought back on his observation that all of the Apprentice Mech Designers had only entered into the mech regiment's service for less than five years . Except for the Journeymen and Professor Velten, every other mech designer transferred away for one reason or another .
When Ves returned to his office, he turned on his terminal and entered the personnel files . Ves used his head designer privileges to investigate the reason for the transfers, but it turned out that this matter was not as simple as he thought .
"Insufficient clearance? What? I'm the head designer!"
This obstacle reminded him that he only scratched the surface of the Flagrant Vandals . Ves always felt as if something ominous hid behind their simplistic nature .
Ves scheduled another comprehensive meeting . Every mech designer in the task force had been ordered to attend it, though it was sufficient for them to show up as projections . They could hardly enter a shuttle and transfer over to the Shield of Hispania while the entire task force entered FTL .
In the meantime, Ves fulfilled some of his other responsibilities . He paid a visit to each of the Shield of Hispania's hangar bays to provide consultations for the resident mech pilots and mech technicians .
He spent days drawing upon the full potential of his formidable mind to fill out an expansive but fairly abstract plan . Staring at the developing mech roster all day disconnected him from the mechs and people that the numbers represented . Ves couldn't let himself become too detached to reality .
"Mr . Larkinson, can you teach us how to increase this laser rifle's heat capacity?"
"I don't understand why this mech glitches out whenever its power reactor reaches twenty-seven percent capacity! We've been thinking about replacing it with another one, but it's too costly if we proceed with this solution!"
"I heard you've got a good touch for mechs! Every mech you laid your hands on feels great for every mech pilot! Can you bless our mechs as well?"
The low-level problems didn't require much effort for Ves to address . He found it relaxing in a way to forget about his heaviest responsibilities and return to basics . Ves always believed that the best mech designer needed to rely on both theory and practice to advance their understanding of the craft .
"Knowledge advances our technical understanding of mechs, but practice allows us to develop our artistic side . "
Not every mech designer agreed that their profession incorporated art or craftsmanship . This was different from other design professions such as architects who constantly try to influence the people that inhabited the structures they designed .
Ves found it kind of sad that most of the mech designers he had met among the Vandals ascribed to a different school of thought . They leaned more towards a functional or utilitarian perspective of mechs .
This viewpoint expressly rejected any subjective attachments to mechs and only cared about their objective performance . The spec sheets were holy and the numbers never lied .
Having corresponded with the likes of Iris, Pierce and Laida, Ves understood that this was common among the mech designers who worked as grunts in design teams .
"They don't have the power to exert any influence on the designs they are working on . They are only there to perform some menial tasks . "
Only the highest-ranked mech designers that led the design teams had a use for their artistic side .
"The high-ranking mech designers among us don't just need to reach the rank of Apprentice, they also have to develop their first original design by themselves . How did they even manage to accomplish this?"
Independent mech designers like Ves who founded their own businesses turned out to be very rare . While Ves himself knew that most mech designers shied away from the risks and the high barriers to entry associated with going it alone, too many mech designers opted to go for the easy road .
While these mech designers pursued honest careers, their overspecialization atrophied their ability to design a complete mech by themselves .
"A mech designer who specializes in legs won't know what to do when they have to design the other portions of a mech . "
At the very least, there would be a noticeable imbalance of quality . Yet even then, mech designers like Mercator and Iris somehow made the cut . How did they do it?
Ves checked the MTA's expansive archives and looked up their first original designs . He quickly found out that they used the same strategy they employed during the design duel .
"They ripped off another design . "
Truly, the definition of what constituted an 'original' design was hard to pin down . If Ves copied the Caesar Augustus but coated it black instead of white, then nobody would accept he designed an original mech . Yet if he attempted to design a vague copy of the Caesar Augustus while making use of different component licenses, then he arguably designed an 'original' mech .
Even if the imitation possessed highly similar specs to the original, it still constituted an original design to the MTA . Their exact criteria on the matter was a secret . Suffice to say, the actual hurdle wasn't very high to most mech designers .
"Did I make too much of a fuss when I debuted my own work to the public?"
No . A proper first original design attracted a fair amount of publicity . Ves followed the tradition sincerely and got rewarded for it with plenty of coverage that boosted the marketing for his Blackbeak design .
As for the poor imitations and ripoffs designed by his colleagues within the mech regiment? The MTA may have validated their designs, but their only practical use was to collect dust in the archives . No one spared a glance at their so-called debut works, and this lack of distinction would certainly become a hindrance to their careers if they tried to make something of themselves in the private sector .
"They may be able to get past the MTA, but they can't fool the market . "
Time passed until the time for the meeting began . Ves sat himself at the front of the conference room . The seats had been constrained in concentric circles this time to foster a sense of equality . The main reason why he called for this meeting was to address the concerns of lower-ranking mech designers who did most of the actual grunt work in the fleet .
Emitters flared up as lifelike projections of people appeared inside the conference room . They quietly took their places and wondered why he scheduled this meeting .
Familiar faces such as Pierce, Mercator and Trozin sat in the inner circle . Numerous amounts of lower-ranked mech designers sat in the outer circles . Ves focused his gaze on each and every one of them . Some met his stares, others instantly bent their heads or shield away .
This was what he expected, and frankly hoped for . Ves placed much stock on these Novice and fairly junior Apprentice Mech designers that revered him . In his eyes, they were like loose clay, ready for him to be shaped in any form he wanted .
As for the higher-ranked Apprentices, none of them really looked at him with reverence . Oh, they respected his skills and acknowledged his prowess, but they never thought he was better than them . Only Pierce feared him a little bit because he witnessed what Ves was fully capable of during their boot camp .
Iris didn't fear him at all, but Ves already had a good rapport with her . As the only physical mech designer present, she stood out from the other occupants as her body appeared just a bit more real than others . Despite the excellent quality of projectors, human eyes were much more capable in certain aspects than machines .
When everyone's virtual avatars arrived, Ves stood up and began the meeting . "Thank you for coming here today . We've got a number of points on the agenda to go through . First, let me announce to you that a provisional plan for our mech roster has received Major Verle's approval . I don't expect any major changes to the plan, so it is essentially a done project . "
"Can we obtain copies of the plan, sir? It's hard to work while blind! I don't know if I need to enhance a mech's speed or armor for the next deployment . "
Ves shook his head . "I'm afraid I can't do that . A lot of sensitive information can be derived from the full plan . Even the summaries are enough to plunge the Vandals into a crisis if someone leaks them out to the Vesians . For now, I'll only release information to you on a need to know basis . "
Mercator raised his hand . "Head designer, as your deputies, it would be helpful for us to be acquainted with your plan . Will you allow us access to some of the details? We only need enough to make some preparations . "
"As I've stated before, you'll be informed when you need to know at that point in time . " Ves glibbed while trying to keep his smile hidden .
He really didn't like Mercator, but he thought it would be unprofessional to show his displeasure at his own deputy . He wouldn't give Mercator or any snake the satisfaction to see him make a blunder . In any case, words were cheap, and Ves felt no guilt in answering with a lie or non-answer .
In any case, Ves could tell that Mercator hadn't been taken in by the nonsense, but wisely refrained from making a fuss .
"Mr . Larkinson, if nobody gets to access the details beforehand, will all of us be working blind?" Trozin asked her own question .
"I'll essentially drip-feed your assignments when they need to be done . It's not ideal, but it minimizes the damage should any of this leaks out . I don't want to hand over our entire itenary for the next two months to the Vesians .
Everyone chuckled at that, though the prospect wasn't all that funny .
Ves explained a few more things and even revealed the first step of the plan, which wasn't too complicated . "A possible landbound deployment is in the air, so make sure you divert at least half of your focus on landbound mechs that can be fixed with ease . Prioritize the easy cases first and leave the heavily damaged mechs for later . "
Some of them looked surprised that they needed to work on the landbound mech . After all, wouldn't a straightforward flight from Vesian space be a straight run to the border? Ves didn't let out anything about the topic after that, but he figured the inquisitive mech designers would figure out the motivations on their own soon enough .
"Now, I'll be demanding that you work as hard as possible for the next two months . We need to maximize our productivity and minimize our waste . Anyone who slacks off or fobs off their assigned to a mech technician or something will be punished harshly!"
Ves emphasised the importance of hard work because the plan demanded a lot of changes to be made at critical intervals in the next two months .
Perhaps someone foresaw the sheer amount of work Ves would soon pile up on their shoulders . "Sir, we aren't bots who can't work all day! We need our rest moments!"
"Tough luck, then . We're at war, and we're knee-deep in enemy territory . Relax when you sleep . Otherwise, go to work . The more we get things done, the stronger the Vandals become . "
More people started to furrow their brows . They faintly suspected that Ves would start to become their slave driver .
Ves grinned and gestured towards Mercator and Trozin . "My deputies will keep an eye on your productivity . If you haven't been meeting your targets, they'll be sure to whip you back into shape!"
The two deputies looked surprised at Ves for giving them this duty . However, it made sense for them to be their supervisors because that was what deputies should do . In any case, Ves wouldn't have to bother with the tedium while the other mech designers became a little more guarded in front of the deputies .
Naturally, since Ves showed off his stick, he should also introduce the carrot . "I don't expect you to work for nothing . Anyone who meets their targets for the week will receive the right to borrow one Journeyman-level textbook from the central database of the Mech Corps . It'll be yours to peruse for an entire month!"
That lit a fire under their butts . No mech designer wanted to stay stagnant, and for most of them, a quality Journeyman-level textbook from the Mech Corps was a highly sought-after commodity!
"That's not all! Those who exceed their targets by a fair margin will receive greater privileges . Those who are eligible can either exchange it for the right to borrow another textbook for half a year, or the opportunity to receive my personal tutelage for an entire hour!"
That caused the mech designers to really take notice . Textbooks weren't easy to digest, and the mech designers also needed to fulfill their other duties before they had time to study new knowledge . Being allowed to borrow a textbook for half a year would be enough for them to understand at least ninety-five of its contents!
As for an hour's worth of personal tutoring from Ves, this potential reward turned out to be very polarizing!
Ves lacked many advantages that could shore up his position .
First, he wasn't a genuine Journeyman, so he wouldn't be able to command respect by virtue of his status . Even if he had the biggest fist at the moment, many mech designers subconsciously believed that this would be a temporary state .
It was much like how older advanced mech pilots all considered themselves as equals in skill . They all ran into the bottleneck that barred their way towards metamorphosing into an expert pilot . Even if they excelled in different skills, all of them were the same in the eyes of an expert pilot .
Second, Ves was an outsider . He didn't know anyone from before the Mech Corps drafted him and even his fellow alumni from the Rittersberg University of Technology didn't know him . To be honest, back then he was so mediocre that no one bothered to pay attention to him . He wasn't like Patricia Schneider, who stood out as a genius out of place from the start .
Bandying out his connection to Master Olson didn't help much either . It explained his superiority to them, but rather acknowledging his accomplishment of gaining a Master's attention, they envied him instead . Jealousy was a powerful human emotion that motivated countless people to irrational decisions .
Third, their current conditions made it hard to form any bond . With the fleet moving through FTL for most of its two-month journey, every mech designer needed to interact with each other through comms and projections . Though virtual technology made it easy to connect to each other, it was no substitute to being physically present in the same room .
Besides, with the work schedules that Ves planned to hand out week by week, everyone would be too busy to socialize . Those who reached their work targets faster than scheduled might squeeze some moments together, but those would be few and far in between .
He thought back on his resolve to leverage what he possessed in order to get what he wanted . If he could leverage his unique talents in mech design to trade for the assistance of a biomedical institution to figure out his body, then why not use those same talents to achieve other goals?
Mech design was the only thing he was good at, and for a long time Ves thought himself as an ant among giants . With the existence of higher-ranked mech designers such as Journeymen, Seniors, Masters and Star Designers, Ves truly felt as if he had been playing with the sand .
Even if he had the fortuitous assistance of the Mech Designer System, the device only let him catch up a little faster .
It was only recently that his opinion of himself had undergone a shift . Interacting with so many different mech designers during his tour with the Flagrant Vandals allowed him to understand his place .
"I am more than an Apprentice but less than a Journeyman . "
He wasn't close to advancing . He could feel that deep within his bones . Yet he happened to be closer to the threshold than anyone else in the Verle Task Force, so Ves happened to possess the most qualifications to be a teacher .
What did other mech designers desire the most? They shared the same dream as Ves . They wanted to reach past their limitations and progress their ability to design mechs until they reached the pinnacle in their profession .
To do that, they needed to learn and improve . Studying textbooks was one way they would be able to absorb new knowledge, but having someone more knowledgeable teaching them the essence of what they missed was of incredible value .
Ves liked to think he would make for a great teacher . After all, his unorthodox learning process through the System crammed him with an extensive understanding of several fields . It lacked the holes, biases, misunderstandings and outdated theories that everyone else had to struggle with as they read their way through stuffy textbooks .
As Ves announced the option to choose for an hour's worth of tutoring from him, most of the higher-ranked mech designers adopted a disdainful look . What he achieved, they could achieve as well . That was what they believed in their hearts .
Only a couple of people that knew him better possessed an inkling of its value . If they could let go of their pride, they definitely stood to benefit a lot .
As for the lower-ranked mech designers, they didn't have much pride to begin with . In front of their colleagues who achieved substantial success, their self-worth had long been ground to dust . As far as the Vandals were concerned, these bunch of failures never got off the starting line .
They weren't 'real' mech designers, not like Ves or Pierce or even the likes of Mercator .
Yet because they never got a proper start, they desired what their more successful peers achieved more than anything else . Ves could see the hunger in the expressions of their projections . Some hid it better than others, but almost every mech designer sitting in the back seats felt their long-dormant hope beginning to ignite .
Ves smirked inwardly at that . He successfully planted the seeds within their minds . Time would tell whether they germinated .
The rest of the meeting didn't contain any more bombshells . He handed out schedules of the work that needed to be done in the next few days . He tasked Mercator and Trozin to keep track of every mech designer's progress on top of their current duties . Ves didn't care if it ate away at their time .
He threw out one more warning before he ended the meeting .
"Be careful when the task force arrives at our next destination . It's our last stop before we leave the Imodris Duchy, so it is the only star system where our pursuers have a hope of stopping us . Everyone will be called to battle stations anyway, but I hope you realize there is a chance we'll be plunged into combat as soon as our ships emerge from FTL . "
Some of them shrugged them off, inured to their positions as non-combatants who wouldn't be exposed to much danger . What happened to Ves and Alloc was an exception . Maybe a few of them would take his warning seriously, but Ves didn't bet on it . In any case, he performed his due diligence .
The projections winked out at the end of the meeting . No doubt everyone hurried to study the work schedule that Ves just sent to their comms .
Over the next days, every mech designer settled into a new routine . Some still worked on spaceborn mechs while others started piecing together landbound mechs . Through various indicators that directly fed into his terminal, Ves kept a good gauge on everyone's progress .
Compared to past performance, at least half of the lower-ranked mech designers achieved more results . They acted like they had a fire lit under their butts and obviously attempted to exceed their weekly quotas .
When Ves showed the changes to Iris, she whistled in appreciation . "Your little offer works better than I thought, boss! I never realized how desperate these Novices are . Just an hour's worth of tutoring is enough to increase their productivity by a third!"
Perhaps not everyone would be able to maintain this level of hyperactive work, but that was good for Ves as well . He didn't relish staying stuck in his office tutoring over a dozen individual students .
"Not all of them are aiming for a tutoring session . " Ves added . "Some value the privilege of being able to borrow a textbook for half a year . Personally, I would go for this first before opting to receive a tutoring session, as the tutor can help me understand the contents of the book . "
A tutor only helped when the student already progressed their studies to a good extent . Only a full-blown teaching course would be able to help them understand a complete field from scratch .
As much as Ves was willing to be a teacher for a period of time, he didn't have the time to spare on such distractions . Maybe once the war came at an end, Ves would reconsider the matter .
In fact, the idea appealed to him in a way . Though Ves was never one for lofty thoughts such as feeling the obligation to contribute to the growth of the next generation, he at least felt some understanding for other mech designers that decided to take up a teaching position .
"I don't think you've offered to teach them out of a whim . What are you getting out of it, if I may ask?"
"Teaching is a good way to get in touch with some good seeds . " Ves responded . "If work at it hard enough, I can begin to build my own network . "
Even Professor Velten used to teach at an institution in the Republic before she worked for the Flagrant Vandals . The MTA provided incentives to anyone that took up a teaching position, but even without that carrot mech designers still sought to pass on some of their knowledge .
Now that he reached a height where he could tentatively call himself a qualified teacher, Ves already started scheming on what kind of advantages he could get out of this side activity .
"Ah, so you're aiming to build your own influence among the Vandals . " Iris nodded .
"To be honest, forging some relationships during my stay with the Vandals is a bonus . A friend who is just a Novice Mech Designer isn't very useful to me . What I'm really trying to do is to reel in some promising seeds and invite them to join my ventures after the war . "
Iris looked at his with widened eyes . "That's really far-sighted of you, sir . This is an excellent idea! Comrades who've gone through thick and thin during a war share the most lasting bonds . "
Ves thought back about his uncles and aunts who told him stories when he was young . Those veterans often spoke fondly of their unbreakable connection with their comrades in arms . Some even visited them regularly to catch up on old times .
If the Mech Corps hadn't dragged him into the war, Ves would have resorted to cultivating relationships through teaching sooner or later . It was a good means to get in touch with promising mech designers that deserved some investment .
Naturally, there was always the possibility that Ves would pull out a gem from the rough, however minute this possibility actually turned out to be . If he taught someone half as smart as Oleg, he would quickly have a capable assistant at his beck and call .
Still, there were risks involved with teaching as well . Some might abuse his trust or aim to steal his secrets . If someone knew about any of his major secrets such as the existence of the System or his one attempt at breaking the taboo against weapons of mass destruction, Ves would instantly be hunted down by the most powerful organizations in the galaxy .
Others might turn out to be so talented that they might quickly surpass Ves . Before, they lacked the opportunity to show of their excellence . Poverty, lack of connections or just being a late bloomer doomed them into lowest echelons of mech designers . Once Ves recognized their talents pulled them up to his level, they would finally be able to spread their wings and show off their brilliance .
Ves didn't fear these occurrences, though he would definitely feel uneasy if any of these occurrences happened to him . That was the extent of it . "If I feel uncomfortable about something, then it's not something to reject . "
He believed he protected his secrets well enough . Also, if some prodigy managed to shoot up and become a Journeyman Mech Designer in record time, then that was nothing shameful . He wasn't petty to the point where he couldn't tolerate someone being better than him in mech design .
"There are already so many Senior and Master Mech Designers in the Komodo Star Sector alone . What is the harm of one more addition?"
Ves believed that with the help of the System, he could definitely become a Master within a century . He set his sights much higher, so it was more important that he laid the best foundation possible than to race up the ranks with no regard to the end run .
He couldn't help but think back on Morgan's theory that Apprentices shouldn't rush to advance to Journeyman . The mech designer that Ves briefly acquainted back at boot camp might possess some very odd ideas, but this one kept lingering in the back of his mind .
The gains and benefits of teaching took time to ferment . Right now, Ves felt like a farmer who just sowed his seeds . He needed to wait at least an entire season for the crops to grow ripe before he harvested the fruits of his labor .
Unexpectedly, an opportunity to practice his teaching came after they wrapped up the meeting . As soon as they returned to their office, Iris came up to his desk .
"Can you teach me?"
Ves blinked at the sudden request . Iris hadn't done anything to merit such a privilege . She had her own work to perform, so asking him to tutor him right now was highly inappropriate .
Still, he was never a stickler for rules . "As long as it doesn't affect your work too much, I'm fine if you want to receive some pointers . "
Iris put her hand on her hips and smirked . "I'm not expecting you to pass on your knowledge for nothing . Don't forget that I have my own strengths as a mech designer . My fundamentals aren't as solid as yours, but when it comes to neural interfaces, I dare say that even Professor Velten can't match the depth of my expertise!"
That was an extremely bold claim to make, and if Ves thought a little more highly of the old woman, he would have reprimanded his assistant .
"You shouldn't say such things out loud . " He responded mildly . "Also, the study of neural interfaces is severely restricted by the MTA . I need to obtain a permit from the Association before I'm allowed immerse myself in this field . "
"That's only important if you actually do something with your newly-gained knowledge, such as designing your own neural interfaces . The MTA will let it slide if I am just 'giving you some pointers' instead of trying to raise you up as a fully-fledged neural interface developer . I'm not allowed to pass on the core teachings of the Jupiter Family anyway . "
Ves mulled the proposition carefully . After committing a heinous war crime behind the MTA's back at the System's behest, his instinctive reverence towards the all-powerful organization had taken a significant hit . The idea of bending some of their rules to his advantage didn't sound as bad .
"Well, if you are sure they won't act, I'm open for an exchange . "
When Ves explained the Skills he was proficient in and revealed some of the extent of his depth in Physics, Iris looked very impressed at him . Somehow, her astonishment pleased him and spurred him on .
"It takes years of study and access to a lot of good textbooks to reach my level . However, I can grant you access to a handful of helpful titles to get you starting on shoring up your fundamentals . "
"That's great! I can't thank you enough! Still, I'll feel guilty if you gift me all of this help . I know I don't deserve it was I am right now . " Iris tapped her delicate chin . "How about this . Let me teach you more than a few pointers about neural interfaces . In fact, if you don't have anything urgent on the agenda, let's start right now!"
Ves recalled his current schedule and knew there was nothing on the agenda for today . "That's fine . I can determine whether it this topic fits with my interests . "
"From the Jupiter Family's perspective, a mech designer who neglects the importance of neural interfaces are stunted in their growth . In the eyes of my elders, the MTA has gone overboard in restricting the study and development of neural interfaces after the infamous Farund Affair . "
"Well, brainwashing through interfacing with your mech is a horrible nightmare that no sane person would wish to another . " Ves pointed out . "The sanctity of the mind is a core value for humanity . When your thoughts have become the property of others, our race will cease to flourish . "
"Hmph . " Iris huffed and waved her hand dismissively . "Neural interface technology can be abused just as much as laser weapon or power reactor technology . In the wrong hands, they can achieve an enormous amount of devastation, but you never hear any reactor developer getting arrested for designing exploding products, do you?"
"Abuse of other technologies are easy to spot and easier to prevent . The damage that neural interfaces do is often invisible and pernicious . The fear of the unknown is often scarier than the planet-cracking superweapons of the past . "
"Well, let's agree to disagree then . " Iris gave up on this argument . To her, Ves had hopelessly been affected by too much MTA propaganda . "The point I was trying to make is that while neural interfaces can do a lot of damage in the wrong hands, the flip side is also true . A well-designed neural interface that is geared towards specific mech pilots can boost their effective performance by the same margin!"
Ves had often heard these kinds of claims, but it sounded fantasy back then . "How is this possible? A mech has a defined level of performance . It's impossible to exceed the parameters of a spec sheet . "
"I'm not talking about breaking the specs . " Iris shook her head . "As a mech designer, do you believe that a mech is constantly pushing its performance to match the upper limit of the specs in the spec sheet?"
Ves paused at that question . Just because a mech exhibited a top speed of a hundred kilometers per hour didn't meant it ran at that speed all the time . Most of the time they would briskly walk to their destination, if only to minimize their energy consumption .
"The spec sheets only define the upper limits of the specs . Mechs don't push that far most of the times . "
"This is the where a good neural interface can make the difference . They smoothen and facilitate the man-machine connection so that the thoughts of a mech pilot will lead to more responsive performance from the mech . This enables the combination to switch between high and low states of their parameters on a whim . The best analogy that my Family came up with would be like comparing a rubble-filled street with a well-paved street . Mechs are able to walk through a cleared street much more easily than a street that suffered the aftermath of a destructive battle . "
"So in other words, thoughts flow faster and more effortlessly with a better neural interface?"
"I wouldn't call it a better neural interface . There are ways you can elevate the absolute quality of an interface, but much of our craft concerns accommodating the unique minds of every mech pilot we've come across . "
"Then are interfaces doomed to be a customized product that's bound to a single mech designer?"
"Not to that extent . Instead, you can say that mech pilots fall into a couple of hundred different types . Do you know that some mech squads from the galactic center are grouped together because they possess the same neural profile? This allows them to pilot any mech in their squads without worrying about incompatibility . "
"Ah, but is it worth it? The mechs we are working with so far are doing fine without any fancy tricks with their neural interface . "
"That's because the MTA-mandated standard models are designed to be as compatible and complication-proof as possible . They're the safest and most limited models, and if you knew what neural interfaces are really capable of, you'll realize how crippled they really are!"
"Well, in exchange for opting with these limited neural interface models, I'll at least benefit from some peace of mind . " Ves retorted . "I don't think any standard neural interface model has ever malfunctioned since the MTA started promoting their use . "
Iris laughed at that . "To me, it sounds as if you are willingly taking the hardest road when there is a much more easier path over to the sides . Neural interfaces that are able to demonstrate the potential of what they could do are highly precious because they enable a mech pilot to modulate the parameters with much less effort . Practically speaking, mech pilots that make use of tailored neural interfaces are able to push their mechs to their upper limits without any strain!"
Now that finally caught his attention . If she was telling the truth, then the risks of catastrophic failure wasn't enough for Ves to abort this plan .
"What's the difference between a standard neural interface and a better one? Besides the advantages that you already mentioned . "
"Hm, the foundation of the control scheme of a mech relies on conveying the thoughts of the mech pilots to their mechs . Do you know how difficult that is? Mech cadets need months to get used to the disparity between controlling their human bodies and operating their mech bodies . A good neural interface is able to shorten this adjustment period until it's nonexistent! This is the difference that good design and access to the best materials could bring to the table . "
"That doesn't entirely answer my question . I get it that better materials allow you to construct a better interface, but what are the factors in the design that provides such a specific improvement . "
Iris smirked at him in an intrigued manner . "What I'm about to say is a little controversial, but here goes . Neural interface developers are able to . . . influence the man-machine connection . There are many dangers involved with this, the Farund Affair being one of the more subtle outcomes, but with careful prodding we're able to push a mech pilot into various patterns of behavior, such as improving their reaction speed or making them more alert to attacks from the rear!"
She was right . This was a massive bombshell to Ves . "Isn't that brainwashing?"
"Every manipulation of the mind is a form of brainwashing . It's a meaningless catch-all term . We'd like to call it influencing . Through our predetermined designs, we're able to influence the set behavior of specific mech pilots into performing actions they normally wouldn't take . Of course, as mech designers we exclusively try to come up with outcomes that will increase the odds of survival . "
"That still doesn't change the fact that you're talking about unwilling manipulation! Do the mech pilots even know that their own neural interface is messing with their minds?"
"We generally abstain from disclosing the truth to regular and advanced mech pilots . Registered neural interface developers like myself received special dispensation from the MTA to withhold the truth . Mech pilots aren't the smartest bunch of people in the galaxy . Telling them the full scope of what our neural interface do will only incite panic and fear . "
"Maybe some of that panic and fear is justified . " Ves retorted . He hadn't completely calmed down from her earlier revelation . "The more I heard about this, the more I'm leaning away towards accepting your teachings . No offense, Iris, but messing with the free will of man and machine deeply abhorrent to me . "
Like hacking mechs, manipulating mech pilots through their neural interface clashed directly against his design philosophy .
Still, despite his reactions, Iris kept smirking at him . It was as if she had encountered plenty of skeptics before .
"Let me in on another secret, boss . You should know that every expert, ace and god pilot receives a tailor-made custom mech, right?"
"Of course . They're worth the investment and they can't express their full abilities without a mech that fits their strengths . "
"A custom neural interface is the key to facilitating resonance! While it's possible to achieve resonance with a standard interface, it's ten times easier with a connection that is already programmed to strengthen the association connected to the resonance phenomenon!"
That meant that every elite mech pilot above the expert level willingly submitted themselves to a benign form of brainwashing!
Ves could not receive anymore shocks for today . He held his heart and felt awfully conflicted . If Iris spoke the truth, what did it mean for his design philosophy . He held a lot of ambitions . He had no doubt that in the future that he would design plenty of elite mechs for experts and aces worthy to receive his assistance .
With the current direction his design philosophy developed towards, Ves would have to accept a handicap if he wanted to design an elite mech!
Time seemed to freeze as his doubts and mental conflicts came to a head . He felt as if he needed to make a clear decision on the spot .
A question bubbled up from his mind. "Why does the MTA tolerate mind manipulation to this extent?"
"Why does the CFA prohibit everyone from building armed warships while they field countless armadas of them? Why do the Big Two prohibit the use of weapons of mass destruction while employing them liberally in punitive actions? All of them stem from the same reason. Can you guess why?"
Ves frowned and puzzled over what they shared in common. "Is it because the CFA and MTA is powerful enough to ignore their own rules?"
"That’s part of it. They aren’t being hypocrites for the fun of it. The reason why they break their own rules is because doing so increases their power. It’s simple as that. Do you think humanity will last against the the aliens occupying the other half of the galaxy if we outlaw all of our warships? That’s too naive! It’s the same story with weapons of mass destruction. Just because our society moved past their use doesn’t mean we can afford to abandon them entirely!"
This was a familiar refrain to Ves. The Common Fleet Alliance often justified the necessity of wielding enough power to wipe out every inhabited planet in human space by claiming that they needed it to stop the aliens from doing it themselves.
It helped that the two trans-galactic organizations largely kept by their promises and didn’t abuse their power. Humanity had begun to take their neutrality and self-appointed caretaker roles for granted.
Despite their obscure leadership and murky governance, trust in the two overarching organizations never wavered after the commencement of the Age of Mechs. They guarded the current order and most humans in the galaxy thought they did a pretty decent job.
Anything beat the waning days of the Age of Conquest.
"Okay, just because the CFA and MTA are allowed to get away with breaking their own rules doesn’t mean that mech designers should be allowed to do the same. Is the power boost really worth the risk of irrevocably damaging the brains of elite pilots?"
"Your tone suggests that even the slightest risk will lead to disastrous consequences. That’s not the right way to look at this issue. Everything of value carries some risk. Take fire, for instance. Long before our race has left for the stars, our primitive ancestors hunted animals and foraged berries to sate their hunger. The discovery of fire advanced their civilization to a remarkable degree. Fire can hurt, yes, but it can also cook our meals or help with forging the building blocks of a permanent civilization."
"Fire is different from mental manipulation through a neural interface. You could argue that the former is absolutely necessary for the advancement of humanity, but mechs work fine without the latter."
"I disagree." She said. "Beyond a certain point, there is a limit to how much we can maximize the performance of a design. Highly advanced technologies and miraculous exotics are extremely expensive to licence and reproduce. On the other hand, up to a certain point, neural interfaces are mostly identical. It’s not the hardware, but the software that gives them an edge. An exquisitely-programmed neural interface can elevate the performance of a man-machine combination by as much as fifty percent, all without adding to the material cost of the mech!"
Ves shook his head. "Just because it’s cheap isn’t a good reason to resort to such a dangerous practice."
"Then let me give you a more practical reason. Even if you decline to make use of this tool, others won’t. The entire reason why every elite mech makes use of mental manipulation is because their competitors are certainly trying to maximize their utility. Not only can they complement the mental blind spots of their mech pilots, they also make it a lot easier and more intuitive to call upon resonance. Remember Lord Javier’s flashy last stand. You might think he’s an idiot for naming and calling out his special moves, but it’s a way to trigger a predetermined routine that facilitates the activation of a specific resonance effect. Granted, most mech pilots don’t broadcast their moves in the open air."
"Hold on for a couple of minutes. I need to think this through."
This was new information to Ves. Perhaps that was why Lord Javier didn’t go down easy. Constantine Reeve must have incorporated a custom neural interface that covered for the weaknesses in his piloting style. In addition, if the neural interface registered all of his special techniques beforehand, then it was extremely easy to trigger them by calling out specific phrases.
This put the issue in a complicated light. Though Ves had only heard about this from Iris, Ves didn’t need to corroborate her claims from another source. She was an expert in this matter and had no reason to lie. His intuition also led him to believe that she spoke the truth.
Where did that leave him? Should he revise his entire stance towards manipulating the minds of mech pilots?
In truth, it wasn’t as if Ves did something similar with the X-Factor. As he grew increasingly more proficient in Spirituality, his designs began to make a definite impact on the moods and thoughts of the mech pilots that used his products.
Was he a hypocrite to accept his own brand of affecting minds while rejecting something similar through the use of neural interfaces?
Ves closed his eyes and breathed deeply.
No, it was not the same. Neural interfaces were exceedingly delicate and it only took a single misstep to damage a mech pilot’s mind. As for the X-Factor, though they might push a mech pilot to do things they didn’t want to perform, as far as Ves was aware of, a mech’s spirituality never hurt any mech pilots.
They worked on two completely different levels. Neural interfaces manipulated through physiological means, while the X-Factor worked in the imaginary realm. The former imposed specific behavior onto mech pilots, while the latter expressed the living thoughts and instincts of the imaginary entity that Ves attached to the designs.
One was dead, while the other was alive.
"That’s the difference."
Other mech designers treated mechs as a lifeless tool. Tools weren’t alive, and certainly wouldn’t be able to express their own thoughts.
In contrast, his mechs possessed the spark of life. As living entities, they deserved a say in the manner of which they would be used. Through the X-Factor, mechs transferred some of their thoughts, instincts and skills to their pilots so that the latter wouldn’t dominate the man-machine connection.
"It’s a partnership."
Perhaps his rationalization sounded a little dubious, but it resolved his dilemma concerning the use of X-Factor. Ves no longer felt conflicted about influencing the minds of mech pilots through this transcendent method.
Ves could describe his forays into the X-Factor and Spirituality as an attempt to elevate mechs into becoming equal partners to mech pilots. It was a noble if fanciful goal that Ves aspired to achieve some day.
As for resorting to crass manipulation through the neural interface, Ves felt nothing but disgust at the method. It was like trying to get a mech pilot to adopt a certain pattern of behavior by injecting them with stimulants.
Strangely enough, Ves felt as if something changed within him as he resolved his internal struggle. He suspected that his nascent design philosophy became a bit more substantial after defining some of the thoughts he previously took for granted.
He turned back to Iris. "I don’t agree with your notion. I believe that mechs can still be good without the use of such a dangerous method. Do elite mechs exist that don’t resort to manipulative neural interfaces?"
"There are, but they’re very rare. A mech simply isn’t responsive enough if they come with the most restrictive neural interfaces. I don’t think I’ve heard of any mech designer who advanced into a Master Mech Designer while ignoring the obvious advantages of a custom neural interface. What you’re pursuing is a dead end."
Maybe she was right, but Ves didn’t give up. His design philosophy pushed him to make a stand. He may be able to lie to everyone, but he couldn’t lie to himself. Even if he opted for the hardest choice, he didn’t regret his decision.
"I’m sorry, Iris, but I truly can’t agree with your proposition. Call me a fool, but as an mech designer, I believe that every dead end can be engineered around. An alternative just hadn’t been found yet."
"Many mech designers have tried and failed." She sighed. "Will you follow in their futile footsteps? Trying to avoid one dead end simply leads to other dead ends. The best and brightest of the galaxy have tried to tackle this problem and failed to come up with a solution without any exception. Do you believe yourself to be a messiah who can save us from the oppression of manipulative neural interface? Give me a break, boss."
Ves sensed that he might have lowered her regard for him with his mule-headed resolve. He couldn’t help it. In order to maintain the integrity of his design philosophy, he couldn’t allow himself to compromise on his ideals. Even a single exception could introduce a crack in his design philosophy, and might even bar him from advancing to Journeyman for the rest of his life.
"Even if we disagree on this matter, that doesn’t mean I don’t find your lessons useful." Ves spoke in an attempt to placate her. "I’d like to learn the ins and outs about neural interfaces, if only so I can understand their workings and recognize if they are being fudged. You can tailor your lessons in this direction."
Though Iris looked as if she wanted to leave the office, she relented and resumed her teaching, if only begrudgingly. Ves attentively listened and with his incredible Intelligence, he had no problem trying to follow the theories she espoused.
At the end of the shift, Ves received enough of a crash course to embark on his own studies, though it would be very troublesome to get his hands on the restricted books.
"Does your access to the central database allow you to access a textbook on neural interfaces?" Iris asked.
Ves tried it out but quickly faced a block. Even head designers couldn’t unlock any materials regarding neural interfaces. He’d have to knock on Professor Velten’s door to remove this block.
"It’s a shame, but maybe it’s for the better. I can’t imagine that those who read these books from scratch have a high chance of screwing up."
That meant he would be reliant on continued lessons in order to develop a shallow but broad of neural interfacing technology.
"You better teach me well for my trouble, sir." Iris demanded. "I’m in a lot of trouble for telling you this much already."
"You definitely won’t lose out, Iris."
They seperated at the end of the day. While Iris left the office first, Ves stayed back and did some last-minute work to prepare for what might happen next.
"We’re scheduled to arrive at the next star system sometime tomorrow."
Throughout the past few days, Ves received word of intel that their destination star system might host unwanted guests. From Iris, he heard that the regional rebels hadn’t managed to deliver on their promises. What that actually entailed, Ves didn’t know. Iris directly brought the news to Major Verle, upon which he quickly issued some orders that increased the battle readiness of his task force.
All signs pointed out to immediate trouble at the other end.
"Is it Imodris? Have they finally caught up with us?"
As one of the most powerful duchies in the Vesia Kingdom, Ves had long believed they wouldn’t let the Flagrant Vandals go without a fight.
The past week of inactivity only increased his unease. If Imodris wanted to take revenge for the raid of their star systems, then the next star system should be their last chance to do so themselves. Once the fleet crossed into the Venidse Duchy, Imodris wouldn’t be able to follow them through as they would encroach on the territory of their rival.
"We’ll see what happens tomorrow."
Ves felt grateful to Iris for opening his eyes. Learning the truth about the incorporation of manipulative neural interfaces in custom mechs and elite mechs gave him another goal to work towards.
Rather than lamenting the deplorable practices of today, Ves aimed to effect a change. Whether he was being arrogant or inspiring remained to be seen. He believed that no matter whether he was right or wrong, the best mech designers should be bold and confident in their direction.
After all, if Ves followed the most popular path, he wouldn’t be treading any new ground. What was the point of becoming a mech designer if every mech he designed was no different from anyone else’s?
"It’s safer to imitate than to innovate."
That sounded somewhat familiar to Ves. He thought back to the time he looked up the first original designs of his colleagues within the fleet. Many mech designers who never started their own businesses simply opted to tread the path of least resistance by designing obvious rip offs of existing designs.
Ves disapproved of such a lazy choice, but he was realistic enough to know that copying each other’s works happened all the time. A mech designer with a limited skill set could flex their design prowess in so many ways. Though they should have taken the effort to expand their reah and learn how to design a true original mech, Ves didn’t blame anyone for opting for the convenience of cribbing a famous existing design.
"They’ll only be limiting their own future progress."
This wasn’t any great secret. Opting to stick close to established designs allowed mech designers to overcome the difficult hurdles at the start of their careers. Many mech designers weren’t even able to get off the starting point, so the desperation was evident. An easier start was well worth the price of facing a harsher bottleneck in the future.
Where did that leave Ves, for that matter?
"I’m different from the others. Unlike most of my colleagues, I can depend on my comprehensive Skills and my Creativity to design an original creation. I won’t be lost if I don’t have any recipes on hand."
Naturally, he had to admit that making use of the System made it a lot easier to get to this point. If Ves remained a conventional mech designer, then he might have needed at least a century of dedicated study and work to reach this level. Having reached this point in two-and-a-half years since the start of his career sounded very promising.
"I can afford to be bolder in my choices since nobody can match my specific advantage. I don’t need to follow a conventional track to advancement."
Working for the Flagrant Vandals may have curtailed opportunities do design his own mechs, but the circumstances he became exposed to help him in many other ways. Each difficult problem made him reflect on his design philosophy and forced him to make some tough decisions. No matter what answer he came up with, they all fleshed out his vision towards mech design.
"I probably won’t be able to advance to Journeyman during my time here, but I’ll be able accumulate more insights."
Still, all of those thoughts didn’t help him with the task force’s more acute problems. Ves needed to rest before the fleet emerged out of FTL. He wanted to be in the best condition.
Ves stretched his arms and retired for the day. Strictly speaking, he could go without sleep, but he still benefited if he kept to a regular human sleeping pattern.
The next day, the mood throughout the Shield of Hispania turned tense all of a sudden. The Vandal crewmembers traversing the corridors ceased their easy-going or jovial behavior and adopted a sense of preparation. Nobody appeared to slack off, and everyone aboard readied the combat carrier for heavy action.
Ves stopped by his office to confirm his last preparations and to see whether his subordinates hadn’t slacked off. To his disappointment, the results the other mech designers had achieved in the last few days was inconsistent.
Many of the lower-ranked mech designers definitely worked harder than usual due to the reward he dangled in front of them. The real problem was that the higher-ranked mech designers failed to match the enthusiasm of their lessers. Certainly, a small handful felt motivated to compete for the reward, but other mech designers didn’t even seem to try to win the privilege of borrowing a valuable textbook from the Mech Corps.
"Iris, can you explain something to me?"
She sighed. "What is it, boss?"
"Why aren’t the higher-ranking mech designers valuing the opportunity to borrow a textbook from the central database?"
"That’s easy to answer, Mr. Larkinson. They already enjoy similar types of access. Maybe they’ve earned a lot of merits, or maybe they are part of an organization that offers much of the same."
"Even so, good textbooks aren’t easy to access."
"Don’t underestimate the backgrounds of your underlings. Someone like Bovis Mercator isn’t arrogant without a reason, you know. Though none of us have the benefit of being apprenticed to a Master Mech Designer, we all have our reasons for making it this far."
That was a fair answer, and it sounded logical as well. Higher-ranked mech designers almost always relied on a strong advantage or two to reach this point. To certain people, obtaining excellent textbooks posed no trouble at all.
"Seems like my first carrot isn’t working for everybody. I’ll have to figure out some other bait to attract the rest."
"I don’t see why you need to bother, sir. You’re obviously aiming to establish a connection with those who want to learn from you. As long as you’ve formed enough relationships, you don’t need to befriend the rest."
Ves thought it over and figured that she had a better point than him. In any case, he would eventually relinquish the position of head designer, so it wasn’t worthwhile for him to invest too much.
"Are you ready to find out what we’ll face in the next star system?"
"Not really." Iris shook his head. "From what I’ve heard, Imodris has mobilized a significant amount of emergency assets to lock down this part of space. I don’t know for certain what we’ll face, but it won’t be good."
"If we enter into battle, make sure your emergency gear is working all-right. You never know when you might be forced to evacuate the Shield of Hispania."
She laughed. "Thanks for your concern, boss, but I have a lot of tricks up my sleeves."
The next hours progressed agonizingly slow as the time to transition out of FTL soon came to pass.
Just like last time during a space battle, Ves had been invited to the command center by Major Verle. This time, he invited Iris as well, more for her contacts with the VRF than any insights she could provide as a mech designer.
"Miss Jupiter." Major Verle greeted cordially. "Per our agreement with the Vesian Revolutionary Front, we’ve unlocked a communications channel for your use. You can find the option embedded in the menu system of your secure seat."
Ves sank his body down onto a familiar-looking chair. He knew that should the unthinkable happen again, his seat would envelop him in a crash ball and keep him safe as best as possible while they tumbled out into space.
This time though, they would likely fight away from any planets or suns. That meant if Ves got flung away in a random direction, his skeleton would very likely continue making this millenia-long journey through the void.
"Ah, major, the VRF has just transferred a new update to us." She said after reading the notice that had been queuing up in her comm. "Their scout vessels have been sniffed out from their hiding places by their counterparts from Imodris. They’ve been driven out of the star system short time ago. Some of their hidden bugs remain, but they don’t have the numbers and fidelity to scan an entire star system."
"It’s better than nothing. Provide me with their fleet composition."
"There are too many unknowns! Before they had been driven out, the rebels have counted at least twelve scout ships!"
"Damn! That many scouts means that the main fleet is right behind our heels!" Major Verle erupted. "How did they figure out our destination?"
He instantly set the fleet to the second-highest alert status. Anyone acting suspiciously or wandering in the areas off-limits to them would be arrested or fired upon immediately.
Ves looked fairly relaxed compared to anyone, but that was because he finished most of his work beforehand. He knew he needed to reserve most of his energy to serve as a mech analyst in order to provide Major Verle with sensible suggestions.
"Five minutes until transition."
He looked at Iris who was currently having a private conversation with someone from the VRF. She hadn’t forgiven him yet for yesterday’s clash. Ves hoped she would mellow out and forget the clash in beliefs after today. They had more things to worry about than a philosophical disagreement.
"Four minutes until transition."
Ves actually looked forward to resuming his lessons. Neural interfaces formed somewhat of a black hole to his knowledge base. Becoming familiar with how they worked allowed him to gain a head start compared to his peers."
"Three minutes until OOOPHHH!"
The Shield of Hispania lurched, and their stomachs lurched as well. Fortunately, everyone had strapped themselves down so nobody flew in wild directions. Only a couple of unsecured objects fell from the tables or other surfaces.
"Sitrep now!"
"We’ve been forced out of FTL! Detecting gravitic anomalies in the vicinity! An unknown force has planted an artificial gravity disturbance on our direct path to the destination star system! We are several light-minutes beyond our estimated emergence point!"
Ves, Iris, Major Verle and many others realized the significance of this act. Imodris or whoever laid in wait had deduced their exact trajectory and laid a trap at the end.
One of the combat carriers of the fleet lurched again as something exploded against her hull!
"Detecting mines! They are homing in on our ships!"
"Bring our Akkara mechs into position and sortie our mechs! We need all hands on deck to beat back this ambush!"
This was an ambush, plain and simple.
"Are there any mechs or ships in the vicinity?!" Major Verle asked the sensor operator.
"None found so far, sir, but they could be lurking nearby in stealth and with most of their systems off! The disruptors planted in the vicinity and the mines that are constantly exploding around us is interfering with our proximity scans!"
A minute passed as several ships got battered by mines. Ves understood that whoever laid this field opted to go for quantity instead of quality. The mines also didn’t seem to be of the most expensive variant, so most of the combat carriers could cope with the blasts.
The real danger lay in what was next. This mine field appeared to be endless and they hadn’t even met the actual culprits in combat yet. Furthermore, while the combat carriers could cope with the mines for now, their transports and logistics ships wouldn’t be able to survive more than a single mine. Protecting them from the mines that homed in on them proved to be a demanding task, especially since it appeared the mines received some sort of signal that changed their targeting priority.
"The mines are trying to go around our combat carriers! They are targeting our logistics ships!"
"Keep firing upon them!"
Mechs emerged from the hangar bay hatches and moved to intercept the rather stealthy mines. While their payloads weren’t very impressive, they made up for it in speed and maneuverability. Many ranged mech pilots exhibited a lot of trouble in trying to shoot them down.
"Our adversaries are trying to exhaust us!" A tactical officer asserted. "From what our scans have detected so far, this mine field encompasses an estimated amount of 100,000 mines!"
That was enough to blow up the entire task force ten times over if they all hit their ships!
Interception happened fairly frequently in chases. A force with a superior number of ships would cast a net over a range of star systems and observe every ship transitioning in and out of FTL. If they spotted a fleet heading into a specific direction, as long as the sensors captured enough details, it was possible to trace a line between the starting point and the end point.
Naturally, the line only served as a rough guide. FTL travel followed curves instead of straight lines, and a more turbulent gravitic environment distorted the actual route even further.
Therefore, intercepting a ship in FTL by laying down gravitic disturbances at the midpoint was plainly unrealistic. It would be like casting a man-sized net into an enormous river.
In addition, the current level of FTL technology at the Komodo Star Sector’s disposal didn’t allow ships to stop midway. Ships could only set their destination on some sort of gravitic anchor such as star systems, black holes or rogue planets.
Thus, setting a possible ambush at a possible midpoint was moot, because the ambushing force wouldn’t be able to reach that area of space in the first place.
The best solution would be to ambush a fleet at or near the end destination. The closer a ship reached her destination, the more it funneled closer along the line that ran through the starting point and the destination point.
This made it possible to lay down a minefield and sprinkle it with gravitic mines to act as FTL disturbances.
Even then, the odds of catching a fleet was minimal due to unreliable intelligence and the randomness involved with FTL travel. In truth, the star system laid down several different minefields spread out over other possible approach angles.
This increased the odds of catching their prey.
In truth, the Verle Task Force was bound to be caught in a net of gravitic mines once they decided to jump to this system. The trapping force had cast too many nets at the mouth of the river.
"Identify those mines!"
"I got it!" Ves said as he finished matching the parameters of the mines to the ones in the database. "It’s the MEX-LIGHT 25-E, from the same manufacturer as the XX-REX missiles! They’re military-grade light mines fabricated from Imodris!"
Imodris had finally caught up to them!
"Tell me more!"
Ves quickly read through the traits of these mines. "The MEX-LIGHT mines are meant to be employed as traps. They’re stealthy, light, networked, cheap and are built to be fast! They aren’t very evasive but due to their speed it becomes possible to spread them very wide, covering the highest volume possible. Their only weakness is that they don’t have much of a payload, but because they’re employed in an enormous volume that isn’t too much of a problem!"
"We are getting stung by a hive of bees." Major Verle concluded.
This succinctly described their current predicament. Bees couldn’t deal much damage to a human, but once they gathered in a swarm, they gained the ability to deal fatal damage.
Because the minefield encompassed a huge volume, it took a lot of time for the mines to boost towards the ships in their midst.
Every space mine possessed powerful but short-ranged thrusters that allowed them to mimic missiles in some sense. Though they lacked some of the capabilities of true missiles, it nonetheless allowed them to approach their targets instead of passively waiting for their targets to bump into them at point-blank range.
Every second, more mines converged onto the task force. Fortunately, the Vandals had been prepared for every eventuality so they deployed remarkably quickly. The ranged mechs took out mines from afar while the Akkara heavy mechs that hid behind the bunkers built along the hulls of the combat carrier acted as the last resort.
Mine impacts began to decrease, but they never ceased!
The Flagrant Vandals never employed enough ranged mechs. Their bias towards melee mechs came to bite them back with vengeance. It would be suicide for melee mechs to destroy the mines up close, as they possessed just enough power to take out a mech in a single blast.
Still, while the Vandals didn’t have much experience in dealing with minefields, they encountered this kind of situation a number of times.
"Arm the useless melee mechs with any spare rifles we can give them!" Major Verle ordered.
"Sir, that would put us at risk of a mech ambush!"
"No enemy force would want to mingle in this minefield! The odds of friendly fire is too great! Still, leave twenty percent as guards but arm the rest!"
The Vandals fielded an overwhelming amount of humanoid mechs, and this provided them with a lot of flexibility. Swordsman mechs and spearman mechs holstered their primary weapons for bog-standard laser rifles. The melee mechs wielded the rifles awkwardly, as their limbs lacked the delicate precision that was necessary to handle them with accuracy.
Nonetheless, the melee mechs didn’t need to be too accurate. As long as they kept shooting, they were bound to hit one of the mines, especially since the mines single-mindedly approached the fleet at the cost of evasion.
The situation came under control as the task force intercepted most of the mines on approach.
"Damage report!"
"Light to moderate damage to armor cover throughout the fleet! The Antecedent sustained the heaviest damage!"
"Good!" Major Verle grinned.
The Antecedent was one of their fatter combat carriers. Though she lost her original compressed armor coverage, the bulk of her cheaper armor made her more resilient than the Shield of Hispania. During this ambush, the Antecedent released the strongest signals, acting as a beacon for ordnance to home in on.
Other ships suffered a fair amount of damage as well. Some impacts even targeted the same armor section, causing it to lose all protection and exposing the closest compartments to the vacuum of space.
Bee stings or not, successive mine explosions hurt the combat carriers a lot.
Even worse was this might only be the start.
"Minefields are never left alone! There should be some ships from Imodris lurking in the vicinity! Watch for signs beyond the minefield!"
Unfortunately, their sensors detected nothing at all. The constant mine detonations only made it harder to find an enemy that tried their best to hide.
"Identify the shortest distance to the edge of the minefield and orient our heading towards that direction! We need to escape this field!"
It took some more scanning but they finally managed to develop a vague estimation of the scope of the minefield. The Vandal ships had emerged from FTL in the lower portion of a massive sphere. They only needed to traverse a third of the sphere’s radius to escape the minefield.
The only problem was that the sphere was in the process of contracting. Every mine received instructions from a hidden vessel that transmitted the exact coordinates of the Vandals. Thus, it would take a lot of time to build up speed and shake off the mines.
Major Verle ordered the ships to move in any case. Mines generally couldn’t move for long before running out of fuel, so the most effective way to shake off the mines was to wait for them to expire.
Yet to do so would take too long.
A change overcame the mines. They no longer tried to press into the Vandals as frantically as before. Their pacing became more measured. Fewer mines came in, allowing the defenders to relax and even rotate their defense.
"We haven’t managed to detect any enemy vessels in the vicinity, sir." The tactical officer reported. "This tells us that Imodris likely hasn’t deployed enough ships to threaten us. This minefield has been laid out on a contingency. If Imodris has readied a fleet, it must be elsewhere. It will take at least an hour to several days for that fleet to converge on our location. The minefield is has gone from trying to destroy our ships to trying to delay our escape."
Though this reduced the chances of sustaining significant damage, no one smiled, including Major Verle. "Reinforcements are on the way. If we fall for their stalling tactics, it will be too late to escape once their main fleet arrives. Seems like Imodris has learned from Venidse."
Ves and Major Verle expected to face these kinds of situations from Venidse. It was right out of their playbook. First, they spread out mines and mixed them with gravitic emitters. Once their nets caught a fish, their heavy fleets converged on the fish that frantically tried to escape. Once Venidse’s forces caught up with the trapped fish, they would ground it down and make it impossible for it to escape.
"We need to get out this trap!" Verle stated. "Find me a solution!"
The endless mines made it impossible for the ships to transition back into FTL. It was as if someone tried to sleep but the person next to them snored like a trumpet. There was no escape from their predicament unless they changed their situation.
Ves tried to look through the central database to see if they developed any hacking solutions for the MEX-LIGHT mines. He found nothing. "The mines are too new. The Mech Corps hasn’t been able to crack their programming yet."
Relying on the hackers serving with the Vandals to hack the mines was unrealistic. They needed months or years to overcome their virtual security. Imodris would only give them a day at most to get away.
Ves concluded that unless they retained a genius hacker, the Flagrant Vandals wouldn’t be able to do a thing about the mines. Other than shooting them, they would continue to obey the programming of the hidden Imodris stealth ship lurking just outside the minefield.
Even destroying the stealth ship wouldn’t change anything as the mines would continue to follow their last instructions. Even without any human holding their hands, mines could persist for decades trying to follow the same order.
"How long until we escape this minefield?!"
"At least six hours, depending on their fuel reserves!"
"Too long!"
The mines obviously switched to some sort of fuel-efficient mode. This allowed them to move around for an extended period of time. That the controllers opted to switch to this mode meant they felt confident that their reinforcements would arrive in less than six hours.
As the command center’s officers attempted various solutions, often without result, Ves continued to scour the database for possible solutions.
He couldn’t find any viable solution. The military-grade space mines left no loopholes for them to exploit. Ves also lacked the expertise to attempt to hack the mines himself or interfere with their programming.
He wanted to pull out a solution so badly, but with no mechs in sight, most of his expertise couldn’t be brought to bear.
Right now, the mech officers kept it all together. Their mechs had been split up into three shifts. Each of them took turns to shoot down the relentless mines. Once a shift ran low of energy or ammunition, they swapped with the next shift and replenished their supplies. This happened on and on for hours because they couldn’t think of anything better.
All the while, a hidden doomsday clock ticked above their heads. At the predestined time, their end would come in the form of a massive Imodris punitive fleet.
"Iris. Is there no way the rebels can lend us a hand?"
She shook her head. "I’m sorry but all of their assets have been chased away from this star system. Besides, they won’t be of much help even if we do enlist their aid. They aren’t particularly well-equipped."
This highlighted their helplessness in the face of an enemy trap. No matter what, for their FTL trajectory to be predicted accurately to this extent meant that they had some traitors among the Vandals. At the very least, an insider leaked valuable navigation data to the enemy.
The traitor might even be transmitting their telemetry to the enemy right now!
Ves looked up and activated a rare command. He wanted to speak to Major Verle in private.
Ves conveyed his suspicions about a traitor among the Vandals to Major Verle after the latter accepted his request for a private conversation. Privacy screens enveloped them both as they talked among themselves.
The mech commander didn’t look pleased. "Even I can figure that out Mr. Larkinson, but what will that help? My ships and mechs are surrounded by mines and it will take hours for us to disentangle from them! If your solution doesn’t help us get out faster, it’s not worth my time!"
"Sir, we already inferred there is at least one Imodris stealth ship in the vicinity that is directing the minefield. What if the traitor in our midst is transmitting our telemetry to them? I want to find this traitor not to shut him up, but to piggyback on his signal to the enemy presence. Once we know the approximate coordinates of the enemy ship, we have more options available to us."
Ves actually didn’t know how useful that information would be, but Major Verle definitely took note. "I’m intrigued, but I can’t allocate any personnel to search for the traitor. You can be assured that our quantum entanglement nodes are locked down, so those who are attempting to transmit something will have to resort to regular methods."
The major basically foisted this task on his lap without any further help. Ves was only willing do pursue this matter because he didn’t have anything else to do. Trying to crack the mines was impossible, while the enemy hadn’t shown off any mechs for him to analyze.
Ves did keep one eye on the status of each mech designer in the task force. So far, they all remained at their stations and on standby. No mechs sustained any damage so far, and the most complicated operations the mech technicians had to perform was to replenish supplies.
They could do without his supervision. In any case, they wouldn’t try to pull anything off while Imodris aimed to kill them all. With their survival at stake, the mech designers definitely did their best.
At least he thought so. "Could one of our mech designers be the traitor?"
The possibility was real. If they worked for the enemy, they could do a lot of damage. Their position enabled them access to many mechs, all of which they could tamper in various ways. They also possessed the technical acumen to screw around with computer systems, thereby installing some sort of backdoor through which they could transmit hidden signals to an unknown receiver.
After some thought, he eventually ruled it out. First, the Mech Corps already screened everyone’s identities, and even if the Vandals got the dregs, they still passed at least a minimal security check. Secondly, mech designers never worked in isolation. All of their actions received scrutiny, whether it was from the everpresent security surveillance or from the mech technicians that received their instructions from them. A mech designer almost never worked alone.
Still, that didn’t rule out mech designers entirely as a risk. Since they fell under his responsibility, Ves checked them out one by one. He pulled up live feeds that watched over the mech designers and skimmed them over, looking for any signs that seemed suspicious.
Though he eventually found a handful of figures who attempted to do some shady activities, Ves tentatively ruled out the possibility that they passed on information to someone else.
"Too many of them are working alongside the mech technicians."
He took a step back and regarded the Flagrant Vandals as a whole. If Ves wanted to put a traitor with the Vandals, who should he pick?
"Mech pilots are under too much scrutiny. It should be a ship crewmember of some sorts. Not enlisted personnel, since they often worked alongside their colleagues. It’s more likely that the culprit is an officer. Perhaps a communications officer or a sensor officer."
Major Verle at least handed him a temporary boon that allowed him access to the task force’s entire surveillance system. If Ves wished the Vandals ill, he could do a lot of damage with this expanded access.
Perhaps the only reason why Major Verle expanded his access privileges was because they occupied the same compartment. The mech officer would always be able to keep an eye on his actions while Ves did the heavy lifting.
Ves shrugged at that. They all shared the same goal in the end, and that was to make it out of this trap alive and free.
He began to scour through the feeds depicting the communications and sensor officers with a very wide sweep. He projected dozens of feeds in a grid and ran the footage simultaneously. He strained his enhanced mind to cope with the sheer amount of multitasking needed to interpret the footage.
"Nobody?"
None of the people looked suspicious. They all did their jobs with varying levels of enthusiasm, but Ves didn’t care about that. Though there were many ways in which someone could hide something dastardly in front of someone’s eyes, Ves wouldn’t be able to tell. He didn’t specialize in sniffing out deception. He only investigated these Vandals on a hunch.
"So it’s not the officers, and looking through the enlisted spacers takes too much time."
Where did the traitor hide, presuming that the traitor even existed in the first place. This could all be a suspicion borne out of his habitual paranoia. Only a vague sense of intuition pushed him to continue his search. He thought it would be worthwhile to go through with his investigation. Even if he couldn’t achieve anything else, he would feel better if he verified the trustworthiness of every Vandals.
After ruling out certain officers, Ves shifted his mind onto a different track. "What if it’s not the ship officers at all? Many of our mech pilots come from shady or troubled backgrounds. Who’s to say that they are all repentant and sincere in their time with the Vandals.
Questioning the loyalty of mech pilots was an exceedingly contentious issue. Nobody wanted to be foisted with a baseless accusation of being a traitor, and mech pilots often lashed out with physical violence.
"Eh, what do I care. They’re either sitting in their mechs on standby or have deployed into space to intercept the mines. I only need a brief look to placate my concerns."
Ves began to do the same thing he did with the officers. He called up many feeds and stacked them next to each other so that he could save time.
From looking at their faces, Ves understood that the mech pilots lost some of their edge at the start. The constant and predictable stream of mines made it easier for the Vandals to cope. However, this in fact lulled the Vandal mech pilots into a false sense of security.
The worst thing about their complacency was that Ves couldn’t tell them to pay more attention. The constant mine bombardment would definitely stretch out over hours, so every mech pilot had already prepared to deploy for the long haul.
As Ves swiped his hand over the projection and let another set of footage play in front of his eyes. The same pattern of complacency appeared yet again.
"This might even be the full scope of their trap. Imodris intends to delay our escape, wear down our nerves and lull us in a false sense of security."
Iris turned her head to Ves and nodded. "That’s what makes it so important to get rid of this minefield. There are too many ways in which our opponents can mess with us. They’re only stringing us along because it will take some time to gather enough ships that can match our half-regiment."
Ves already understood that. Imodris had cast a lot of nets, expecting most of them to accomplish nothing of note. The spread of traps over many star systems placed the punitive fleets in a fairly awkward position. They couldn’t possibly split up their forces and garrison each planet with a small handful of military-grade combat carriers.
Ves bet that the main enemy force parked in the most centrally-placed star system. This meant there was an inevitable delay before they arrived at the star system that hosted the net that caught their enemies.
"It’s strange for Imodris to employ this kind of trapping strategy. Do you think that Imodris has let down some of their pride and asked Venidse to collaborate on our capture?"
"That’s simply not possible! Even if their capital planets are bombarded from orbit, they would never deign to ask their rivals for help. Their mutual disagreement is intense. Imodris believes that Venidse’s suppliers charge too much for their export materials, while Vendise thinks that Imodris is taking advantage of them. The rivalry between them reaches the very top, from what we’ve gathered."
"Okay, I can see the chances of collaboration is low. Venidse might not even want to stop us as long as we are still inside the borders of the Imodris Duchy. They want to see their rivals suffer a humiliating defeat."
"That only make Venidse more eager to catch us themselves." Iris pointed out with resignation. "How better to show that they are better than Imodris than to catch a prey that their bumbling neighboring territory had let slip from their grasp?"
"We can worry about that tomorrow. Right now, we need to get out of our current fire."
Ves kept flitting over footage of mech pilots out in space or held back until their shift came up. His eyes raked over hundreds of faces, which all responded in a variety of ways at their current predicament.
Suddenly, Ves stopped swiping his hands to bring up the next set of pilot footage. His eyes narrowed into slits as he studied the peculiar behavior of one of the pilots.
He read out the brief summary of the mech pilot’s profile. "Nemo McAllister. Male, twenty-eight years old. Three-year veteran. Light mech specialist. Known for being a violent drunk. Never let him close to a drink."
Nemo piloted an Inheritor mech. The light skirmisher didn’t come with any ranged weapons that would have been useful in shooting down the mines, but the Vandals handed it a light laser rifle they had in stock. Nemo frantically fired at the mines that entered his arc like his very life depended on it. He wasn’t too bad of a shot either.
This immediately caught his attention. "A three-year veteran isn’t really a veteran at all. We might be facing an onslaught of mines, but they haven’t reached the point of threatening our lives so far. This guy is way too panicky to match our current circumstances."
To Ves, it felt as if the man tried too hard to convey his fears to his observers. This act might not have looked out of place immediately after they dropped out of FTL, but now that a lot of time had passed, everyone should have calmed down somewhat.
"Iris, look at this fellow, will you? Do you think he’s a fake?"
Iris took a brief glance at Nemo. "If he’s a spy, he’s a really bad one. Maybe he’s faking it for another reason. No matter how long I stare at him, I can’t see him as a spy at all."
Even if Nemo wasn’t the phantom that Ves was looking for, his abnormal behavior still merited a closer look. Ves leaned forward and pulled up the Inheritor’s telemetry. Having studied and worked at its design for an extended period of time, Ves gained a good understanding of its workings.
The biggest advantage to becoming head designer was that the Vandals finally pulled open the curtain that hid some of the inner workings of the core components. Parts such as the power reactor or the flight system no longer appeared in the form of black boxes. Ves could intimately study how they ticked at his leisure, though the risks of contaminating his design philosophy still remained.
Though Ves had been busy ever since he became the head designer, he hadn’t neglected this opportunity entirely and briefly studied the uncensored versions of Inheritor, Akkara and Hellcat designs.
This was why he immediately spotted an anomaly in Nemo’s Inheritor.
Who was Nemo McAllister?
Ves didn’t know. He appeared to be one of the younger and more recent Vandal mech pilot recruits. His proficiency in piloting light mechs matched well with the Inheritor light mech, causing his performance to be better than some veterans who normally gravitated towards medium mechs.
Initially, Nemo drew attention due to his panicking expression. It looked very genuine, which was strange since the Flagrant Vandals currently had the situation under control. So long the ambushers from Imodris aimed to stall their escape, they didn’t have to worry too much so long as they continued to shoot down the converging space mines.
This discrepancy prompted Ves to look over the telemetry of Nemo’s Inheritor to see if it exhibited any anomalies.
Ves immediately detected something strange with his sharp eyes. Oh, to a normal mech designer, the telemetry being broadcast appeared absolutely normal.
Its power reactor fed enough power to its flight system and weapon.
Its borrowed light laser rifle heated up and expended a predictable amount of energy with each beam being unleashed.
Its sensors entered the most appropriate scanning mode and linked up with the Vandal battle network to share its readings with the combat carriers.
All of it showed that the Inheritor worked properly, if not for one subtle mistake. The fuel for the emergency boosters embedded in the cockpit did not react properly to the changes in the interior of the mech.
Oh certainly, the fuel warmed up when the interior warmed up, and it cooled down when the heat got shunted away. Yet the rate in which it changed temperature seemed a little strange to Ves. He knew what kind of fuel the cockpit utilized.
Cockpit fuel needed to be steadier than normal in order to insure it wouldn’t spontaneously ignite. They underwent expensive treatment in order to make them safer. It wouldn’t have been cost-effective to let fuel-based mechs run with stabler mixtures of fuel, but it was worth it when it came to infrequent purposes such as feeding the boosters of a cockpit as it ejected from a dying mech.
Ves happened to know the traits of the fuel, so the temperature shifts that Ves witnessed from the telemetry didn’t match up. He came to a quick but incomprehensible conclusion.
"The telemetry in this section is faked."
He scratched his head at the puzzle. Why would anyone attempt to fake the readings for cockpit fuel? Was there something else taking the place of fuel for the ejection system?
Ves tried to dig into this issue a little deeper, but he failed to find out more due to his lack of privileges. It was extremely dangerous for a mech to be too networked. As a remote mech designer, Ves barely possessed any rights besides being able to access the Inheritor’s telemetry.
"I need physical access to inspect this mech."
In the meantime, he couldn’t come to any conclusions. Why would anyone try to tamper with the fuel? And was this the reason why Nemo seemed panicked?
"If someone fudged the cockpit’s ejection system, then Nemo has no escape. If his mech ever got damaged, he’ll have to go down with his mech."
This might be why Nemo constantly looked like he wanted this battle to end as quickly as possible. If he knew about this strange anomaly, then he should certainly cherish his life. At least the other Vandal mech pilots could count on ejecting in time.
He still didn’t understand the point of this. All he knew that a small part of Nemo’s Inheritor was not as it seemed. The best Ves could tell, some mech designer or mech technician removed something in order to make way for another component.
Something important and sensitive enough to hide. Perhaps a hidden transmitter?
He shook his head. It didn’t appear to be a transmitter, as none of the mechs in the vicinity detected any transmissions from the Inheritor. None past the usual transmissions, anyhow.
Ves looked up Nemo’s berth and noted down his Inheritor’s mothership. He dug up some logs and saw that the same trio of mech technicians serviced his mech.
Working on a hunch, Ves inspected some of the other mechs serviced by those mech technicians. Most mechs appeared to be normal to his eyes. Yet his persistence was rewarded when Ves found the same anomaly on another Inheritor mech.
"Again?! What is the purpose of this?"
Besides the two Inheritors, all the other mechs that this group of mech technicians serviced appeared normal and untampered. All of this puzzled Ves to the point where he questioned whether this was an issue he should be digging into right now.
"My goal was to find a possible spy in the crew. Nemo and that other fellow don’t seem like spies."
Nemo looked afraid while the other pilot seemed unaware of his predicament. No matter what was going on, Ves couldn’t allow these unauthorized modifications to persist. Who knew what the suspicious bunch of mech technicians tried to pull off.
The question that came to Ves was what he should do about it. He thought about reporting it to Major Verle, but the issue might only distract the mech officer from the battle. Since mechs came under his purview, Ves decided to solve it on his own.
Since the two mechs were compromised in some fashion, Ves needed to treat them as if they could blow up at any moment. In no way would he feel secure in bringing the mechs back to their berths where they could potentially explode and devastate an entire hangar.
Whether this strange occurrence had anything to do with spies or something else, Ves thought they would be better off if the two suspicious mechs could be cleared before he decided to bring them back to the Finmoth Regal, the high-capacity combat carrier from whence they came.
Ves began to smirk as he began to come up with a devious idea. He turned to his comm and called his deputies, putting them in an impromptu conference call.
"Head designer?"
"Mr. Larkinson."
Ves nodded at Mercator and Trozin. The two most senior mech designers under his command hadn’t outwardly worked against him in the past week. They faithfully discharged their responsibilities without fault, so Ves couldn’t pick a bone with them on that.
No matter. He could still jerk them around in other ways.
"A situation has come up. Two Inheritor mechs that are currently deployed in space exhibit anomalies in the telemetry they send back to the battle network. Both of them happened to be serviced by the same group of three mech technicians. I can’t determine what is different with these mechs, but the lack of documentation or permission for these changes as well as the attempt to hide them from our network warrants an immediate investigation."
"What do we have to do, sir?" Mercator asked impatiently. "Do you wish us to send some guards to detain the mech technicians?"
Ves waved his hand in dismissal. "I’ll leave that to someone else. Your jobs are much more important. Those compromised Inheritors have to be inspected as fast as possible, but it is too risky to bring them back to the Finmoth Regal. I want you two to board a shuttle and go to each Inheritor mech and make an inspection of its cockpit and the internals around it on the spot."
Both of the mech designers looked shocked.
"That’s suicide, sir!" Mercator suddenly blew up. "This is an outrageous demand! You’ll be sending us out into space where hundreds of mechs are firing all kinds of ordnance! You’ll be sending us out into an active battlefield where space mines are constantly exploding all around us!"
Trozin objected as well, though she at least maintained her cool. "Head designer, I respectfully urge you to reconsider. We are currently engaged in a running battle. Our ships and our mechs are constantly accelerating in order to outrun this mobile minefield. If we need to perform an inspection on a mech under these circumstances, the mech needs to stay online with its flight system engaged in order to avoid being left behind. It’s too difficult to inspect a mech’s internals with all of these complications!"
Ves attempted to stare sternly at the two. "Orders are orders. Those mechs could either be carrying bombs that are meant to cripple one of our ships or transmitters that is feeding valuable data to the enemy. I can’t tell, and that’s bad, because this issue might concern the safety of the entire fleet. You two are my best mech designers, so there is none who are more suitable to be sent out than the two of you. Or do you want me to report you two to security for insubordination?"
Both of them shuddered at that threat. The Mech Corps took a dim view on insubordinate behavior, especially when it popped up during battles. Mech pilots could be willful and rebellious, but when the fighting started, they came together as brothers and sisters in arms.
Mech designers might not completely fit in the hierarchy of the Mech Corps, but they happen to share most of their penalties. During an active engagement, Ves was their superior and could issue any reasonable orders to them. Of course, the exact definition of reasonable differed from person to person.
That made the order to investigate the two Inheritors so dangerous. Mercator and Trozin took a brief look at the telemetry that Ves had shown them, who pointed out the anomaly. Though they wouldn’t have been able to detect anything suspicious at the start, once Ves told them what to look for, they sensed the strangeness of these mechs as well.
"What if it’s a bomb?" Mercator tried again. "This is a reasonably possibility, sir. Getting close to probe the suspicious may even cause them to detonate prematurely."
"Haste is of the essence. I’ll generously allow you to borrow some diagnostic bots from the workshops. You can insect them first via remote. However, we can’t rely on machines to do the probing for us. Once the bots clear the Inheritors of apparent threats, I want the two of you to do a personal inspection. Both of you must exit the shuttles to do so."
Despite their objections, Ves refused to be swayed by them. What he suggested might be risky for his deputies, but it was the safest decision when considering the entire fleet.
Actually, it would have been safer to order the mech pilots to abandon the compromised mechs on the spot, but that left his questions unanswered. Ves really wanted to know why that same group of mech technicians tried to hide.
His deputies eventually gave up as they saw that Ves was determined to send them off. With his authority, they requisitioned shuttles for themselves and some crew to man them and assist them with the inspection. The vehicles soon set off.
In order to hasten the inspection and reduce some of the risks, Ves marked the two mechs out with his authority. As the highest-ranking mech designer among the Vandals in the task force, his word carried a decent amount of weight. If he claimed that the two mechs needed to be pulled out of the line of a battle for an emergency inspection, the Vandals didn’t argue against his expert opinion.
Thus, Ves watched with trepidation as the two Inheritors pulled back from the defensive envelope and neared the shuttles launched from the fleet. Once a shuttle came close to one of the suspicious mechs, they matched velocities and acceleration, keeping their relative distance stable.
The shuttle hatches opened up soon after, releasing bots that hovered around the Inheritors while performing scans. Ves stared at his console and saw that the bots hadn’t helped very much. Their scans lacked the power to penetrate the deceptive readings.
"Enough dallying around!" Ves ordered. "Go out there in person!"
The bots returned to the shuttles after another minute of fruitless scanning. Moments later, Mercator and Trozin emerged from the same hatch and began to float towards the mechs. Both of them had chosen to be encased in the thickest hazard suits they could get their hands on, and carried a whole pack of tools on their backs.
Once they reached their assigned mechs, they began to make a thorough investigation. All the while, mines continued to detonate around them while laser beams and projectiles disgorged into space by the hundreds.
"You’re a bastard, you know that?" Iris remarked as Ves filled her in on his actions. "You sent your deputies out into space with nothing but shuttles and hazard suits to protect them from mine blasts and errant projectiles! If Professor Velten was here, she would have overruled your decisions on the spot!"
"Well, it’s too bad that she’s not here." Ves said as seriously as possible. Even if he possessed ulterior motives, he needed to act properly in front of any hidden recorders. "The issue is too delicate to leave for later, for if the mechs are hiding transmitters we should shut them down as fast as possible."
"And what if they contain bombs instead? Sending your deputies out to their deaths will not look good on your record."
"I don’t really care about a leadership position among the Vandals anyway. I’d rather let a proper Journeyman Mech Designer take charge. All I want is to coast through this war with my life intact."
Ves had no opinion on whether Mercator and Trozin came back alive or not. If the mechs hid some sort of bomb or self-destruct sequence, then it would have been a shame for them to perish deep behind enemy lines. Ves would shed no tears for their passing.
He only accepted his appointment as head designer because he didn’t trust the rest to do as well as him. The moment someone competent arrived, Ves would willingly relinquish his authority on the spot.
"I’m only doing this job because it’s necessary."
He valued developing his abilities as a mech designer over learning how to lead. If it came down to it, Ves would always be able to find some trusted helpers to manage those matters on his behalf. The most important priority to Ves should always be to push his Skills to their limits.
Minutes passed as the two mech designers carefully opened up some ports along the frame of the Inheritors. They peeled aside some layers of armor and began to peer inside the hot and active internals. If not for their hazard suits, the hot rays would have cooked their flesh even through vacuum.
"They aren’t carrying any bombs."
This news came as a relief to the deputies out in open space. Somehow, this news disappointed Ves somewhat. Still, he remained intrigued as the scans pierced past the clever electronic camouflage and revealed the truth.
"It’s a transmitter!" Mercator exclaimed as he parted the veil a little faster than Trozin. "I’ve never seen a transmitter of this design in my life! It’s larger than any other communications device I’ve seen on a mech!"
Trozin happened to know a little more of the hidden component. "It’s a one-way transmitter that is built for stealth. It’s ideal for subtle transmissions over a fairly short distance. The gravitic coils you see on its exterior is meant to propagate according to special frequencies. It’s a way of communicating through gravity!"
"Does it contain any self-destruct?"
"None so far as I’m aware of in the rest of the mech, sir, but I’m unable to say for sure when it comes to the gravitic transmitter."
"That’s good. I want the two of you to dismantle this gravitic transmitter in order make certain the mechs don’t contain any hidden threats!"
"What about the mech pilots?"
"Have them put the mechs under remote command and tell them to board the shuttles. I don’t want to take the risk of sparking a panic or emotional outburst."
Ves closed his eyes and sighed. So the Vandals carried some spies after all. From the looks of it, the culprits shouldn’t be mech pilots who cluelessly or apprehensively brought their mechs out in the open.
It was possible to control mechs without a mech pilot. Some mechs came installed with so-called autopilots. While they wouldn’t substitute for an actual mech pilot in battle, these stupid AIs still found some use as valets and if a mech pilot fell unconscious.
The autopilots of the two Inheritors kept up with the fleet as Nemo and the other pilot dutifully emerged from their cockpits while in space. Even though the mech pilots had a lot of questions, the current crisis didn’t allow for them to make any requests. They needed to get out of the way as quickly as possible.
Ves had to hand it to them, but his deputies didn’t get flushed. They utilized a variety of bots to operate their tools from a safer distance. This was fairly delicate work, but Mercator and Trozin appeared to possess some experience with operating tools through bots.
Thus, the transmitters carefully lost their protective layers, allowing Ves and his deputies to study their inner components.
"There doesn’t seem to be anything dangerous, but it looks as if the transmitter might fry itself if someone tampered with it. This is a little difficult." Ves determined from his own inspection.
"What do I do, Mr. Larkinson?"
Both his deputies had finally realized the import of their findings. Despite their complaints to Ves, they withheld their acid tones because they truly needed to cooperate at this moment. This crisis was bigger than their internal rivalries.
"Continue to take it apart. Even if everything gets fried, it’s better than leaving them active."
As his deputies resumed the dismantlement, Ves finally composed a report to Major Verle. The situation had grown to a point where the commanding officer needed to be informed. As soon as Ves sent the command, the major immediately began to read his words.
Verle looked up quickly. "Gravitic transmitters? Inside one of our mechs? Unacceptable!"
He quickly issued an arrest order for the trio of mech technicians that presumably installed the gravitic transmitters. Major Verle nodded to Ves in appreciation.
"You’re doing a good job, Mr. Larkinson. You’re more diligent than Mr. Brandstad in some ways. However, don’t make any major decisions without my say so again."
"Understood, sir. I’ll try to bring you into the loop sooner."
Now that Ves handed over his findings to Major Verle, he could rely on the Flagrant Vandals to continue the investigation without his help. Right now, they still needed to fight, but once their current crisis faded away, he definitely intended to follow up on the matter.
Ves thought about the implications. He strongly believed the gravitic transmitters had been installed to communicate with any nearby Vesian assailants. There shouldn’t have been any other purpose to their inclusions because the gravitic waves easy lost a lot of strength as the distance stretched further.
"Who would do such a thing?" Ves asked aloud. "How can spies even infiltrate our ranks?"
Iris paused her own work and patted his back. "The Flagrant Vandals isn’t a standard mech regiment, boss. They get the dregs of the Mech Corps, remember? Their background checks aren’t as formidable as the ones performed by an elite mech company. All manner of scum could have slipped past."
"I happen to be one of them." Ves stated for some reason. "The Mech Corps was evidently concerned about my conflicts of interests and foreign ties that they didn’t dare send me anywhere important. I think they must have wanted to put me away in some forgotten corner of the front. They probably never thought the Vandals intended to perform a deep raid."
"Well, it seems like the Mech Corps has proven their point, sir. This kind of sabotage would never work with a genuine mech regiment."
Ves couldn’t completely rule out the Vesians as the culprits, but for lack of a better explanation, Ves simply rolled with it. He found the idea that a third party lurked while the Vandals and the forces from Imodris duked it out to be implausible.
"Occams razor. The simplest explanation for these gravitic transmitters is that they are intended to convey data to the Vesians, or perhaps Imodris in particular."
While Ves waited for the strange modules to be dismantled from their mechs and the battle to enter a new phase, he reflected a little more on what he discovered. He eagerly wanted to patch into the interrogation of those mech technicians, but internal security appeared to operate through a completely different set of channels, denying him the opportunity to request anything from the people who kept the Vandals in line.
This mystery really nagged at his mind. He felt as if he bumped into a huge threat, of which he uncovered the tip of the iceberg.
Fortunately, a mutation in the battlefield distracted him from this half-resolved issue.
"Detecting numerous FTL transitions!"
"Give me a count!"
"Seven ships have emerged from FTL! Our systems have tentatively identified them as three scout vessels, two transport vessels and two combat carriers. The combat carriers are launching mechs! Their hull markings match the emblem of the 3rd Imodris Legion!"
"Lady Amelia’s bloodhounds! They’re here to stall us while the rest of Lady Amelia’s disposable forces can catch up to us!"
The Vesians didn’t hide their intentions. This small flotilla of seven ships emerged right at the point where the Vandals tried to emerge from the minefield. This added an additional hurdle to their escape plan. The eighty-odd mechs of the Vesian combat carriers would never be able defeat the Vandals, but clever tactics might easily enable them to stall the task force for hours on end.
Trouble continued to pile up on their shoulders!
Ves didn’t need to receive any orders to begin to analyze the Imodris mechs. If the Vandals wanted to fight past the newly emerged force after exiting the minefield, they needed to finish the battle quickly.
The automated system connected to the central database quickly identified the mech profiles to the ones that had recently showed up in the morale-crushing Bentheim raids. "The mechs match the profiles of the 2nd Calico Dancer Bats! They’re a light to medium spaceborn mech regiment!"
The Calico Dancer Bats acted as the scouts, raiders, harassers of the 3rd Imodris Legion. They utilize some of the same designs as the Flagrant Vandals. While the latter fielded more medium and heavy mechs in order to operate independently, the Calico Dancer Bats exclusively focused on light and skinny medium mechs in order to fulfill their niche very well.
Their light mechs all obtained proper development support. Up to a hundred mech designers must have contributed to the refinement of each of their main designs.
All of this bode fairly ill for the Vandals. The Calico Dancer Bats was a proper military mech regiment, while the Flagrant Vandals routinely struggled to pay the bills. The disparity not only touched upon the design quality of their mechs, but also their relative cost.
Ves only needed to take a simple glance to see that the Dancer Bats employed significantly more expensive designs for their mainstay mechs. The Inheritors wouldn’t stand a chance in an even fight.
Their only advantage so far was that the Dancer Bats only arrived with two mech companies! Faced with the five-hundred-or-so spaceborn mechs of the Vandals, the difference in quality wouldn’t make any difference.
Ves conveyed all of his findings to Major Verle, who figured most of this out by himself. He opened a private channel. "The Dancer Bats are true frontline fighters. They have a rich tradition and enjoy ample support from Imodris. Yet worse than the two mech companies is the thought that Lady Amalia and her main force won’t take long to arrive. The fact that they only sent out this light flotilla so far proves that they are confident that their reinforcements can catch up in time."
"Sir, if I may suggest something."
"Go ahead, Mr. Larkinson."
"I believe this minefield, while annoying, poses no threat to us. However, facing the experienced Calico Dancer Bats in a delaying action will only lead to further entanglement that we cannot afford. Their light mechs are faster, deadlier and more durable than our own. Our Inheritors are plainly not up to the task of defeating them all within a short amount of time."
"What is your point?"
"They only sent two companies of light mechs. While our regular mechs will find it very challenging to destroy them fast, it shouldn’t be an issue for Venerable O’Callahan to do so."
Ves put forward the only suggestion that made sense to him. Only an expert pilot could save them from this predicament.
However, Major Verle did not appear to be relieved. "Impossible. O’Callahan will never choose to deploy in this situation."
"Deploying Venerable O’Callahan at this junction is not a good idea." Major Verle responded with uncharacteristic patience. Perhaps Ves had proven himself enough times for Verle to appreciate his help. "There are two major problems with asking the Venerable to fight. He won’t easily rouse himself from his sleep. If he finds out we woke him up just to ask him to take care of some small fries, he’ll immediately quit right after this action."
Ves had hoped that Major Verle would try to convince the Venerable of the necessity of their situation. After all, if the Vandals got stalled long enough for Lady Amalia’s main forces, even an expert pilot wouldn’t be able to escape the calamity that would ensue.
No matter how skilled or fantastic an expert could pilot a mech, it was impossible for them to resist an onslaught of thousands of mechs at a time.
At his current aged and decrepit state, Venerable O’Callahan could only muster a resonance strength of thirty laveres. This figure was around the middle when it came to expert pilots, and would be barely enough to mop up a hundred mechs at once.
The second problem compounded on the first one.
"You know what type of mech our resident expert pilot utilizes, Mr. Larkinson. We distinctly chose to retain him for his ability to deter and restrain opposing expert pilots. Mopping up a swarm of cannon fodder has never been his job description."
Just as regular mech pilots specialized in different types of mechs, so did expert pilots. They continued to hone their skills and newly developed resonance abilities on top of the foundation they built before they advanced.
No expert pilot would choose to switch to piloting a different type of mech. A laser marksman would never dabble with swordsman mechs, while knight mech pilots wouldn’t dream of piloting a skirmisher mech. Such an abrupt switch invalidated at least two-thirds of their hard work and all of their specialties.
Thus, as a rule, an expert pilot stuck to their specialty for the rest of their lives. Though this didn’t bar them from piloting other types of mechs, it was just a massive waste to do so.
The issue concerning the Verle Task Force was that Venerable O’Callahan piloted a mech that excelled in battling elite opponents.
As O’Callahan piloted a lancer mech, he almost exclusively employed charges. His Parallax Star accelerated very quickly, and while it wasn’t very agile, it only needed to connect its lance to an enemy mech for a single instant to demolish it. Ves may not have witnessed it in action, but he’d seen how the hapless mechs unceasingly disintegrated upon getting hit.
This ability to kill with a single charge came at a cost. It took a significant amount of time for the Parallax Star to reorient and build up an unstoppable momentum. Chasing down flighty light mechs one by one was an arduous task even for a lancer mech.
Even worse, light mechs formed something of a counter to the Parallax Star. It loved nothing more than to pierce through a fat, immobile target no matter how much armor they put up. Agile and flitty light mechs had a realistic chance of dodging the tip of the lance as it honed in on them as long as the mech pilots kept their heads cool.
Compared to the only other expert pilot Ves had witnessed at close hand, the difference couldn’t be greater. Ves mingled with the 4th Bentheim Division during the Glowing Planet campaign, where Venerable Stanton Drake piloted an aerial striker called the Fire Drake. With a single charged flamethrower attack, the Fire Drake would easily be able to engulf a closely-packed formation of enemy mechs, vaporizing dozens of them at a time.
Yet even with these disadvantages, Ves still made another attempt. "Sir, I understand your concerns, but this is a good chance to achieve a victory without significant losses. Maybe if he’s alone, Venerable O’Callahan wouldn’t be able to take care of the opposing mechs. However, if we combine his threat with our own mechs, we’ll be able to roll them over through overwhelming force."
An expert pilot backed up by hundreds of regular mechs could split their focus and cover each other’s weaknesses. The regular Vandal mech pilots would be able to tie down the enemy light mechs while O’Callahan demolished their ships.
Without their combat carriers, the enemy mechs became homeless. Their morale would inevitably plunge and they would lose the support and coordination of their officers.
Yet Major Verle shook his head again. "It’s complicated. Maybe it’s time to fill you in. The truth is that we’ve made a deal with Venerable O’Callahan. The man is old and far past his prime. While his body condition isn’t too bad, his lifespan is nearly at an end. Every second is precious to him. The only reason he still manages to live is because his body is put in a state of artificial hibernation. This slows down his aging process and stretches out his remaining lifespan."
"How much time does he have left, sir?"
"A couple of years at most. Mr. Larkinson, you have to realize that no human wishes to die. Especially to former heroes like O’Callahan, the closer they come to death, the more they fear their inevitable end. Those among us who fall in the ranks of elites treasure their lifespan above all else. It is an obsession that drives the likes of O’Callahan and Professor Velten to extremes."
Ves closed his eyes and recalled the old elites he met. Eminent figures such as Lord Kaine, a noble from the Constance Grand Kingdom, and Professor Velten, a Senior Mech Designer, all achieved incredible success in their lives. They climbed on top of may rivals and peers and reached heights that only few could surpass.
Yet despite their abundant wealth, power and achievements, age cared nothing about those matters. Death would come from them whether they were as poor as paupers or as rich as someone from a first-rate superstate.
Ves knew that both of them benefited from at least one round of age-prolonging treatments. This expanded their natural human lifespan by at least a hundred years, allowing them to live at least two-hundred years if nothing happened.
Both of them had also enjoyed a second round of age-prolonging treatments. Ves knew very little about this privilege that was only handed out to the best of the elites, and that the treatments differed in cost, stability and outcomes.
Master Olson didn’t look older than her thirties, and she was over a hundred years old. Everyone could tell that she benefited from at least one round of very high-quality age-prolonging treatments that rejuvenated her body and turned back her biological clock in a fashion.
In contrast, the second round of treatments applied to Lord Kaine and Professor Velten had evidently suffered complications. It was clear to Ves that their treatments hadn’t prolonged their ages at all. As a matter of fact, the opposite happened, and their aging process accelerated several times over.
Such outcomes made it clear to Ves that age-prolonging treatments always came with risks. If even a former patriarch of a noble House of a second-rate state suffered a botched treatment, then it could be seen that the odds of failure was significantly high.
Yet even then, these elites accepted the treatments without reserve. What did this signify?
Nobody wanted to die! Especially not when they had the opportunity to stretch out their lives by another hundred years!
In comparison to Lord Kaine and Professor Velten, Venerable O’Callahan was younger by at least eighty-years, but he looked just as senile and decrepit as the former two elites.
This was the tragic fate of expert pilots who didn’t make the cut. Their brain mutations meant that ordinary age-prolonging treatments didn’t work for them. They needed to undergo a modified treatment that was significantly more expensive and troublesome to arrange.
As much as expert pilots enjoyed the worship of millions or billions of people, their worth ordinarily didn’t merit an expensive treatment.
As callous as it sounded, a state could always nurture more expert pilots over time. They only emerged through happenstance, but with a large enough population base, a state would generally be able to count on a steady trickle of younger expert pilots to replace the older ones who became wracked with age.
The Bright Republic evidently wrote off Venerable O’Callahan as an elite worth investing in. With his peak performance of forty-four laveres at his prime, it was evident that he would never be able to come close to advancing to ace pilot even with hundreds of years of practice. His potential had already been exhausted.
Due to the cost of pilot-compatible age-prolonging treatments, states only prolonged the lives of expert pilots that stood a chance of advancing into ace pilots. As long as their resonance strength didn’t stagnate, they would be deemed as possessing enough potential to continue to grow.
In practice, these expert pilots with a lot of promise ahead of their lives almost never showed up.
The Larkinsons nurtured a decent number of expert pilots since their establishment during the founding of the Bright Republic.
Even then, none had been found worthy of benefiting from age-prolonging treatments.
Nobody except for the Larkinson Ancestor, at least.
In short, the scarcity of lifespan and everyone’s demand for extending it was a natural human obsession. Venerable O’Callahan couldn’t be moved by threats or enticements. Money held no value for him, and even the prospect of piloting a better mech wouldn’t excite him very much.
The only factor that could make him move was when it concerned his life.
O’Callahan would fight if the Vandals risked annihilation, because he stood to lose his life as well if the Vandals lost all of their mechs and ships. Besides that, he would only move if someone offered him some additional life.
"Everytime O’Callahan wakes up, his remaining lifespan diminishes at a faster rate than when he slumbers. This cost is magnified when he pilots the Parallax Star into battle. The stress and exertion accelerates his aging by a month in a lengthy battle. Do you understand, Mr. Larkinson?"
Ves reluctantly nodded. "I understand, sir. Chasing down two companies worth of light mechs is not cost-effective in the Venerable’s perspective."
In other words, the gains they made from his deployment didn’t match the cost of his decreasing lifespan. Venerable O’Callahan would likely demand a ruinous price from the Vandals if he was forced to follow the plan proposed by Ves.
"That still leaves us with little options." Ves said, resigned to the idea that they wouldn’t be able to borrow Venerable O’Callahan’s power. "The two companies from the Calico Dancer Bats can run rings around us. Their light mechs are so fast, I’m not even sure our Inheritor mechs are able to catch up."
"You’re not alone in your concerns, Mr. Larkinson. However, don’t forget that you are not alone. We’ll figure something out, or we won’t be able to call ourselves the Flagrant Vandals. Trust in our officers."
With that, the major closed the channel and shifted his attention to other matters. The problem concerning the Vesian reinforcements didn’t need to be addressed until they exited the minefield, which should still be a couple of hours away.
Still, the seven ships that arrived first might just be the vanguard of what would come. Ves figured that the Calico Dancer Bats split up their companies to cover several star systems in order to insure they had enough spread to catch the fleeing Vandals.
It would take some time for those split elements to converge on this star system, but it wouldn’t take more than a day for the Dancer Bats present in the neighboring systems to arrive.
"There’s not enough time. If a second wave of reinforcements decide to tangle with us, we’ll be tied down for days. That’s enough for at least half of the 3rd Imodris Legion to arrive and cut off our escape."
An alert sounded out in the command center just as the task force was about to emerge past the minefield. The mines turned out to be a slightly modified version with shorter reach in exchange for a reduction in cost. This was why the 3rd Imodris Legion hadn’t hesitated in laying down millions of mines.
Ves didn’t recognize the alert, but most of the officers looked up in alarm.
"The Finmoth Regal is reporting internal damage! Explosions have set off in one of her hangar bays and engineering. Her thrusters have lots propulsion!"
The Finmoth Regal! That was the ship where the two suspicious Inheritor mechs came from. After Ves identified the strangeness in Nemo McAllister and the other pilot’s mechs and passed it on, Major Verle immediately tasked the security department to pick up the thread.
No matter what, a hidden and unauthorized transmission device represented a profound betrayal to the Vandals!
"Give me a sitrep! Why is the Finmoth Regal losing propulsion?!"
"Sir, the security department has attempted to apprehend the three mech technicians that have serviced the suspect mechs. When the mech technicians at the hangar saw the approaching officers, they panicked and self-destructed. The hidden explosives on their bodies killed the security officers along with several other mech technicians! In addition, another explosion went off at engineering that killed two junior engineers and heavily damaged the engines!"
"The Finmoth Regal has stopped accelerating! She’s falling behind!" Another operator warned.
Major Verle clenched his fist but maintained control. "Command the Antecedent and the Gorgon’s Gaze to hook the Finmoth Regal and drag her out of this minefield! Tell the Regal to get her engines back online!"
The ships adjusted their formation as the Antecedent and Gorgon’s Gaze drifted in front of the faltering Finmoth Regal. Major Verle deliberately picked out these two combat carriers because they possessed some of the more powerful engines among the ships in the task force.
After aligning themselves in a triangle, hatches opened up from the rear of the two carriers. Thick but flexible alloy cables shot out from the openings and latched onto specialised slots embedded along the exterior of the Finmoth Regal.
Once Regal secured the cables through various means, the two ships in front increased the power to their engines and thrusters. In truth, every ship in the task force matched their speeds with the slowest ships in the fleet. In this case, the fat, lumbering logistics ships weighed them all down.
However, this also served as a benefit in their current circumstances as the powerful combat carriers never engaged their sublight engines to full capacity. Right now, the Antecedent and Gorgon’s Gaze almost managed to catch up to the rest of the fleet even as they towed the entire weight of the Finmoth Regal.
Major Verle ordered his other ships to match their pace to the acceleration of the towing combination. This extended the time they would be able to escape, but no one disagreed with the choice. They didn’t want to leave anyone behind.
Ves had seen towing actions like this before. Evidently, towing happened often enough for the ships of the Vandals to incorporate a standardized system of cable launchers and attachment points.
"Thank heavens we aren’t slowed down too much."
Besides him, Iris nodded in relief as well. "The combat carriers are very powerful. If not for the need to accompany and shield the supporting vessels, we could have raced out of this minefield hours ago."
Certainly, the one course of action everyone had in mind was to evacuate and abandon the transports and logistics ships. Taking none but the extra crew, the unburdened combat carriers would be able to depart from this star system with significant haste.
The only problem was that they would lose virtually all of their gains from the Detemen System, as well as make their supply crunch worse. Verle couldn’t afford to destroy their long-term hopes by pursuing a drastic short-term benefit.
After the immediate problem was dealt with, Major Verle directly called the chief security officer that presided over Finmoth Regal.
"Explain to me why your ship has blown up from the insides! Is every threat taken care of or is there still an ongoing crisis?"
Against Verle’s pressing questions, the chief security officer looked haggard and not at all prepared.
"We’re still surveying the damage. Several fires have broken out that we are in the process of putting out. One of our hangar bays is completely locked down while the other ones are paralyzed due to fears of other bombs. We are sweeping the Finmoth Regal back and forth but it will take at least an hour to scour every nook and cranny. Even then, I’m afraid we won’t be able to catch everything, sir."
"I don’t care about that! How long do you need to get the engines back to work?!"
"Sir! The chief engineer has told me that the damage is limited but precise. Key components need to be fabricated on the spot, while the damaged engines need to be disassembled and reassembled almost completely. The shortest time frame our engineers can give is four hours."
Four hours was a long time to go for the task force to traverse. Major Verle heavily depended on the acceleration of the ships under his command to shrug off their pursuers.
As long as they possessed enough speed, they could outrun every opponent and transition back to FTL where they would be safe!
"If it speeds up the repairs, don’t hesitate to borrow additional engineers from our other ships! Every second that the Regal is immobile will only delay our departure further!"
"U-U-Understood, major! We will get on it and restore the engines as quickly as possible!"
That was the best they could hope for. Like any ship component, their engines converted an enormous amount of power to propel the vessels forward. They served different purposes from mech engines, and all of them looked huge and imposing in many ways.
Ves knew that damaging a critical part such as the engines of a ship needed a lot of time to resolve. Their size added a lot of complexity to their workings. While that made the engines more powerful or flexible, it also made it harder to get around their dimensions and weight when they needed to repair or service them. Repairing damaged ship engines within four hours already sounded like a stretch.
Fortunately, a ship didn’t require any working sublight engines to transition into FTL.
Ships traversed through the higher dimensions through some esoteric means via their FTL drives. The principles involved were exceedingly complex and not something that Ves would ever understand. He only knew the bare basics that was taught to any school child.
In any case, they hadn’t fallen into despair yet. A ship could lose its sublight engines, but it could never afford to lose their FTL drives.
The FTL drive and power reactor therefore enjoyed the highest level of protection. They would be much harder to tamper with compared a slightly less important component such as the engines.
No matter how Ves looked at it, the suspect mechs and the three suspicious mech technicians shouldn’t have led to catastrophic damage to the Finmoth Regal.
"Did everyone let down their guard or something? That chief security officer doesn’t inspire much confidence."
"That’s how it is with the Vandals." Iris remarked. "They receive way more incompetents than any other mech regiment of the Mech Corps. It shouldn’t be a surprise that the ranks are rife with incompetents. Positions still need to be filled even if there is no one suitable to take the place. I would argue that your temporary field promotion is out of helplessness as well. They wouldn’t have chosen to promote you to head designer."
Ves couldn’t refute her words, especially since he directly benefited from it. Still, Ves inwardly complained about the lack of competence and professionalism around the Flagrant Vandals. The mech regiment’s inherent nature forced them to accept subpar recruits even if they wished to kick them away.
The entire mech regiment still needed running somehow! If the Vandals constantly tilted up their noses and arrogantly rejected most of the people they received, they would quickly lose their strength and reputation.
Ves tried to dig in more at what happened at the Regal. The latest updates on the internal network suggested that the Regal’s security officers had already flagged the three mech technicians as people that warranted extra attention.
Somehow, the security contingent aboard the Regal never followed up on the early warnings. The alert notices got lost in the system and became forgotten, all the while the trio started to scavenge and cobble up something together during their off-hours.
Naturally, the incompetent security officers of the Finmoth Regal only found out about the latter after the explosions occurred.
The issue didn’t appear to be so simple. An average mech technician would never be allowed to enter the hangar bay. It was off-limits to anyone except ship crew that needed to be there for some reason.
"Are the mech technicians really spies, or did they have something else in store for us?
The most obvious signs pointed towards a straightforward infiltration by pirates. His overactive imagination blanked out for a bit as he considered various alternatives. Yet without any proof, it was useless to speculate.
In the end, this incident only served as a distraction for the main event. If nothing else, the sudden sabotage prompted every other ship in the fleet to double-check their critical sections for similar signs of sabotage.
This was mainly a concern for the ship officers. The mech officers on the other hand urged some of their squads to return to the hangar bays and replenish their supplies before going back out again.
Within minutes, the mechs would shift their priorities from shooting down mines to taking down the Calico Dancer Bats. The coming engagement was a critical one where the Vandals needed to escape the entanglement of the Vesian light mech regiment.
Ves felt regretful that he hadn’t come up with any clever tactics or any other tricks that could land them an easy victory. The Dancer Bats were simply too well-funded to field mechs with numerous vulnerabilities.
On the face of it, the entire match-up seemed ridiculous. How could eighty light mechs contend against a force of over five-hundred spaceborn mechs?
"The answer is speed, or rather distance."
The flotilla from Imodris split up in two. The corvettes nimbly spread out to serve as additional eyes on the battlefield while the lumbering transports escaped before they could be targeted.
Only the combat carriers mattered. They possessed slightly better specs than the combat carriers fielded by the Vandals. Even when it concerned their combat carriers, the Calico Dancer Bats never stopped prioritizing their speed!
This absolute suppression of speed gave the Vesian mech regiment ample confidence in preventing their prey from escaping. The only thing they needed to do to prevent the Flagrant Vandals from escaping into FTL was to throw a bunch of gravitic mines at them. These didn’t need to be expensive or all that powerful. If they brought enough gravitic mines, they could even drag it out for several days.
Ves looked depressed when the Vandals hadn’t managed to come up with another solution besides a risky one he happened to disagree with. The only way to overcome the acceleration gap was to overload their fastest mechs, which in their case happened to be the Inheritor mechs.
He couldn’t help but warn Major Verle of the consequences of his decision. "Those mechs will be ruined after an hour or more of fighting. Even if they can end the battle faster, they’ll need extensive servicing to bring them back to a usable condition."
"At this stage, we don’t have any other choice. The only way we can satisfy our thirst is to drink poison. Considering our options, overloading the Inheritor mechs is less lethal than any other poisons we can opt for. It should be sufficient to overload a hundred of them for a start."
The time for battle arrived. Though the Flagrant Vandals already spent hours reducing the space mines homing in on them, they posed a nuisance at best.
In the eyes of mech pilots, only other mechs could threaten mechs.
The 2nd Calico Dancer Bats of the 3rd Imodris Division enjoyed a rich martial tradition.
The martial tradition of a mech regiment formed the core of their identity and strength. Measured in years, they served as a convenient measuring stick to compare to other mech regiments.
The Flagrant Vandals had only been founded less than two generations ago. With less than sixty years of development since their founding, they built up an adequate but lackluster martial tradition.
As for the Calico Dancer Bats, their founding was several hundred years ago. Entire generations had been raised to serve in the Dancer Bats. Some mech pilots could even point back to their parents, grandparents, great-grandparents and so-on as generational Dancer Bats.
Over hundreds of years, the Dancer Bats evolved into a unique mech regiment that was truly unique in the galaxy. With a rich culture and strong camaraderie, their willpower was practically unbreakable. No matter how badly a battle progressed, they never faltered in the line of duty. They fled only when ordered to and they wouldn’t hesitate to fight to the last man if the stakes were high.
Their rich martial tradition not only strengthened their belief, they also refined their battle methods. With their abundantly-staffed design teams, they designed the most optimized mechs for the roles the Calico Dancer Bats demanded out of their mechs. Over many decades, they practiced, tested, and revised their tactics and strategies with their unique mech models until they honed themselves into a razor sharp killing machine.
The Calico Dancer Bats nominally consisted of a spaceborn light regiment, but that belied their ferocity in battle.
Some light regiments exclusively dealt with reconnaissance, harassment, stealth and anti-stealth warfare. Such regiments acted as support for the heavier regiments that did all of the fighting.
The Calico Dancer Bats didn’t believe in letting other mech regiments do the fighting in their stead. While they often fulfilled support roles, more often than not they sought to enter the fray in earnest. This earned them a lot of renown over the years as a true battle regiment.
The Vesian regiment’s rich tradition and exemplary battle record weighed down heavily upon the Flagrant Vandals. They hadn’t even clashed yet, but already most mech pilots started to feel suppressed.
It was ridiculous, but over five-hundred mech pilots felt apprehensive about going into battle against a meager force of eighty Calico Dancer Bats.
That was because the Dancer Bats embodied their name in battle. They developed exquisite tactics and routines that allowed their light mechs to pose a serious threat against a larger but clumsier force. Their favorite tactic was to disperse into a chaotic sphere around a slower group of mechs and pelt them endlessly with their light submachine guns.
Though the Dancer Bats wouldn’t be able to deal much damage at the start, neither could the enemies do anything to the annoying circlers. The Bats were too hard to hit with ranged weapons and they were too fast to be caught by melee mechs. Their marksmanship with their famous submachine guns wasn’t too shabby either.
Ves had quickly read up on these facts from the intelligence section of the central database. As their mortal enemies, the Bright Republic possessed a good understanding of each Vesian mech regiment, especially one that showed up often during every Bright-Vesia War.
"The difference between the Calico Dancer Bats and the Flagrant Vandals is too big." Ves spoke softly.
Iris nodded in agreement. "The Calico Dancer Bats are one of the premier light mech regiments from the Imodris Duchy. Their mech pilots throw themselves into battle without hesitation. That’s not so unusual, but the remarkable thing about them is that they are crafty in battle. They always manage to survive or turn around a bad situation. Their adaptability is their strongest trait."
Perhaps the Calico Dancer Bats wouldn’t be as good in raiding ships and facilities as the Flagrant Vandals, but when it came to large-scale mech brawls, the Vesians would feel right at home.
In this situation where the Vandals almost lost heart even before the battle had begun, Major Verle stood up and activated a fleet-wide broadcast. Every serviceman halted their work as projections of their commanding officer emerged in the middle of each compartment.
"Vandals. We stand at the precipice of annihilation. I won’t mince words with you. If we don’t depart from this star system in the next hour, we might never be able to leave forever. Standing in our way are the fine warriors of the Calico Dancer Bats. They are but eighty active fighters among them. Will we allow ourselves to be disgraced by an outnumbered force?"
"No!"
Indignation swelled among the Vandals.
"The Calico Dancer Bats are formidable, but so are we! With our numbers and our grit, it’s impossible for the Dancer Bats to overcome us! Don’t be fooled by their reputation, their mechs are just as vulnerable as ours! There is nothing to fear from them, because they are but an egg trying to smash against a rock! Believe in yourself and believe in your comrades! Remember who you are! We are the Flagrant Vandals! We take what is ours!"
"We take what is ours!"
Major Verle didn’t let his speech go on forever. The mech pilots only needed a slight reminder to regain their confidence.
Ves witnessed as the various mechs finished their resupply. By now, most of the mines had lost most of their fuel. They only retained a fraction in the case the minelayers returned to retrieve them. In any case, the mines had done their job. The initial strikes peeled away a significant amount of armor from several combat carriers while the rest had rattled the Vandals and exhausted some of their stamina.
Thus, the Vandals deploying into battle at this moment weren’t fresh anymore. Though they had been trained to endure adverse conditions, their readiness couldn’t compare to the eighty Calico Dancer Bats that stood in opposition.
Their pristine mechs split up in two companies and awaited the arrival of their adversaries. In any case, the Vandals needed to take the initiative, leaving the Dancer Bats free to react whenever they wanted.
Against the menacing burgundy and black Vandal mechs, the mechs of the Calico Dancer Bats coated their mechs in their namesake calico-colored pattern. On their left chest, they bore the emblem of their mech regiment, which depicted a stylization of a cheeky calico-colored bat.
The two companies employed two different mech models in equal proportions. They consisted of a submachine gun-wielding skirmisher mech and a longer-ranged frontline spaceborn mech. Ves already read the details on their designs. The former was called the Pinprick and the latter became known as the Brain Scrambler.
Both the Pinprick and the Brain Scrambler served as the mainstay mechs of the Calico Dancer Bats. They hadn’t brought any other models along, but the two that showed up so far enabled them to employ plenty of tactics already.
If the Flagrant Vandals couldn’t overcome a force that deployed their two lightest and cheapest mechs, then they might as well disband their regiment on the spot.
Compared to the cohesion and uniformity of the ranks of the Dancer Bats, the Vandals appeared a lot shabbier despite fielding over three-hundred spaceborn mechs.
Major Verle decided to throw almost all of the Inheritor mechs at his disposal as well as some frontline mechs of their own to chase after the enemy mechs. Meanwhile, he would put their slower mechs on reserve, which included the Hellcat hybrid knights.
He was rather helpless in this decision because the mechs and combat carriers of the Calico Dancer Bats were all capable of swift acceleration. They could both outpace the Inheritors in ordinary circumstances.
Unfortunately for them, this wasn’t a regular circumstance.
"Sir, the Inheritors are ready to be deployed."
"Send them in! Follow the plan and don’t overload too early."
A sweeping number of Inheritors and a smaller group of frontline mechs that provided ranged support accelerated away from the task force. They started to close the gap to the Calico Dancer Bats and would eventually bridge the entire gap in fifteen minutes.
The Bats didn’t want to get caught so early, so they immediately increased their propulsion to match the pace of their pursuers.
Naturally, they also didn’t forget their primary duties. Their long-ranged mechs occasionally fired long-range laser beams at the Vandal ships. The attacks dealt little damage against the armored prow of the combat carriers, but nobody felt good about being pelted all day.
The Vandals replied with at least double the number of laser beams. However, their level of marksmanship was much lower, so they missed more often than not. They focused most of their fire against the enemy combat carriers, but the ships waded through the laser grids like graceful dolphins.
The few laser beams that scorched their exterior hardly affected any section of armor.
This was just an appetizer for both forces. Nobody took these errant laser beams seriously. What mattered more was whether the Vandals would be able to catch up with the fleeing Calico Dancer Bats.
Their reputation was not for show. As soon as it appeared the Vandals inched closer with each passing second, the ships and mechs and the Dancer Bats accelerated at full power. The distance widened yet again.
In these circumstances, the Inheritor mechs had no choice but to overload their power reactor and flight systems in order to have any chance of catching up.
Every minute they overloaded their systems, the affected components suffered months worth of wear and tear. Fighting for an hour at this level would already be a commendable feat.
They needed to finish this in half an hour or less. Otherwise, the Inheritor mechs would degrade up to the point where they became total write-offs after the battle.
The Vandals couldn’t push their Inheritor mechs too much. They still needed them in subsequent battles.
With that in mind, Ves minutely calculated the most optimal overload level to push their systems. Too little, and the speed boost was too marginal. Too much, and the mechs wouldn’t be able to last the entire battle.
Because the mechs hadn’t received any significant modifications to accommodate such abuse, Ves had been forced to pick a somewhat conservative overload level of twenty percent. This basically meant the mechs performed twenty percent better in certain areas.
With the sudden twenty percent speed boost, the Inheritors suddenly appeared capable enough to catch up to the Calico Dancer Bats.
This definitely surprised the Vesians. Several minutes went by as the Vandals waited for how their enemy would respond. Would they overload their systems as well to drag out this chase?
"What are the odds they will choose to overload their systems?" Iris asked Ves.
He shrugged. "How would I know? I’m not too familiar with the Calico Dancer Bats. If they want to fulfill their mission, they should choose to reciprocate. However, unlike us, they not only need to overload their mechs, but also their combat carriers. I can tell you that the consequences of overloading the propulsion of a combat carrier is no laughing matter."
The bigger and more complex propulsion systems of these robust vessels granted them greater leeway in overloading their systems, but the expensive was also ruinous. In addition, anything that could go wrong might blow up an entire ship. Thus, the Dancer Bats needed to decide whether to continue to stay out of reach or counterattack in order to preserve their carriers.
In the end, the Dancer Bats continued to flee without adjusting their current course. They chose to stall for time but preserve the integrity of their mechs.
"Looks like we won this first round." Ves sighed. He silently applauded Major Verle for being able to pressure the Dancer Bats without inflicting too much damage. "It looks like the Dancer Bats are too arrogant. For an aggressive mech regiment like theirs, fleeing to the point of overloading their systems is probably a step too far. They would rather let us catch up to them in order to beat us down."
Soon, enough time passed for the Inheritors to enter into engagement range to the two Vesian combat carriers.
Ves kept an eye on the telemetry of a sample of Inheritors throughout the ordeal. He watched carefully for anomalies and other dangerous signs.
Several times, he detected latent dangers such as an excessive buildup of heat in one section or a weakening of the power draw in another section.
He was quite good at detecting these kinds of dangers. Each time he spotted something worrisome, he came up with a solution and sent the entire package to the mech pilot.
Naturally, every mech pilot that read the message attached to the setting tweaks couldn’t understand a thing of what Ves proposed. All of the jargon and technical numbers looked like a maze to these brutes.
What, did you think mech pilots studied advanced calculus or engineering in the academies?
None of the pilots understood his tweaks, but since they came from the head designer, they all accepted them without too much consideration. After all, the head designer was the most knowledgeable mech specialist among them. Their belief in his capabilities was naively high.
These on-the-fly adjustments compensated for the quick and dirty last-minute modifications made to the Inheritors.
Throughout the time the task force waded through the minefield, Ves ordered the mech designers to supervise a frantic modification of the Inheritor mechs in order to squeeze more speed out of their skinny frames.
The suddenness of the Vesian ambush and the shortage of time precluded any major overhauls.
"If only we had a week’s worth of warning." He sighed in the command center of the Shield of Hispania. "With that much time, our mech designers and mech technicians could have bolstered the internals of those Inheritors to withstand the overload."
Iris smiled ruefully at him next to his seat. "You can’t predict anything in war. Events never progress the way we want to, because Lady Luck and our opponents are playing the same game as us. Be thankful that we are only facing two mech companies. This is far from our worst-case scenario."
The worst-case scenario would be getting cornered by an entire Mech Legion. There could be no escape if the famous Lady Amalia managed to throw all the mechs at her disposal at them. Even the arrival of two additional mech regiment cut down their chances of escape by ninety percent.
The Flagrant Vandals needed to mop up the two companies in record time in order to avoid more complications.
Ves was relieved to see that the overloaded Inheritors held themselves together so far. In order to speed them up even further, he enacted some modifications that didn’t take much time to implement.
The mech technicians worked around the clock to complete these modifications. They deployed with only half of their energy cells, which saved them a fair amount of mass at the cost of halving their uptime. They also stripped various other components that wouldn’t be needed in the coming battle.
Considering that they needed to finish this battle quickly, Major Verle approved of the changes. Fighting a lengthy engagement was no different from getting annihilated, so they needed to pull all the stops.
All of that sacrifice served their purpose. The Inheritors inexorably caught up to the Pinpricks and Brain Scramblers. Both of the latter mechs primarily relied on ranged weaponry, so the Vesians attacked first.
As their model name suggested, the Pinpricks didn’t deal much damage. Their submachine guns fired light caliber ballistic shells at a rapid rate of fire. Nevertheless, they carried a fairly high amount of ammunition, so they could keep up their harassment for a fairly lengthy time.
Compared to laser weapons of the same power and capacity, ballistic weapons had the edge in lethality. The Pinpricks weren’t meant to last forever in a battle of attrition. Their designers only opted for ballistic submachine guns because a laser weapon version simply possessed too little threat.
One of the downsides of the submachine gun was that it wasn’t very accurate at long ranges. The Pinpricks needed to wait until the Inheritors came into medium range before they had a chance of hitting them. Even then, the inherent inaccuracy of the weapons and their awkward postures due to the chase didn’t allow them to hit the Inheritors very often.
Still, even if they got hit a couple of times, the Inheritor mechs couldn’t handle too much damage. They were light mechs after all, and many people likened their armor to fabric rather than plates of alloy.
If not for the extremely light payloads of the submachine gun shells, the Inheritors would have been forced to turn away after suffering a couple of hits at the same section.
As for now, they could probably endure half a magazine, but no more. The Inheritor mechs didn’t allow their opponents the luxury to aim at the same spots. They dodged and weaved even as they continued to close the distance.
The only mechs they needed to be wary of was the Brain Scrambler. As the spaceborn frontline mechs of the Calico Dancer Bats, the Brain Scrambler served as their medium to long-ranged fire support.
Frontline mechs stripped everything that wasn’t essential to a mech to minimize their production cost and complexity of piloting them. The Brain Scrambler resembled a spacecraft more than a mech as it resembled an armed shuttle with gun barrels for arms more than some humanoid or bestial creation.
In truth, calling it a mech at all would be stretching it, as it completely lacked a pair of legs and a head. Everything except its weapon was embedded into their center body.
The only reason why people called such spaceborn crafts a mech rather than a fighter was because it needed a mech pilot to interface with the machine. Of course, due to lacking all of those complicated limbs, even the most untalented pilots could make a contribution with these simple mechs.
Replacing their humanoid arms with rotating gun barrels might have reduced their flexibility to a low point, but it gave them a considerable amount of firepower.
The worst thing about the Brain Scramblers was that they fired higher caliber high-explosive shells. Though they couldn’t carry a lot of ammunition for that reason, their threat level was much higher despite being much less valuable than the Pinpricks.
"Boss, why are they called the Brain Scramblers?" Iris asked.
"The Brain Scramblers are mostly employed in large numbers and in pitched battles on the frontlines. Their purpose isn’t necessarily to kill their targets. Instead, they’re meant to disrupt heavily armored mechs by rattling them with constant explosions."
"Is that why they run out of shells so fast?"
"Yeah. Their shells are heavier than what light mechs ought to fire, so the trade off is fairly serious. They won’t be able to sustain this bombardment for very long."
A dozen Inheritors already fell through focused fire. The Brain Scramblers didn’t scatter their fire over hundreds of targets and instead concentrated their fire on a handful of unlucky Inheritors. Dozens of miniature cannon shells bombarded a small box around their position.
The Brain Scrambler’s advanced targeting systems did most of the targeting for the mech pilots. They linked up with each other and consistently targeted a small area around an Inheritor, which insured it would get hit no matter where it tried to dodge.
Through this tactic, they steadily reduced the Inheritors arrayed against them, though their ammunition stores also dwindled quickly. The Vandals suffered badly from this round of fire as the Inheritors didn’t even bring their backup pistols to retaliate. The extra weight, however miniscule, would detrimentally affect their speed.
The only mitigating factor about the unilateral exchange of fire was that not a lot of pilots actually died. Though the Brain Scramblers possessed a fair amount of firepower, they were light mechs in the end, so their shells weren’t immediately lethal to the Inheritors upon impact. Many Inheritors simply dropped out of the chase as their core components malfunctions. Other mechs ejected their cockpits in time as their mechs started to show signs of breaking up.
The fallen mechs and ejected cockpits would be picked up later on by the task force as they trailed the chase.
Sometime later, the Brain Scramblers expended most of their reserves. They started to reduce their firing rate by a drastic amount. The Calico Dancer Bats wanted them to remain relevant, so they started to stretch out whatever ammunition they had left.
The cost to the Vandals was fairly grievous. Over fifty Inheritors either turned to scrap or sustained too much damage to continue the chase. Ves practically bled from his heart when he calculated the cost of restoring and replacing them in his head.
Even if the Inheritor mechs was one of their cheapest mech models, the nominal cost to replenish those mechs could easily reach a billion credits, and that only applied to normal market conditions.
In their current condition where they needed to scavenge for resources or get ripped off by trading them at vastly inflated prices, the effective cost was several times higher!
"Waging war is like throwing money into a gluttonous black hole! There’s hardly any profit to be made!"
This was good news for mech manufacturers that supplied the mechs to the military. More fighting meant more mechs got wrecked. More losses meant a higher demand for replacement. Although the LMC wasn’t worthy enough to partner with any mech regiment, even the private sector would sustain heavily losses during the war.
If they managed to survive these turbulent times, Ves figured that his company would be able to make a killing in sales.
With roughly a hundred-and-fifty Inheritors remaining in the vanguard wave, they finally came close enough to threaten the Dancer Bat mechs. Every aggrieved Vandal mech pilot must be grinning right now as their mechs brandished their twin knives.
Major Verle issued a command. "Double Chevron Assault!"
The Inheritors immediately formed into double squad-sized chevrons that were two files deep. There was a fair amount of distance between the forward chevron and the rear chevron. For what purpose, Ves didn’t know.
In any case, this tactic appeared to be more than a simple charge. As soon as every Inheritor took their places, they collectively raised their overload from twenty percent to thirty percent!
Ves almost stood up when that happened! The internal damage sustained by those light mechs was at least twice as much now that they endured an additional ten percent strain!
Nobody told him that the Vandals would do something like this! If Ves knew what they intended to do, he would have been firmer in his warnings!
Although an additional ten percent overload didn’t sound like much, it supercharged the Inheritors. With the extra bump in speed and power, the chevron formations rapidly surged towards the Pinpricks that had been firing their submachine guns at the Vandals in a leisurely fashion.
The sudden acceleration came as a shock to the Calico Dancer Bats, but true to their rich tradition, they didn’t panic. It took only a second for their commanding officers to reassert command.
Towards the incoming chevrons, the Calico Dancer Bats didn’t choose to take them head-on. After all, the Brain Scramblers possessed no melee capability at all while the Pinpricks only treated their knives as a secondary weapon.
Their response appeared soon enough. The two companies split up into two. One angled upwards and the other angled downwards. They didn’t separate too far, only enough before the chance of friendly fire became too great.
"What is this formation?" Ves asked. "It kind of looks like..."
"A hamburger." Iris finished for him. Though it looked comical, neither of them were in the mood to laugh. "It’s the famous Hamburger Chaotic Bat Formation. It’s a variant of their signature Chaotic Bat Formation, the one where they circle around their targets while pelting them with their SMGs. The hamburger variant is more suitable against larger formations."
True to form, the chevrons started to scatter in various directions as the hamburger buns that made up the Dancer Bat mechs tried to turn them into their meat patty.
Both sides pretty much lost their cohesion. The Double Chevron Assault never came into play, but the Dancer Bats didn’t manage to sandwich the Vandals either.
The battle quickly devolved into a chaotic mass dogfight.
Ves initially thought that the Inheritor mechs should have the advantage in such a confusing melee, but Iris quickly disabused his notion.
"The Calico Dancer Bats are sometimes known as the Chaotic Dancer Bats. Don’t think that they’re at a disadvantage right now. The battle has just begun!"
Humans used mechs as war machines. It sounded simple, but in the Age of Mechs, they became ubiquitous. For various reasons, regulations on owning a machine that could wipe out an entire town in a handful of minutes was fairly lax. Anyone decent enough and with the right paperwork could own one.
These days, much more mechs circulated on the market than in the military. Of course, the former couldn’t compare to the latter in quality. Nevertheless, when it came to earning money, the private sector was the way to go.
Institutions that taught mech design groomed their students for the private market. Some did a better job than others, but the starting point was always focused on preparing future mech designers to the harsh realities of trying to compete in a cutthroat market.
This inevitably biased his studies and practical experience towards private sector mechs. He learned all about how to market his product and what he needed to pay attention to in order to maximize its sales.
Ves thought that knowing how to design a private sector mech was enough to encompass almost every standard mech variation. No matter how esoteric their design turned out to be, the fundamental goal was to turn a profit.
The battle currently raging a fair distance away from the ships of the task force turned his conception upside-down. Though he already experienced the humongous battles on land and in space at the Glowing Planet campaign, the scale was just too massive for Ves to relate. He also worried about other priorities back then. Now, he realized that he missed a lot of opportunities.
Perhaps because he was invested in the Flagrant Vandals and the Inheritor model, Ves cared a lot more about how mechs actually fought.
Mechs meant for the private market mostly relied on their individual characteristics as their selling points. Their performance, the quality of their materials and the technologies incorporated into them served as the fundamental measuring stick for their ultimate value.
When Ves initially began to take up his new duties with the Flagrant Vandals, he needed to readjust his commercial mindset a little bit. He couldn’t help but look at every element of a design and make a mental calculation of their cost and price to performance ratio.
Not every mech designer looked at mechs in this light, especially the careerists. While they certainly needed to deal with budgets and other constraints, they only followed the rules because they’d been told to by their superiors, not because of an individual need to minimize their expenses.
In the end, the military and commercial mech industries differed too much.
The current battle between the fastest Vandal mechs and the Dancer Bat mechs revealed that mech battles revolved around more than just the raw performance of the mechs.
Formations played a significant role as well.
Mechs meant for the private market often ended up in the hands of mercenary corps and company forces. The mech pilots employed by these outfits only had a tenuous grasp on discipline, and their coordination was primitive at best.
Two private sector outfits going at each other resembled more of a street brawl than a proper battle.
Thus, Ves never had a proper introduction in the use of formations up to now.
The Calico Dancer Bats responded with the so-called Hamburger Chaotic Bat Formation. In this formation, the Brain Scramblers took a backseat due to their depleted ammunition, but the swift and agile Pinpricks picked up the slack.
Despite being outnumbered by the enemy, the Dancer Bats largely held on. It looked kind of silly to Ves. He even had a misconception of an oversized meat patty being sandwiched by two overly thin buns. The bread should have broken apart, but in fact they continued to pressure the somewhat constrained hamburger patty.
"Do you see, boss?" Iris noted. As a Vesian rebel, her understanding of the Vesian mech models surpassed his own. She knew the famous mech regiments such as the Calico Dancer Bats like the back of her hand. "The Dancer Bats thrive on chaos. It’s what they’ve made for. Right now, we’re losing our Inheritors at a rate to three-to-one."
Certainly, the performance of the Inheritors in this melee was frankly abysmal. The Calico Dancer Bats simply schooled them with the use of a particularly annoying sub-formation called the Batwing Ribbon Cutter.
Half-squads of five Pinpricks formed in a single file and looped around a single target. Each of them roughly followed the same trajectory and fired at the same target in a single instant, which almost always guaranteed a Vandal mech going down.
The Vandals switched up their own formation in response. Thankfully to Ves, the pilots pulled their Inheritors back from their overloaded state now that they didn’t have to catch up anymore.
The Vandals employed the so-called Hungry Crow Attack, a formation that resembled the Batwing Ribbon Cutter but had been adjusted for melee mechs.
The Inheritors picked out a single target and dove at it in quick succession. The expectation here was that their target would definitely block or evade the knife attacks of the lead mech.
The second Inheritor followed up on the initial attack and stood a higher chance of inflicting damage. Even then, if their target still managed to get away, it should have certainly become more rattled. If the second Inheritor couldn’t leave a mark, the third, fourth or fifth mechs all got their own opportunities.
Like annoying crows pecking at an increasingly feeble body, the Inheritors managed to take out more and more Pinprick mechs.
This tipped the balance in their favor. Even if the Vandals lost more mechs at the start, the Calico Dancer Bats only came with eighty mechs. Each mech that got wrecked weighed much heavier on them because it tilted the balance of power disproportionately to their enemies.
"The Calico Dancer Bats have done a lot of damage, but they’re done for now. I’m impressed with their battle grit, but they’ve bitten off way more than they could chew." Ves guessed. "Their combat carriers are being threatened by our second wave of mechs."
While the Inheritor mechs kept the Pinpricks and Brain Scramblers busy, the Vandals also sent out a second wave of mechs to pursue the combat carriers that carried the Vesian mechs into this star system. Though the Hellcats and other spaceborn mechs of the Vandals couldn’t quite catch up to the enemy combat carriers, just chasing it was enough of a threat.
As the battle progressed, Ves saw that the Flagrant Vandals got better at dismantling their opposition. Their early successes boosted their faltering morale and with the numbers growing ever greater in their favor, they began to crush the Calico Dancer Bats in numbers.
Naturally, the Bats didn’t take this lightly and started to improve and adjust their tactics and formations. They started to get used to the fighting style of the Vandals and prevented a complete collapse.
Still, as much as both sides suffered, they couldn’t let this battle of attrition go on. The Pinpricks simply didn’t have the numbers to annihilate the quick and agile Inheritors anymore. In order to take down a single Inheritor, a half-squad needed to use up several magazines each just to strip away the surface armor have a decent shot of hitting something critical.
Thus, as the Calico Dancer Bats declined to about fifty mechs, the previously lackluster Brain Scramblers simultaneously fired shells in the middle of the melee that quickly exploded into massive particle clouds that acted as obscuring smoke.
"The Calico Dancer Bats are pulling back! Both their mechs and combat carriers are overloading their flight systems!"
By letting the Flagrant Vandals close the gap, they let themselves be crushed by overwhelming numbers. The Calico Dancer Bats evidently hadn’t been ordered to fight to the death. Their decision to perform a tactical repeat marked the end of the battle.
The Flagrant Vandals won!
"Clean up the battlefield and retrieve of mechs and escape pods. Prioritize speed, I don’t want to stick around in this star system longer than we have to. This is just the start. Imodris has more ships on their way."
"Sir, what about the enemy mechs and escape pods?"
"Leave them alone. We don’t have the time to recover their mechs and tend to possible prisoners."
The Calico Dancer Bats sincerely fled from the Vandals. As the cleanup and rescue operation went underway. They received no obstruction from their distant opponents.
As for the enemy escape pods, it appeared that Major Verle didn’t wish to offend the Dancer Bats. After all, the previous battle was fought in an open and upfront fashion. Although the Vandals lost a fair amount of Inheritors, the Calico Dancer Bats didn’t go out of their way to destroy any flying escape pods.
The Vandals held no hard feelings towards the Dancer Bats.
While everyone rejoiced over their minor victory, Ves sighed and pressed his palms over his hand. He could already imagine the mountain load of work that needed to be done after the battle.
Perhaps the Vandals won the engagement by forcing the Dancer Bats to retreat, but they lost quite seriously in terms of mechs and resources.
"Is this what the Calico Dancer Bats are after? They attempted to force a fight not to delay us, but to starve us out?"
This was definitely a devious strategy! Lieutenant Commander Soapstone already told Ves that acquiring more resources was a titanic struggle in the Vesia Kingdom.
Ves gazed obsessively at the projections as they depicted the Vandal mechs retrieving the fallen mechs that hadn’t made it to the end of the battle. This helped much to recoup some of their losses, but they still needed lots of supplements to repair most of the internal damage due to their reckless overload.
"I’m going to hate my job tomorrow. There are way too many issues with those Inheritors. Overloading their systems by thirty percent practically aged their mechs by several years.
Letting all of that wear and tear accumulate to such an extent was ruinous! Ves definitely needed to ride his people hard if he wished to get the Inheritors back to full strength.
The brief battle served as the prelude for their escape. The two companies made it off fairly lightly while the Vandals learned a brutal lesson that they still fell short of matching the military prowess of a proper mech regiment.
More importantly, it also taught him that Ves needed to pay attention to more than just the individual performance of a mech. Formations had the potential to leverage the strengths of the mechs that performed them and allowed them to exploit weaknesses they shouldn’t have been able to do so by themselves.
"This engagement was rather short but devastating to us." Iris softly said. "Even if we drove them off, we won’t be at our best in the following days."
"We’ll just have to pull up our sleeves and work a little harder then." Ves replied. He already started to readjust his plans for the future. "The only thing we can’t do is solve our resource problems. We’re too short on the repairing every Inheritor mech that needs servicing."
Iris didn’t have a solution for him, which he already expected. Neither did Ves for that matter. He needed to think the situation through and consult with the staff before he implemented his plans.
With the lives of thousands at stake, Ves couldn’t afford to be careful and make unilateral decisions on behalf of himself.
The Vandals limped back inside their hangar bays as the fleet prepared to transition into FTL. The gravitic mines that formed such a nuisance to them had been shot down by the marksmen among them. The retreat of their enemy left them with ample time to aim their shots.
Thirty minutes after the end of the battle, the entire fleet successfully transitioned into FTL. They truly fended off extinction, but only for now. The next territory was the Venidse Duchy. The Vandals would all face different circumstances there. At the very least, they needed to get their hands on a lot of materials to cover all the reports.
Ves hated his job.
Now that the fleet entered into FTL, they didn’t have to worry about any enemy attacks for the time being. Each ship could stand down and let the crew relax. Not too much, of course. Plenty of work needed to be done, especially for the mech technicians and mech designers.
Ves frowned at the list of resources the Vandals needed to replenish their losses. The total price tag increased by a third, which signified how many raw materials was required to plug all of the gaps.
"Just a brief skirmish already inflicted so much damage!"
Despite their material losses, the Flagrant Vandals treated it as a win. No matter how skewed their losses turned out to be, they successfully fended off the Calico Dancer Bats and forced them to abort their stalling plans.
Ves knew why the mood was so upbeat. The servicemen really needed a morale booster. Major Verle explicitly ordered everyone smart enough to know the truth to play along with this charade.
He pressed his lips into a line as he wandered across the Shield of Hispania. Everyone acted as if they had become indomitable against all adversity.
To Ves, the Vandals only made it out because of some extreme decisions and the benefit of luck.
If Imodris had been a little more prompt in sending out their reinforcements, the Vandals wouldn’t have made it out at all.
Back at his office, Ves worked hours on end to adjust the timetable in response to the heavy damage sustained by the Inheritors. Even mechs that hadn’t suffered a single scratch would have soothy smoke emerging from the internals.
"More than two-hundred Inheritors are crippled! This is too much!"
The brief period where the mech pilots pushed the overload from twenty to thirty percent represented a painful spike to the mechs they piloted.
Just as Ves thought he would be handling logistical issues for the entire week, Major Verle suddenly called him up to his office. After entering it, the mech officer immediately brought up a disconcerting topic.
"I’m here to discuss the situation with the Finmoth Regal to you. Our investigators have achieved some preliminary results. Read this first."
The major handed over a data pad to Ves, who quickly scoured through the heavily-summarized report. His expression sunk as he realized how far this rabbit hole descended.
When Ves detected something strange from Nemo McAllister’s mech, he traced the suspect work back to a trio of mech technicians aboard the Finmoth Regal. When Ves passed his suspicions to Major Verle, he ordered their arrest.
That was when the bombs exploded. The damage to one of the Regal’s hangar bay was already bad enough, but taking out an engine almost forced the task force to leave her behind.
They couldn’t afford to lose a combat carrier!
Fortunately, the Finmoth Regal was able to keep up by getting towed long enough for her to regain partial propulsion. She was also able to transition into FTL without a problem because FTL travel didn’t rely on sublight propulsion in the first place.
Now that the immediate crisis had passed, Major Verle ordered an extensive inspection of the Finmoth Regal. From top to bottom, everything shady and dubious got exposed.
The data pad listed various minor infractions such as illegal gambling rings and fight clubs. None of those incidents really mattered too much so the Vandals who participated in these kinds of activities only suffered a slap on the wrist.
The investigators focused more on the serious infractions. A loose string of threats and blackmail eventually led to Chief Technician Michael Elin.
"I see now." Ves uttered with shock and disappointment. "Chief Elin was one of the ringleaders responsible for the embezzlement that we cracked down on. I can’t believe he got mixed with traitors."
The three mech technicians who installed the unauthorized modifications in Nemo’s mech couldn’t be brought to questioning because they all blew themselves up. The investigators tried hard, but they couldn’t identify any fellow conspirators. The three had always acted in a low-key manner and made few friends among the crew of the Finmoth Regal. The only person aboard the ship that had a connection to them was the chief that supervised their activities.
As their superior, Chief Elin should have kept a closer eye on what the hidden traitors had been up to. Letting them install unauthorized modifications without a single checkup was a massive act of negligence on the part of the chief.
While chief technicians couldn’t possible ride behind the shoulders of every subordinate, they should at least be diligent enough to check off any completed modifications.
"How did Chief Elin get mixed up with the traitors in the first place?"
"Money, basically." Major Verle sighed and rubbed his tired face. "The treacherous trio got inside his good books and helped him facilitate the embezzlement. They became his left and right arms and did all of the actual work. Through years of pretending to be his dimwitted but loyal henchmen, Chief Elin completely trusted their loyalty."
"Even then, regulations state that chiefs have to double-check everyone’s finished work no matter how much they favor them. How did the traitors manage to get the chief off their backs?"
"They took advantage of the embezzlement that Chief Elin was engaged in. It’s very simple, Mr. Larkinson. As the mastermind behind this scheme, would the chief want to get caught red-handed trying to manipulate the machines that siphoned away a minute portions of valuable exotics?"
"He would want to stay away as far as he can. In fact, it would be better if Chief Elin exposed himself as little as possible."
The traitors certainly outsmarted the greedy chief who thought nothing about his own benefits. The man whose job was to supervise his underlings completely neglected his fundamental duties.
A chief technician’s main job was to direct the mech technicians and stop them from doing any damage! Any other responsibility only served as extras compared to this first demand.
Thus, with the traitors aboard the Finmoth Regal going out with a bang, how could Chief Elin not escape from scrutiny. It took a lot of digging to uncover the hidden files and other shady matters that he had done.
From there, they uncovered a network of over a dozen conspirators, from a security officer that hacked and wiped the ubiquitous monitoring system, to a cargo handler who smuggled packets of high-value exotics to black market dealers whenever the Finmoth Regal berthed at a space station.
The worst thing about it was that the conspiracy even extended to a low-ranking mech designer called Loke Vedette. The hapless chump had immediately been thrown into the brig.
Major Verle emphasized the breadth and depth of the conspiracy. "Chief Elin’s network extended throughout the middle and lower decks of the Finmoth Regal. Through the enticement of profits, he subverted over a dozen pliable Vandals. It’s a failure on multiple levels. Chief responsibility for this failure rests on the Regal’s chief security officer, but the captain is culpable as well. As for Mr. Vedette, he has not fulfilled the responsibilities that we expect from our mech designers."
In other words, Ves shared some of the blame as well for letting Vedette be pulled into Chief Elin’s schemes.
Rather than come up with some excuse that all of this happened prior to being field promoted to head designer, Ves readily accepted the blame. "I have not been thorough enough in my supervision. His failure his my failure."
"Good" Major Verle smiled. "Accepting your faults is the first step to turning this disaster around."
He only acknowledged the blame because he didn’t care too much about his current job. As for blame, in actuality Vedette should have been supervised by Bovis Mercator. So when it came to actual blame, Mercator should have shouldered the brunt of it. Ves already planned a way to get back at his rival for this screw-up. He felt a lot of threat from this ambitious careerist.
"Our security department and I will pass judgement over Chief Elin and his fellow conspirators. The punishments will be handed out by myself as well. While the others have mostly been duped or charmed into participating in Elin’s schemes, the chief himself will likely face the ultimate punishment."
Verle didn’t need to elaborate on what this punishment entailed. Ves heard enough stories from his aunts and uncles to know that the victim deserved every bit of suffering that they had in store.
If Chief Elin was found guilty of gross negligence and betrayal during an active battle in a time of war, he would get what was known as the Cold Burial or Lonely Trek.
The punishment was known as the cold burial because it was pretty much the opposite to the space burial of the honored dead. While servicemen who fell in the line of duty would be flung into the sun to let his physical manifestation experience a rebirth, no such privilege would be granted to traitors.
Chief Elin would pretty much be pushed inside an aircar-sized coffin and be locked with some loose restraints. The coffin would have a miniature life-support system that provided the former chief with a complete circulation of nutrient packs, water and oxygen. Naturally, the waste management system would recycle the waste products and blend them with cultivated organics to produce another batch of nutrient packs.
Basically, the coffin was a tiny prison where a human would theoretically be able to live out their natural lifespan. It cost a fair bit of resources to fabricate such a meticulous self-enclosed ecosystem, but the Bright Republic definitely had the technology to realize such a thing.
However, it was called a coffin and not a prison for a very good reason. Besides these basic amenities, the coffin held nothing else. No distractions, no connections to any networks, not even a shower.
On top of that, the coffin would be operated by an AI whose sole job was to keep the occupant alive as long as possible. The AI insured the prisoner kept being fed and watered while preventing them from committing suicide. To accomplish this, robust robotic arms would be affixed to the insides of the coffin. Like any other component of the coffin, these arms could not be broken by any human force and was meticulously built to last for centuries.
Any human occupant would die long before the coffin succumbed to time.
This cruel punishment where the occupant suffered an endless, lonely trek in the dark of interstellar space was one of the cruelest punishments that the Mech Corps could give out. Personally, Ves thought Major Verle was being a bit excessive by hinting at this punishment.
He much preferred a straightforward execution to end this matter quickly.
"Why did you tell me this, sir? While I’m not a lawyer, I don’t think it’s entirely appropriate for you to talk about Chief Elin’s punishment before his formal trial."
"In this task force, I set the laws." Verle boldly stated. The man practically glowed when he said that. "Trial or not, Chief Elin’s fate is sealed. In our flight from the Kingdom, we can’t afford too many mistakes. Any treachery or acts of negligence puts us further and further away from crossing the borders. An example must be made. The slack that we’ve given the Vandals during peacetime was a mistake. This is the strongest message I can give that any further failures will not be tolerated."
Ves inched a little backward in fright. The mech officer was being really intense right now! "Ah, I understand. You want to kill the chicken to scare the monkeys. That’s a good idea, sir. Maybe the rest of the Vandals that are scheming against our mech regiment will think twice."
"I’m not so optimistic about that. Vandals will be Vandals. Obedience is not in our DNA. There will always be incidents. The key is to encourage my men to tone them down. At the very least, outright treachery and negligence that leads to deaths must not occur again under my watch."
The man shouldered the responsibility of shepherding the task force safely across the borders and reach the promised land of the Reinald Republic. The pressure he faced was immense, so Ves somewhat sympathized with the mech officer.
"One more thing, Mr. Larkinson."
"Yes, sir?"
"You are responsible for building Chief Elin’s coffin. Do it in person. Make it durable and make it last."
The Flagrant Vandals used the next few days in FTL travel to pick up the pieces from the previous skirmish. Despite the relatively short and brief engagement, the fight resulted in a lot of material damage.
Fortunately, a lot of mech pilots escaped their crumbling mechs by ejecting in time. Though the task force had lost a fair amount of precious mechs, they could at least rebuild those in time. It was much harder to recruit and train loyal mech pilots. They represented the foundation of a mech regiment.
Ves spent a fair amount of time delegating the repair work. The Vandals recovered many Inheritor wrecks. Some came in incomplete pieces, and ordinarily Ves would have chosen to discard them, but in this time of scarcity they had no choice but to make the best out of what they gathered.
Thus, he formed plans to piece together and repair each Inheritor with minimum resource demands. He tried to puzzle together compatible pieces as best he could and rely on fabricating replacement parts as little as possible.
The repair work became highly complicated due to the inability of the ships in the fleet to exchange parts and resources with each other. They needed to wait until they transitioned out of FTL before they could perform all the queued transfer requests.
Carletta Haine, the chief technician aboard the Shield of Hispania, provided Ves with her own perspective when he dropped by the hangar bays for a visit.
"Kid, this ain’t nothing yet. Back when I was a snot-nosed techie in the previous war, I’ve seen respectable mech companies descend into rags after they barely survived an extended pursuit. It’s not the big battles that breaks their spirit, but rather the little fights here and there. Every battle saps their willpower and resources, and without any chance of replenishing both, they continued to fracture."
Ves frowned at her words. "Do you think we’ll suffer through the same kind of ordeal?"
"I’m counting on it. Our mission is ten times harder than anything else like it. We’re literally in the heart of the Vesia Kingdom. Do you expect us to breeze past the Vesians as if they’re blind? Even if we are taking advantage of rebel help, the most they can do is pull off some tricks. We’re essentially on our own here."
He didn’t wish to argue this point, having heard it many times before, so he quickly changed topics.
"What do you think about Chief Elin’s trial?"
"Ptuh!" The burly female chief spat. A cleaning bot quickly zipped close and cleaned up her mess. "I always knew he couldn’t get his hands clean. It’s no secret that some of us take liberties now and then, but as long as it isn’t worth more than a few hundred credits, every chief wouldn’t look too closely. That is until your new resource management system arrived."
"We need to save every milligram of materials that we can if we want to survive this gauntlet." Ves nodded in tacit acknowledgement to her implied words. "Fun times are over now. I believe that Alloc would choose to do the same if he was in my shoes."
"Mr. Brandstad is a decent man and a damn good mech designer! Chief Elin is the exact opposite! That man saw the Finmoth Regal as his own little kingdom. Nothing about mechs aboard that combat carrier escaped his sight. He was the Regal’s own little shadow captain."
"Wow, if you knew about all that, why didn’t you report it?"
Chief Haine looked at Ves as if he was stupid. "You’re way too fresh to understand. Suffice to say, I’m glad that stain is gone. I can’t wait to see him drift into space!"
Ves wanted to point out the fact that the trial hadn’t come to a verdict yet, but he knew in his heart that the man’s fate was sealed. Major Verle made his opinions on the trial very clear, and combined with the evidence collected over the course of a few days, a guilty verdict was practically guaranteed.
The reason why he left the office was to prepare the means of Chief Elin’s slow execution. After waving goodbye to Chief Haine, Ves entered one of the Shield of Hispania’s machine shop that normally fabricated ship components and utilized it to build up the cold coffin.
A cold burial happened enough times for the Mech Corps to maintain a standardized blueprint in its central database. They even came in many variants. The cheapest ones would crumble after being hit by a small piece of space junk, while others would bounce off and continue to go down their merry way in deep space.
Ves had been ordered to make a robust coffin, so he opted for a middle quality design that ticked all the boxes. Going for something more extravagant and expensive was a massive waste of time and resources.
He felt strange as he fabricated the coffin part by part. His personal involvement in building something which would be someone’s grave forced him to reflect on his decisions as head designer.
He felt a little responsible for the mess that happened on the Finmoth Regal. "If I didn’t caught the anomalies and pointed them out to Major Verle, maybe all of those deaths could have been prevented."
If he saved his suspicions until the battle was over, perhaps the Finmoth Regal’s security department could have tackled the issue with more finesse.
Still, the situation back then demanded an immediate response. The two suspect Inheritor mechs had replaced their ejection systems with hidden transmitters that sent out who-knew-what to the Vesians. By tackling the transmitters the moment they detected them, the Vandals might have avoided greater calamity.
Ves did not feel guilty for reporting the issue. He only felt as if he could have done something more before the battle erupted.
"Since Chief Elin is one of the most prolific embezzlers, I should have done something more than wash my hands of the past."
He could have talked to Elin or check up on his past actions. Now, it was too late to remedy his mistakes. While Chief Elin didn’t fall under his chain of command, he did hold some responsibilities for the low-ranking mech designer that Elin co-opted in his schemes.
Ves hadn’t decided on what to do yet with Loke Vedette. The young mech designer that had been conscripted into the Mech Corps had been too impressionable against Chief Elin’s devilish charisma.
Still, even if Vedette lacked a lot of experience, a mech designer should have never subordinated himself to a chief. A proper working relationship should have been the other way around.
For now, Vedette stewed in the Finmoth Regal’s brig. Unlike most of his compatriots, he was fortunate enough to escape the fate of a court-martial. All in all, his involvement was very marginal so Ves had been tasked to carry out his judgement.
It didn’t take more than a day to finish fabricating the coffin. It looked more like an oversized ball if nothing else. Built with pure metallic alloys and little else, it contained the bare necessities to form a functional coffin for the living. The shackles that restricted the victim was sturdy enough to resist fatigue and the passage of time, while the life support systems incorporated enough redundancies to keep it working even if thirty percent of its components stopped working.
Anyone who got thrown in this coffin would certainly live up the rest of their lifespan in existential agony. Ves made sure of that by fabricating it to the best of his ability.
The Vandals put it to the test the instant they emerged out of FTL in some nameless Venidse star system. Fortunately, the system was barren from any Vesian presence, so they had the luxury to rest their ships and transfer resources.
Ves boarded a shuttle carrying Major Verle and several other officers to the Finmoth Regal. Once they arrived at the combat carrier, they carried out another burial ceremony for the few mech pilots and ship crew that lost their lives during the previous skirmish.
Just like last time, many Vandals throughout the task force attended the ceremony through their virtual avatars. Major Verle kept his words fairly brief, and the coffins had all been launched towards the Vesian sun.
"Now that we have sent off our honored dead, it is time for someone else to receive the fate that he deserves."
A floater platform carried forth the hefty cold coffin that Ves had fabricated. At the sight of the familiar object, every Vandal began to scowl or frown. They knew what it meant, and they knew who was about to be buried inside.
A pair of security officers dragged forth a heavily restrained prisoner to the coffin. Chief Elin’s court-martial had been broadcasted throughout the fleet yesterday, where he hardly stood a chance against the overwhelming array of evidence against him. With Major Verle bent on setting an example, the former chief was destined for the coffin in the very next day.
"MMmhhmmhmm! Mmhmmhmmm!"
Elin’s bloodshot eyes looked frantic as he tried to speak around the gag that kept his mouth shut. Maybe he wanted to profess his innocence. Maybe he wanted to curse the brass. Maybe he wanted to drag his comrades down with him. Nobody moved to take away his gag, because the words of the traitor was not worth listening.
Ves happened to sit besides Loke Vedette. He took the mech designer that had been duped by Chief Elin out of the brig so that he could witness the ultimate fate of someone who’s negligence had led to deaths.
"Look closely Vedette. This is the chief you thought who knew how to do your job better. I hope you learn not to lean on others too much for guidance next time."
"Y-Y-Yes sir!"
The two hardly differed in age. Both of them had not yet reached their thirties. Yet their wide gulf in status and capability separated them at different heights. Ves constantly improved and had a bright future ahead of himself, while Vedette was someone who failed to make a name of himself after graduating as a mech designer.
Thus, Ves had no compunctions in treating Vedette as a junior. He even felt a lot of pity for Vedette, to the point of giving him a slap on the wrist.
In any case, the task force was short on mech designers. They couldn’t afford to throw capable help in the brig where they would rot for the duration of this mission.
In any case, Ves looked pleased at Vedette’s outward reverence towards him. It made him feel powerful and put him in a good mood. He resolved to keep an eye on the young man and see whether he could grow from this potentially career-ending ordeal.
The final ritual almost came to an end. Major Verle stepped down from the podium and approached the well-made coffin. "Mr. Michael Elin, as the former chief technician aboard the Finmoth Regal, you have betrayed your oaths and your fellow Vandals in the naked pursuit for profit. Yesterday, you have been found guilty to every charge laid on your foot. Frankly, it disgusts me to be on the same deck as you."
Some of the more unruly Vandals broke the solemn silence by jeering at the gagged and frantic chief. Even now, Elin tried to weasel his way out of his macabre fate.
"We treated you as a comrade and a brother. When every other mech regiment rejected to take you on, we welcomed you with open arms. Whatever transgressions you had done in the past was irrelevant in our eyes. However, that does not mean that our ability to forget extends to the present time."
The major’s eyes hardened as his full weight as a mech officer bore down on the former chief. Elin shied away at the intensity of Verle’s stare.
"Out of everyone involved in this conspiracy, nobody is more culpable than you. There is no forgiveness for scum like you. Not even a quick death will suffice to atone for the damage you have done to us. I hope you will find some absolution in your endless trek into space."
Elin jerked his shackled body like his life depended on it, but the restraints and the grip of the security officers kept him firmly under control. The cold coffin’s hatch opened up, allowing the security officers to haul their prisoner inside and affix him to the restraints of the interior of the coffin.
By all intents and purposes, it was a perpetual cell which would keep Elin locked without any chance of escape. Freedom from captivity and life would never grace the guilty chief until his natural lifespan ran out.
The Finmoth Regal turned around and oriented her hangar bay away from the sun and directly into deep space. With a soft anti-grav push, the hefty cold coffin began its Lonely Trek across the galaxy.
The Cold Burial came at an end.
The Vandals moved on quickly after the two seperate burial ceremonies. Ves noticed that the Vandals had become much more honest and subdued after witnessing Chief Elin’s gruesome fate.
Before he took the shuttle back to the Shield of Hispania, Ves stayed behind on the Finmoth Regal for a few hours to take a brief round of inspection. As the head designer, Ves had access to all of the hangar bays, mech stables and mech workshops.
Vedette walked behind Ves in a subdued fashion as they took in the state of the maintenance department aboard the Finmoth Regal.
Ves took in the lethargic expressions of the mech technicians. All of them suffered badly from the revelation that Chief Elin and some of their colleagues dabbled in treachery. To the Vandals, betraying their fellow brothers and sisters in arms was the worst crime imaginable.
Even if the entire galaxy turned against the Flagrant Vandals, their bonds would never break!
"Take a look at these mech technicians at work, Mr. Vedette. What do you see?"
"Uhmm.. they’re not working as hard as before. Chief Elin used to be our ultimate boss. Without his presence, no one knows what to do."
"This is the consequence of your missteps." Ves bluntly said. "What is this section supposed to do?"
"They’re tasked with dismantling a partially-damaged the Inheritor."
"Why are they slacking off?"
The junior mech designer’s mouth gaped like a fish. Ves really wanted to smack the young man’s face for his indecisiveness.
"Remember who you are! You’re a mech designer, not a mech technician! These men and women should listen to you, especially now that they are devoid of a chief!"
"B-B-But I’m too new at this!"
"Your brains are ten times larger than all of theirs put together. Go out there and get those mech technicians back to work!"
Ves gently pushed Vedette’s back. Due to his enhanced body, this turned out to be a hefty push that caused the junior to stumble straight into the mech technicians.
"Eh? Watch where you are going!"
"Hey, it’s Vedette!"
The mech designer regained his balance and tried to speak at the mech technicians. "Guys, please go back to work. We’re way behind schedule, so please disassemble this mech."
The mech technicians laughed as if a little boy told them to scram.
"It’s our break time right now! We need our rest. Do you expect us to work around the clock? We’ll fall apart if we can’t enjoy some peace!"
"Get lost Vedette! Chief Elin isn’t here anymore, so go grovel to someone else!"
"This ain’t a place for you to hang around. Go back to your office and let us grease monkeys stew in the muck!"
Just around the corner, Ves palmed his face. Vedette’s lack of spine reminded Ves of that Vesian mech designer he met back in the outskirts of Neron City. Ves already forgot the name of that Novice, but the sheer lack of courage both men shared meant that neither of them had much of a future in the mech industry.
Normally, Ves didn’t care too much whether another mech designer possessed the grit needed to make something out of their mech design careers, but Vedette happened to be one of his subordinates. Even if he lacked any promise, Ves had a duty to do something about this sad state of affairs. The Finmoth Regal’s maintenance department couldn’t afford to proceed without any direction.
Ves stepped around the corner and slowly strode forward. He carefully composed his face and unconsciously channeled some of his inner steel.
The entire compartment experienced a drastic change in atmosphere. It wasn’t anything a sensor could measure, but when Ves stepped into view, the mech technicians instantly lost their jovialness.
"Ah, Head Designer Larkinson! Fancy seeing you here!"
All eight mech technicians stood at attention as if they faced Major Verle himself. In truth, Ves merely imitated the air of command that the mech officer projected so well during his speeches.
Inwardly, he nodded in satisfaction. Learning from the best may not always be the most appropriate course of action, but it always guaranteed a measure of success. He was satisfied enough with what he achieved.
"You mentioned your former chief back then. As I recall, we just chucked him out into the wrong direction of space. Do you know why we sent him out?"
"Uhhh.. because he was a traitor?"
"WRONG!" Ves barked, which instantly caused the mech technicians to shrink back. Unfortunately, Vedette reacted the strongest against his eruption. "Chief Elin was a piece of work, alright, and he was charged with many crimes. However, his most principle failure was his enormous negligence on the job! To put it into terms your tiny brains can understand, he failed to do his job!"
Everyone’s eyes widened. Though they understood the gravity of Chief Elin’s failings, they only treated it as something that had nothing to do with them. Certainly, they missed their former chief who acted as a firm but reliable supervisor to them, but they did not connect his failings to their own.
Ves shook them from that idea. "The entire reason Major Verle reserved the punishment of the Lonely Trek to your former chief is because his tolerance for such failings is at an end. Now, look at yourselves. Disassembling this damaged mech will take at least an entire shift if you don’t want to aggravate the damage. Looking at the time, and a third of your shift has already gone by. Do you think you can afford to slack off with two-thirds of your shift left to go?"
"No, sir! Sorry, sir, we’ll get right back to work!"
"Then do so! I’ll be keeping an eye on your work. If I don’t see this mech disassembled at the end of the shift, I’ll make sure you’ll regret it!"
The mech technicians picked up their tools and scampered around the damaged Inheritors as if hyperactive demons possessed their bodies.
Vedette witnessed the entire exchange with wide eyes and a gaping mouth. The man trudged after Ves like a zombie after the latter gestured him forward and moved out of earshot from the mech technicians.
"Did you see how it’s done?"
"You’re the head designer, sir." Vedette whined. "I can’t hope to match your authority!"
This time, Ves couldn’t resist his urges. He lightly smacked Vedette’s cheek, causing the man to yelp in an annoyingly girly fashion.
"Authority or not, you’re a mech designer! Have some pride in our profession!"
In the natural order of the galaxy, a mech technician stood in the lowest rung and followed the instructions of a chief technician. In turn, these chiefs received their instructions from a mech designer.
Even with the temporary absence of a chief, a mech designer should still be able to command a bunch of mech technicians.
Ves had been in the trenches himself a few times during the Groening Mission and the Glowing Planet campaign. Taking charge of mech technicians should have been an essential skill to every mech designer.
A bit helplessly, Ves had to spoonfeed some methods for Vedette to command authority and force the mech technicians to listen to his orders.
"The Vandals will need some time to sort out the hierarchy. Last I heard, Major Verle isn’t too happy with Chief Elin’s deputies. All but one turned out to be his accomplices, and the remaining chump lacks the qualities we expect from a chief. Therefore, it’s likely that a trustworthy deputy from another ship will be transferred to the Finmoth Regal to assume his duties as your new chief technicians."
Vedette appeared relieved at the news, which was exactly the wrong response to make in front of Ves.
"Don’t think you can slack off as well once the new chief takes charge! Your responsibilities are still the same whether a chief is present or not! Keep watch over the mech technicians and help them solve any complicated problems that might come up, but don’t forget to maintain their productivity at the highest level possible!"
"Ah, I’ll try my best, sir!"
"Trying is not enough. Confidence comes from belief in yourself. Every mech designer ought to be confident in the superiority of their knowledge. If there is any crutch you need to lean on, then lean on that if nothing else."
"I’ll take that under advisement, sir!"
After performing his deed for the day, Ves left Vedette to figure things out on his own and boarded a shuttle that brought him back to the Shield of Hispania.
In truth, while Ves could have propped up the junior, he wasn’t strictly obligated to provide so much guidance. Still, Ves took up some of his valuable time to guide Vedette to the right path because he wanted to practice his ability to teach.
"It also helps to make a connection with Mr. Vedette."
Ves didn’t have much hope that Vedette would amount to anything, but he never ruled out the possibility. If Mr. Vedette turned out to be a gem in the rough, then Ves would be glad to have the foresight to lay down a connection at a premature stage.
He wanted to build more bridges like this with other mech designers, but it was impossible for him to waste so much time by interacting with so many subordinates.
Another reason why he interacted with people this way was to borrow position as head designer to temper his leadership abilities. Back when he founded and expanded the Living Mech Company, he relied too much on readily-available retainers from the Larkinson Family to do all of the heavy lifting.
Their competence satisfied the needs of his company, so Ves had nothing to complain with the help provided by the Family. The presence of Jake and Chief Cyril lifted a load off his shoulders and freed him from the trifles of managing the company and his subordinates. This left him free to pursue his primary passion, which was to work on designing better mechs.
Thinking back on that period of rapid growth, Ves recently started to doubt whether he made the right decision. "It’s hard to hire competent and trustworthy help."
Sometimes, he believed these qualities to be mutually exclusive. Either he could hire someone trustworthy like Carlos that wasn’t very good at his job, or he could hire a seasoned veteran like Chief Cyril who was highly capable and practical but also deferential to Ves. Yet the chief’s lingering ties to the Family made Ves question sometimes whether he would ultimately listen to those who had nurtured him for decades.
There were even times when his paranoia spiked to the point where he became disillusioned to the company that he founded on his own. Much of what the LMC did was seemingly out of his grasp. He could hardly wrap his mind around the scope of their strategies and activities.
His temporary promotion to head designer shone a light through the fog that had slowly accumulated in his mind. His doubts about leadership began to fade as he tackled his new responsibilities with a motivation to learn as much as possible.
It was like a second start to Ves. Already, he learned an important lesson. "Nurturing subordinates who are both competent and trustworthy takes time. There aren’t any shortcuts to growing my own following. Not if I want to do it properly."
He already resolved to invest in any promising seeds he could find. Ves owed the Flagrant Vandals his gratitude for pushing him into a leadership position, however brief it might last. As head designer, Ves believed he could start to learn how to exert leadership properly instead of outsourcing it to someone else.
"Some responsibilities shouldn’t be shifted to others. It’s best if I learn how to perform them on my own. Otherwise, who is actually the one in charge?"
Ves had plenty of items on the agenda to flex his leadership muscles. From dealing with the fallout of the skirmish to reprimanding Mercator for dropping the ball on Vedette, Ves faced an endless tide of problems that require the Vandals to do their best if they wanted to escape from being engulfed.
They spent a decent time skulking about in Venidse space. As one of the larger territories of the Vesia Kingdom, its vast space offered the Flagrant Vandals lots of desolate star systems to hide. For now, they hadn’t seen hair nor hide of Venidse patrols.
There was a very good reason for that according to Iris.
"Do you think Venidse can become a worthy rival to Imodris without effort?" She began. "Imodris is closer to the core than Venidse. In addition, it jointly operates a strategically important port system. While the amount of wealth that flows through their hands can’t match the trade that goes on in your famous Bentheim system, neither does the government siphon vast majority of wealth to subsidize the rest of the state."
Bentheim’s wealth distribution was a fact of life to the Bright Republic. Otherwise, the Bentheim Liberation Movement wouldn’t have grown so powerful and pervasive.
"So Venidse has to do something to match their rival in strength, then. You said that it’s relatively well-endowed with resources. Is that enough to offset the trade that’s captured by Imodris?"
"That’s the complication. It’s true that Venidse encompasses a lot of resource-rich star systems, but it takes a significant amount of labor and capital to extract them. That means people, equipment and bots."
Ves started to get an inkling of what she wanted to say. "The latter two is expensive, and relying too much on machines opens up a lot of vulnerabilities. So they have to rely a lot on labor as well."
"Living in Venidse isn’t very charming. Aside from a couple of model planets, most of their planets are low-class hives where human lives are treated as valuable as cattle."
When he was young, the Bright Republic often showed how life in the Kingdom was awful for the lower classes. Their poorest had to toil in dangerous mines or spend endless hours supervising bots that did the exact same thing over and over again on the off-chance it glitched or caught a virus.
He recalled the city of Haston on Bentheim. That place was a concentration of the poorest on Bentheim and was a hotbed of BLM sympathy.
If Haston’s circumstances magnified into entire planets, then Venidse’s rebel group should be as powerful if not more than the BLM!
"The Venidse Liberators is one of the largest and most influential rebel movement in the Kingdom. Though they aren’t particularly good at anything, they have access to a fair amount of resources and they are extremely numerous."
Ves paid a lot of attention to the fact that the VL accumulated a lot of resources. Perhaps that was why Major Verle chose to raid one of their facilities and trade with the rebel group during their passage through the territory.
"How powerful is Venidse’s military?"
"Very powerful. Very numerous. I already told you about their mech doctrine. Since they have a lot of fingers in the resource extraction sector, they have the enviable ability to obtain much of their materials at near-cost price. This means they can fabricate more mechs at the same cost, which eventually accumulates into fielding more mech legions than any other territory."
"I see. It makes sense. A preference for attrition warfare can only be sustained if you have enough mechs to throw at the enemy." Ves said contemplatively.
"However, most of their numbers advantage is negated by the existence of the VL. The rebels have caused so much trouble over the decades that most of Venidse’s military is burdened with guarding population centers, industries, mines and important installations. While that doesn’t give us carte blanche to saunter in Vendise’s space, we at least don’t have to fight Venidse’s troops every step of the way."
When Ves attended meetings with Major Verle and his staff, they all echoed the same refrain. Despite the might of Venidse’s mech legions, they treated it as an opportunity to bounce back. The only point they argued about was deciding on which star system to raid.
Attacking a prosperous star system would go a long way in reducing their resource deficits. Attacking a less prominent planet came with a lot less risk as they didn’t have to face any significant defenses.
Whatever the case, the Vandals only had enough time to attack a single star system. Attacking two systems at a time would delay their schedule and make them miss the two-month deadline.
Ves mostly stayed silent on this topic during the heated discussions in the conference room. He only provided some advice on which star system held the resources they needed and would be worthwhile to raid.
Up to now, Major Verle still hadn’t made up his mind.
Besides taking part in those deadlocked discussions, Ves also began to make good on his promises by teaching the mech designers who worked hard enough to win a carrot. Predictably, most opted to borrow a valuable textbook from the central database, but one person happened to request personal tutelage.
"When I heard you wanted me to teach you, I was surprised." Ves said to Pierce over the projection. "If you wanted me to give you a few pointers, I would have given it for free."
Pierce shook his head. "I have my own pride, and I don’t want to take advantage of you. Knowledge that comes free is not as sweet as knowledge that I’ve earned through my own efforts. My time learning the craft from my father has taught me that. I’m not as talented as you. I need to work for it. Otherwise, the knowledge won’t stick."
Ves hadn’t paid much attention to Pierce the past few days. They traveled on different ships, which made it inconvenient to chat with each other. In addition, Ves spent most of his time with Iris lately. The rebel-aligned mech designer was an attentive conversation partner who patiently brought him up to speed with regards to the Kingdom.
That said, he should have kept more in touch with Pierce. The Coalition-born mech designer had been assigned to the Beggar’s Bounty, one of the two logistics ships of the task force. This was an important posting as Pierce had access to vastly more resources and facilities than anyone else. Though that made his work more complex, the man nonetheless persevered and exceeded his weekly quota.
Ves admired such dedication from his acquaintance, especially since he knew that Pierce was a rather mediocre mech designer.
His background as a mech designer from the Friday Coalition also held some promise. Though Ves did not need to establish any ties with his father, just his citizenship was valuable enough to open some doors that would be closed to a foreigner like Ves.
This was why Ves immediately changed his stance towards Pierce and beheld him with a bit more care.
"Well, you’ve earned the privilege of receiving my teachings fair and square. You’ll get a full hour from me, which should be enough to solve most of your bottlenecks and burning questions. Don’t waste it. While I’m proficient with most of the fundamentals, I happen to excel in Physics and lasers. So ask your questions."
Pierce dove into the questioning with glee. He started out with basic but tricky questions on multiple fields, and when he found out that Ves answered his questions without any effort, his questions began to encompass more and more complexity.
To Ves, answering the questions forced him to be thoughtful. As an Apprentice Mech Designer, Pierce wasn’t stupid, and he didn’t ask any stupid questions. Though the level of his questions didn’t exceed the Journeyman-level, he nonetheless tread into territory that even Ves would pause at. All he could do was to use his superior Intelligence and Skills to churn out an answer on the spot.
At the end of the tutoring session, Pierce quickly excused himself from the call to digest the answers he received. Ves was left alone in his office to stew over the teaching session. Surprisingly, he enjoyed flexing his brain in this manner. There was something enjoyable about guiding a junior into understanding the problems that perplexed him for months or years.
"Heh." He chuckled. "Maybe I’ll be a professor someday."
While he didn’t feel too strongly about becoming a full-time teacher, he figured he could still treat it like a side activity. A lot of Journeymen and Seniors who owned successful businesses diverted some of their valuable time to teach at various universities and institutions. Obviously, they gained a lot of benefits for doing so. Since Ves happened to enjoy the act of teaching, he seriously started considering whether he should take a teaching position in the future.
"No one hires an Apprentice to teach at an institution. It’s too soon for Journeymen to pass on their knowledge. I’ll have to advance to Senior before I can become a respectable professor."
That would be a very long time away. Ves did not dare to predict when he would be able to advance to such an exalted rank, but it should at least be several decades away. Even with the help of the System, Ves did not belittle the difficulties involved with advancing past the vast majority of his peers. It wasn’t easy to become a Journeyman, let alone a Senior.
"That is something to consider after this damned war is over. Right now, I’ve got to get back to work."
After the brief tutoring session, Ves returned to his duties. He checked with the mech technicians and made sure they didn’t slack off on the job. He corresponded with his deputies and made sure they did the same. He liaised with Lieutenant Commander Soapstone and begged her to tap more into the task force’s material reserves. He listened to the staff trying to argue which star system they should raid.
He also planned and supervised the repairs of the Inheritors. The good thing about the damaged Inheritors was that the skirmish with the Calico Dancer Bats didn’t lead to a lot of material losses. Most of the damage the Inheritors sustained turned out to be self-inflicted as the lengthy twenty percent overload combined with the thirty percent spike led to a lot of internal disarray.
This meant that cables got fried or melted and circuits got heat-blasted. While that sounded bad and time-consuming to repair, Ves vastly preferred this type of internal damage because the Inheritors hadn’t lost any materials. Fried components could easily be recycled and be used to fabricate new components.
The only issue was that it took a lot of time to effect the repairs. The damage ran throughout the entire interior of the frame, so every overloaded Inheritor mech pretty much required a complete disassembly. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to repair or replace the innermost parts which happened to be the most vital ones that ensured the continued operation of the mechs.
All of this took time, too much time for them to adhere to the original timetable. Ves had to go back to the original planning and scrap some of the procedures he had in store just to make room for the unexpected repair work.
Naturally, the Inheritors that sustained actual battle damage required a bit more effort to bring them back into working capacity. The worst wrecks they retrieved from the battlefield were woefully incomplete or had been riddled with holes. To bring these Inheritors back online, the mech technicians demanded a lot of resources.
They didn’t have enough to go around.
"We really need more resources, and they have to be the right ones as well."
The task force still carried valuable exotics and other materials in their cargo holds. Major Verle hoped to hold on to them until they reached a market system where they could dispose of their ill-gotten goods at fair market prices. Trading them away at this point wouldn’t help the Vandals reduce their debt burden.
It was obvious that if the Major Verle didn’t wish to give away their wealth to unscrupulous rebel traders, they urgently needed to get their needed supplies through another method.
After several days of uncertainty and procrastination, they finally decided on which star system they wanted to raid.
The Shield of Hispania’s conference room hosted a lot of contentious meetings lately. Ship captains, mech officers and staff officers all congregated in a single room to decide on which Venidse star system they should descend upon.
Everyone had their ideas. The hawks, which predominantly consisted of mech officers, wanted to raid a resource-rich system. Of course, they didn’t aim their sights to systems comparable to the Detemen System. They couldn’t afford to get bogged down by several hundred mechs.
The hawks picked out a number of targets that seemed very ambitious to Ves. Even if the Vandals rolled over the opposition, they would still pay a significant price.
The risk-averse crowd that comprised of other mech officers and the majority of the staff officers advocated for caution. The fleet was running low on certain resources, and they weren’t at their best. Attacking a smaller, safer target should be the way to go.
These two groups had been at loggerheads for days. Ves watched on as the majority swung back and forth, all the while Major Verle showed uncharacteristic indecisiveness.
Ves was about Verle’s stance. Throughout all of their time together, his impressions of the grizzled veteran had been as a staunch leader and a ruthless decision maker that wouldn’t hesitate to take the most expedient course of action.
For him to withhold his decision at this junction puzzled Ves a little bit. Did he truly hesitate on his decision right now, or did he wish for the argument to play out?
His instincts believed that it must have been a deliberate choice. Ves mostly sat in the sidelines, so he could look at the entire situation with some detachment. Looking at the various officers attending the meetings via their projections while arguing passionately about their opinions, perhaps it all served as one giant distraction.
Every leader in the task force focused their energies into deciding which star system to raid. Some spent hours in research and preparation to present the most compelling arguments on why their targeted star systems was the most suitable ones to attack.
The momentous discussion distracted them from the misfortune they suffered in the past. Rather than allowing them to dwell at their failings, Verle sneakily used the meetings to direct his most important subordinates into thinking about their next steps forward.
Ves would have applauded the shrewd commanding officer if he wasn’t afraid of giving the game away. He felt as if he constantly absorbed new tricks by staying in Major Verle’s vicinity.
Eventually, the game had to come to an end. After yet another exhausting back-and-forth, Verle abruptly stood to announce his decision.
"We shall change course towards the Hachew System."
As expected, Major Verle chose to settle on a compromise. His answers didn’t satisfy any of the participants, but it hadn’t snubbed anyone either. An awkward atmosphere descended as everyone came to grips with the decision.
"The Hachew System isn’t as well-defended as prosperous systems, but neither is it barren to the point of calling it a rural system. It hosts a moderate military presence and a handful of mines. Its value is nothing special, but it happens to extract some of the materials we are desperately short on. This should be sufficient to replenish some of our scarcity."
Ves quietly nodded as he read through the basic details of the Hachew System from the panel projected in the middle of the conference table. While it wouldn’t enrich the Vandals and allow them to gain more trade goods for them to exchange for what they needed from the rebels, it did happen to contain some of the ores and materials that was vital in repairing and strengthening the Inheritor mechs.
The Hachew System actually looked like a destination that Ves would recommend himself if he didn’t wish to refrain from taking part in the internal politics of the Flagrant Vandals.
"Prepare for battle. The Hachew System isn’t very far away. Make sure our mechs are ready to deploy with as much strength as they can muster."
The task force had been drifting deeper into Venidse. It wouldn’t take too much of a course change to reach the Hachew System. This told Ves that the entire show had been premeditated from the start. Major Verle already had a destination in mind before they even crossed into Venidse space!
Ves could tell that some of the other Vandals came to the same realization. However, they only amounted to twenty percent of the participants at most.
After the meeting came at an end, every projection winked out while those who were physically present left the compartment.
"Mr. Larkinson."
"Ah, yes sir?"
Major Verle walked up to him and asked an important question. "The next raid will require both spaceborn and landbound mechs. Can we field a sufficient amount of both at this stage?"
"Our spaceborn mech contingent requires more time to get back up to full strength. I’m sorry, but it will take at least two weeks to recover the majority of the Inheritors that sustained internal damage. The material damage was light but very comprehensive, so we have to rebuild them from the ground up. This is a necessary but time-consuming process. Even if you exhort my mech designers to work faster, it’s unrealistic to expect them to be up and running in time for the Hachew raid."
The major furrowed his brows. "I did not anticipate the damage has reached such an extent. This isn’t the first time we’ve overloaded the Inheritors. Every time, they bounced back fairly swiftly."
"I know, sir. I’ve browsed the archives. This is different, though. Previously, we had access to the Wolf Mother, which is an ad-hoc but fully functional factory ship. The production lines aboard that ship is capable of mass-producing an enormous amount of mech parts as long as we can feed enough materials into them. That’s not possible now that we split up the main fleet. The two logistics ships our task force has retained can only do a fraction of the work of a factory ship."
To put it simply, the Verle Task Force got the short end of the stick when it came to the split. The Wolf Mother, Colonel Lowenfield, Major Verle and two of their remaining Journeyman Mech Designers had all been retained by the diminished main fleet that was on their way back to Republic space.
"Our landbound mechs?"
"They require a lot of repairs as well. We’ve never had the time to recover all of the damage our landbound mechs sustained in the Detemen Operation. It’s been something of a low priority for us. According to our original schedule, we should have shifted more workers towards repairing the landbound mechs after crossing into Venidse. The destructive aftermath of the recent skirmish delayed that plan."
This put Major Verle in a worse position than he wished. Though the task force was still capable of fielding a respectable amount of spaceborn and landbound mechs, the shortages would hurt. Less mechs meant less reserves and a smaller margin for error.
Verle should have access to most of this information already. Ves was very punctual in his reports. It seemed to him that the man was desperate for hope.
Unfortunately for the both of them, Ves couldn’t magically conjure up additional mechs. Hope didn’t work that way.
"I will endeavor to ready as much mechs as possible in time for the raid, but don’t expect too much from us, sir."
"We shall settle on that."
Ves walked away with a lot of uncertainty from that. The longer this trip progressed, the more he understood Verle’s burden. Despite knowing little about the mech officer’s history, he felt he became more in tune with Verle with each passing day.
The Hachew System shouldn’t pose any threat to the Vandals. It was a system whose wealth sat between a rural system and an industrial system. In other words, wealthier than Cloudy Curtain but poorer than the Detemen System.
Unless Venidse predicted their destination beforehand, the Hachew System shouldn’t be capable of inflicting heavy casualties to the Vandals.
Yet hadn’t the LMC once trounced a Vesian raiding party?
"Don’t underestimate the locals."
The Flagrant Vandals chose to raid the Hachew System because it held a number of strategically important mines to them. Any mine of value would be guarded. Fighting past these company forces was a nuisance at best, and a serious hindrance at worse.
"Besides the company forces, there’s also reinforcements to consider."
The Vesians were still up in arms about their mortal enemy gallivanting in their space. Venidse might have felt a lot of schadenfreude when Imodris failed to stop the escaping Vandals from leaving their territory. Now that they ended up in Venidse space, the duchy couldn’t afford to be as incompetent as Imodris back then. They would be hard at work trying to seek and destroy their vulnerable fleet.
The next couple of days, Ves threw himself into his work again. He exhorted his subordinates to speed up their repair work. Even one extra mech could make a lot of difference on the battlefield.
He even decided to pull up his own sleeves and perform some hands-on repairs of the most difficult cases aboard the Shield of Hispania. A lot of mech technicians looked perplexed when the head designer got his hands dirty, but Ves had been able to shorten a broken Inheritor’s repairs in a single day where it took a full crew of mech technicians an entire week.
The work served as a nice distraction from the difficulties he had to deal with on a daily basis. That was also why he didn’t show up again after repairing two of the most difficult mechs. It wasn’t appropriate for him to devote all of his time to grunt work.
Back at his office, Ves got to play the manager. He juggled various responsibilities and priorities at once. All of this work and effort sent him into a contemplative mood.
"Is it worth it?"
Iris looked up again from her corner desk. "What’s that, boss?"
"Do you ever think about how much effort we put in fabricating, selling, using, repairing and recycling mechs? How much money and resources are we expending on using mechs? The Flagrant Vandals alone are wasting billions of credits on an annual basis to maintain their strength. It’s mind-boggling once you think about it. Are we working in vain?"
"I hope not." Iris furrowed her brow. "We’re mech designers. If everyone stops using mechs, we’ll all go out of business."
"The mech craze that has infected humanity four-hundred years ago is pretty much an artificial phenomenon. If not for the restriction on warships and the enforcement of the taboos, we would still be waging war with mighty ships."
"We would have been extinct by that time, sir. We were too eager with wiping out our own planets. I’m glad our race as a whole had managed to come together and agree to switch to mechs as a way to resolve our differences. We don’t have to fear from genocidal maniacs anymore."
Ves shrugged at that. "All I’m saying is that there is a price for that. If you compare mechs to warships, which one do you think will prevail?"
He once witnessed a single small warships tearing apart a horde of spaceborn pirate mechs in the Glowing Planet campaign. That image of complete annihilation had been seared into his brain like a trauma that would never go away.
Ever since then, his faith in mechs had been cracked.
"Much of humanity has been proven to be too irresponsible for their own good. The intervention of the CFA and MTA was necessary to save our race from a spiral of destruction. Even they treated us as kids playing with fire, it’s for the best."
"Being treated like children means we aren’t allowed to grow up." Ves retorted. "It’s been four-hundred years. I think we’ve learned enough lessons now. All of this mech warfare seems like play-acting to me sometimes."
Iris looked concerned. "Are you ill, sir? Do you need to visit the infirmary again? I’ve never heard of a mech designer who questions his own craft!"
"I don’t know what’s wrong with me either, but I’m not sick. I just have a premonition that the status quo can’t go on forever. One day, the system will break."
Even without any solid proof, Ves believed what he said. Mechs were fine tools of war, but when it came down to it, a mech could never match the destruction that could be unleashed by a proper warship.
Some day, all of humanity had need of that destruction.
"When we made plans to raid the Hachew System, I expected our mechs to batter the Vesians every step of the way." Ves spoke with a perplexed expression. "Rather than acting as the barbarians at the gates, I feel as if we are more like the tax collector coming to collect the annual tax."
When the Verle Task Force emerged out of FTL in the Hachew System, the local garrison immediately panicked. Instead of readying themselves to fight to the death, the outnumbered and outgunned defense squadron immediately fled to the nearest Lagrange point and transitioned to anywhere but here.
This allowed the Flagrant Vandals to waltz towards Hachew III, the only inhabited planet in the system. Once the combat carriers that conveyed their landbound mechs made landfall, they came across deserted cities, open warehouses and meagerly defended industries.
Not a single inhabitant took up arms to defend against the invaders. Without any signs of organized opposition, the Vandals practically acted with impunity on the surface of Hachew III!
While the Vandals remained alert and ready to switch to battle mode, there was also a palpable sense of ease running through their heads. Nobody in the command center seemed suspicious that they had entered a trap of sorts.
After slogging through the Detemen Operation and getting their butts kicked by the Calico Dancer Bats, Ves had a hard time trying to adjust to the lack of obstacles put in their way. What was it about the Hachew System that made them lose their will to fight?
"Iris?"
"It’s simple, really. The ruler of Hachew III is Baron Imica of House Sabanet. His lineage isn’t as long and storied as that of a count. His defense force only consists of three companies of spaceborn mechs and four companies of landbound mechs. Do you think that’s a lot? The Flagrant Vandals can easily smash them apart, especially considering we are talking about garrison mechs!"
"Even then, it would benefit Venidse if House Sabanet puts up a fight. They’re outnumbered, but not to the extent where we can win an instant victory. If they resort to harassment and guerilla warfare, they can easily ruin our raid."
"There’s the key, boss. What does Baron Imica have to do with Venidse? The Duke of Venidse doesn’t care about a tiny baron at all! Certainly, Baron Imica can order his household troops to put up a valiant fight against us, but what will that accomplish? Victory is impossible, and at worst he might lose all of the mechs he painstakingly funded over several decades. The Hachew System barely ekes out a profit for the house, so each mech is extraordinarily valuable to him. Unless he stands to gain more than he loses, Baron Imica will absolutely refuse to throw away his mechs to a lost cause."
"That’s surprisingly rational of the baron." Ves remarked as if he had never seen a rational noble before. "Won’t he get punished by Venidse?"
"Hah! No duke can compel a baron to send the foundation of his power into a suicide mission. Garrison mechs stand no chance against proper military mechs, and that’s not taking into account that we outnumber them. Conserving your strength and denying us an easy victory is par for the course. At worst, House Sabanet will suffer a couple of years of disgrace and become a pariah in high society, but as long as they maintain their strength, they won’t have to worry about their rivals deposing them from power."
Ves frowned at that. "This sounds as if House Sabanet are more wary of their domestic rivals than a foreign enemy."
"This raid is a one-off chance. The chances that Vandals will return to raid their planet again is practically nil. They’ve probably written off their material losses as a consequence from a massive freak accident. Wealth and goods is easy to replenish, but control over an entire planet is harder to regain when lost."
What Iris said probably rang true. The Vandal mechs that made landfall sauntered over the planet like they owned it. Though many industry complexes brandished their company forces, when push came to shove, the company goons retreated without firing a single shot.
The previous displays of intimidation always turned out to be bluffs. The company forces had orders to dissuade the Vandals from picking a fight with them, but because they were vastly outnumbered, their owners were loathe to throw them away in a senseless battle.
House Sabanet already set an example for the smaller players to follow. If the big guys refused to make a sacrifice, why should everyone else be selfless? It was every Vesian for themselves!
"Compared to foreign aggressors like you, their rivals are more immediate opponents to House Sabanet." Iris continued her explanation. "In the eyes of their neighbors, they want nothing more than see House Sabanet lose all of their mechs in a lopsided battle. Once the Vandals take their spoils and leave, the rivals can swoop in to claim Hachew III from the hands of the now-toothless House."
"That sounds really messed up. If House Sabanet sacrifices their mechs in battle against us, they should receive a commendation!"
"Who would give them their commendation? Hm? Mechs are expensive. Even Venidse can’t magically compensate two-hundred mechs to a small baron on a whim. The games nobility play is a ruthless one. When it comes down to it, the best players don’t care about duty, honor or accomplishments. They only care about how many mechs you can field and how hard it is to dislodge you from power. Even between liege lord and vassal, relations are frosty to the point where they won’t hesitate to stab each other in the back when they can get away with such an act."
All of this neatly explained the cynical decision-making of the nobles who ruled the various demesnes of the Vesia Kingdom. The more Ves heard the details, the more he grew confused. "I don’t understand. How can this mutual lack of trust even work? The more you explain it to me, the more I think of the Kingdom as an unwilling collection of selfish Houses."
"Ah, but that’s exactly why the Kingdom still stands! Relations, connections, favors and rules all prop up its stability, but only at the surface. Underneath it all, friends can turn into enemies on a dime, favors can easily be forgotten and only the victors make the rules. The fundamental basis that allows a House to stand on their own is whether they possess the power to defend what is theirs. Newly enfeoffed nobles are often met with a rude awakening when they are first introduced in the ways the powerful play the game."
The sordid way the Kingdom ran its power plays made perverse sense to Ves, but he still couldn’t quite adjust his mentality around this reality. "If every Vesian yields in front of the Vandals when they are coming to raid them, what stops us from taking advantage of it?"
"Oh, this is only because the Vandals are currently in the inner reaches of the Kingdom. Normally, these well-off territories are protected by the peripheral and border territories, so they never had to deal with any foreign raids. It’s different at the border system. At first, these poor and struggling border systems yielded without a fight when the Vandals came to steal their riches. After doing it once, don’t you think the Vandals will do it again?"
"So the Vandals actually took advantage of this?"
"Yup, up until the border systems wised up. Letting the Vandals treat them as their personal bank account was just encouraging them to suck all of their wealth away. Once they wised up and banded together, the Vandals could no longer roll over an under-defended star system. No matter how badly they were outnumbered, the garrison forces always fought as if their lives depended on it. This deterred the Vandals from raiding their systems with regularity."
It was much like how a bully pushed around someone weak for the first time. If the victim acquiesced to the bully and let them do whatever they wanted, the bully would just keep coming back and push even harder. Only by standing up would the bully have to contemplate whether it was worth it to push the victim again.
Evidently, the border systems had all become jaded enough to learn that they should never let anything go for free. Compared to the tough border systems, the star systems in the core territories of the Kingdom hadn’t learned this lesson yet. They continued to obsess over their closest rivals and dismissed the threat of the Vandals!
Even though Ves had a lot of misgivings about this situation, he sobered up enough to take advantage of the lack of opposition. He helped guide the Vandals in picking out the best locations to raid. He felt like a kid entering the biggest toy store in the galaxy with an unlimited credit balance. The only limitation that restricted him from robbing the whole place blind was time.
They didn’t have enough time. Even with the lack of fighting, they still couldn’t afford to stick around for long before reinforcements arrived. Fortunately, the Hachew System wasn’t close to any military strongholds.
After some time, Major Verle came to ask him a question. "Since we aren’t facing any opposition in this raid, we are gathering much more goods than we projected. Will it be sufficient to meet all of our needs?"
Ves shook his head. "Far from it, sir. The stockpiles we are obtaining are very much needed, but they don’t come in enough volume. I’d say we can only meet eighty percent of our current needs, and that is only with regards to these specific materials. We need other metals and compounds to round out our other needs. All in all, our supply situation looks a lot better now, but it’s far from perfect."
"Hm. Once we are out of this star system, we’ll be conducting a trade with the Venidse Liberators. I hope we can obtain some of what we need from them. It’s going to be our only trade until we cross into Klein or Hafner."
They wouldn’t trade much but the bare essentials, Ves knew. After a bit more talk, the major turned his attention to other matters, leaving Ves free to direct the raiding Vandals into pillaging more goods.
It felt rather strange for him to wield such power. Though the Vandals only treated his directions as suggestions, they placed so much faith in his judgement that he might as well be commanding them directly. His every decision decided whether a business survived or fell in this ordeal.
Sometimes, Ves had the illusion that he was playing god.
He didn’t feel particularly guilty in ruining the Vesian businesses. Their states were at war, after all, and stripping and destroying each other’s industries was as common as drinking water.
Perhaps this was what a proper raid looked like. Ves only had the botched Imodris Raid on the Mech Nursery and the Detemen Operation to go on. In both cases, the attackers and defenders fought with conviction. Here, Hachew III didn’t even wait for the first blow to arrive before it collapsed.
Ves found the experience to be oddly hollow. There was a break in tradition. An imperfection in an otherwise perfect image. There should have been more fighting before they obtained their prize.
Was the Vesia Kingdom really so weak? The way the nobles distrusted each other practically weakened their state by half.
He would never want to live in this confusing and contradictory state. The Bright Republic might not be perfect, but Ves gained a new appreciation of how sane it was being run.
After an entire day of peaceful ransacking, their landbound mechs packed everything up and entered their combat carriers, which slowly ascended into space. Laden with much-needed resources and supplies, the invigorated Vandals leisurely disappeared from the hairs of House Sabanet after transitioning into FTL at a Lagrange point.
Despite fearing the might of Venidse’s mech legions, the Vandals had seen neither hair nor hide of their formidable ships or mechs.
The effortless raid on the Hachew System allowed them to replenish some of their critical resources and supplies, but it also exposed their position to the entire Kingdom. As a powerful duchy on par with Imodris, Venidse could not afford to leave an impression that they would let any enemy walk over them at their leisure.
From the intelligence reports that Ves sometimes received, he understood that the shameful procession at Hachew had really kicked Venidse into action. They sent out much more scouts and leveraged more vassals into making more than a token attempt at obeying their instructions.
Considering what he knew about their relations, that wasn’t saying much. The Duke of Venidse was pretty much on his own, and that allowed the Venidse Liberators to run rings around his intelligence gathering operation.
Unlike the Detemen League, the Venidse Liberators spanned more than just a single planet. The general undercurrent among the underclass in Vendise was so dissatisfied with House Venidse that they had a presence in virtually every star system in the territory.
Their reach, clout and numbers gave them a certain amount of strength. Their cells accumulated a fair amount of ships and mechs that had proven themselves to be a real nuisance to Venidse. Their nuisance factor was compounded by the fact that the Liberators weren’t stupid enough to fight Venidse’s mech legions in open combat.
Instead, they stuck to classic insurgency tactics and fought where Venidse was at their weakest. Ves admired their prudence. Even as they grew in strength, they didn’t let their power get ahead of themselves, but continued to bide their time until the arrived at the right moment.
Under the guidance of the Vesian Liberation Front and the Venidse Liberators, they arrived at another quiet star system to conduct their trade. Lieutenant Commander Soapstone spearheaded the transaction with the Liberators while Iris Jupiter tagged along to represent the interests of the VLF. Ves was explicitly excluded from contacting the rebels due to his special status.
He didn’t really mind. After a while, one rebel group was the same as any other. Ves had already given his input on the goods they urgently needed to obtain. Soapstone had not been entirely clear about her commitment to fulfill his wishlist. She probably had her own priorities in mind, and needed to fulfill the needs of other departments as well.
Mechs were important, but the ships also needed repairs. Their cracked and pitted armor still bore the scars of recent missile and mine impacts. Some of their less robust combat carriers didn’t have much of a buffer left.
As the Vandal fleet floated motionlessly in space next to a rebel trade convoy, Ves spent his time on making the rounds. He rode a spare shuttle to visit the Antecedent, the Gorgon’s Gaze, the Finmoth Regal, the Beggar’s Bounty and every other important ship.
Each visit, he would meet with the mech designer assigned to ship and check up on their work. Though Ves had a pretty good idea of their results from the reports he received, he found it best to verify their work first-hand and ask some pertinent questions.
The lower-ranked mech designers mostly took the opportunity to ask some questions, and since Ves felt a bit generous today, he casually gifted them with a couple of insightful pointers.
When Ves visited Vedette aboard the Finmoth Regal, the timid low-ranking mech designer seemed to get his act together. Though the mech technicians obviously didn’t respect a wimp, Vedette managed to instill the impression that Ves backed his every move. Defying Vedette was the same as defying Ves, and no one wished to do the latter.
Ves applauded his junior’s solution and clapped his back. "It’s not as good as earning the rabble’s respect, but at least you’re getting there. If the mech technicians give you any lip, don’t hesitate to give me a call. The thing about borrowing someone else’s name is that you have to be sure that they’re willing to back you up. Right now, you’re an extension of my will, so it’s a given that I’ll help you out."
"Thank you, sir. I was hesitating whether I was doing the right thing, but I’m glad I have your permission." Vedette nodded in gratitude.
"This is only a stopgap solution though. You need to earn their fear or respect. I can’t help you much there, but from my experience showing off your superior knowledge always works."
"That’s easier said than done, Mr. Larkinson." Vedette smiled ruefully. "Although I can call myself a mech designer, I am but an ant compared to you. The gulf between is too wide for me to catch up."
"You don’t need to reach my level to instill some appreciation from the techs. Just work on it and you will see."
"That’s the problem. I know some stuff, but not enough to impress the Vandals."
"Then learn some more!" Ves clapped Vedette’s back again. "Have you forgotten about the rewards I’ve dangled in front of you?"
"It’s too challenging! I’m barely meeting my weekly quota, and I don’t have the spare time to catch up on my studies. I appreciate the option to borrow a textbook from the central database, but the reading material is too opaque! Even with half a year, I still won’t understand the essence of what they are trying to teach!"
Ves sighed in exasperation. "Doesn’t the central database have beginner books? Maybe you should start with that instead. Don’t chew off more than you can bite."
"That seems like a waste, sir. Those beginner books for Novices are so simple that I understand ninety percent of what they say."
"That’s sad, Mr. Vedette." Ves shook his head as if he was a disappointed parent. "A mech designer of your age and level should understand the entire contents of a basic book. That ten percent you are struggling with is needed to make sense of more advanced knowledge. What I’m trying to say is that you shouldn’t put the cart before the horse."
That put Vedette to thought. It was difficult for him to admit he needed to shore up his fundamentals, but that was for him to overcome. Ves didn’t have the time to waste on guiding Vedette to the right path.
Frankly, Vedette didn’t look all that bright, but if there was one thing that Ves didn’t worry about, it was talent.
He would rather recruit a talentless but earnest mech designer to a talented but scheming bastard. In fact, Vedette happened to tick most of the boxes that Ves was after. His junior in the craft possessed so little self-esteem that Ves relished in molding the man into his desired image.
It was much like constructing an image for a mech, in a way. Instead of working with metals and alloys, he was trying to manipulate an innocent being of flesh and blood.
Sometimes, Ves felt guilty about his interactions with the weak. It was as if he was brainwashing them into forms that pleased him more. He quickly soothed his conscience by convincing himself that he was merely talking to them instead of sticking a neural interface on their heads and force fed their brains with arbitrary rules.
A handful of other low-ranking mech designers proved pliable, though they lacked that special reverence towards him that made it easier to pull them into his orbit.
The only mech designers he would rather avoid were Mercator and Trozin. The former never resigned himself to losing against Ves, and had stirred up trouble more than once.
The worst instance so far was his attempt to blame the fiasco and the bombings at the Finmoth Regal to Ves. Nevermind that Mercator was supposed to keep an eye on Vedette. As the ultimate mech designer responsible for the entire procession, Ves held ultimate responsibility.
"Did you hear? Our head designer dropped the ball! If he was actually smart, he would have caught wind of what went on at the Finmoth Regal!"
"Mr. Larkinson is only the head designer because of his famous family name. If he was called by any other name, he wouldn’t have been promoted to this high status."
All of that led to a number of sordid rumors among the lower ranks that collectively cast some shade on him. While they didn’t inconvenience Ves so far, he still felt peeved that he gained an ambivalent reputation.
Of his two main rivals for his job, Ves regarded Emlanin Trozin with a bit more wariness. Iris always treated the female Apprentice Mech Designer as a snake in the grass. While Ves did not pay much attention to Trozin these last few days, he began to realize that may have been the point.
Not one for letting things fester, Ves paid more attention when he boarded her ship. As soon as the security checks and the ceremonies were dispensed with, Ves pulled Trozin into the nearest available conference room.
"If I may ask, sir, why did you seek me out?" She started, eying Ves with a wary expression. "I have work to do. I’m sure you don’t want to deal with more delays."
"Just wait a moment, Miss Trozin." Ves held up his hand. "Work is important, but communicating with each other is also something which must be done. Ever since my field promotion was set in stone, I haven’t heard much from you. From the latest reports, you’ve delivered no more than what is required."
"Meeting the quota is a significant burden." She replied. "I’ve compared my quotas to others and I’ve noticed that you’ve piled a lot more demands on my shoulders. It is taking me every waking moment to figure out a workable solution. In addition, I have to supervise a bunch of talentless mech designers as well!"
"It is not my intention to crush you under so many responsibilities! In fact, I was pretty certain that a mech designer with your capabilities would grow into the demands I’ve set upon you."
"We are just different mech designers, sir! What you find eay is an impossible challenge to me!"
Was Trozin telling the truth. Ves thought he had gauged his deputies pretty well. He couldn’t determine whether Trozin was pulling off a trick or not. In the absence of any evidence, Ves had no choice but to believe she genuinely couldn’t keep up.
"What is it about the work that you are having trouble with? As I recall, your record states that you specialize in kinetic weapons."
"Correct. Back in the Hellcat design team, I was one of the few mech designers that fully understood their nail drivers. I excel in working with weapons. As for mech frames, not so much."
"That sounds as if you are an equipment designer rather than a mech designer."
"My career is what it is." She shrugged. "I’m catching up with my studies. Ah, I have access to my own books. I don’t need your help."
"You have family among the Vandals as well, I take it. Is Captain Branser stationed at the Wolf Mother your uncle?"
"He is, though we’re not in touch right now."
Trozin refused to elaborate on the matter. Ves found it hard to probe the woman and gain a measure of her personality. She stonewalled him at every opportunity, and it went so bad that Ves couldn’t figure out where she studied or why she had been assigned to the Vandals instead of a better mech regiment. THe records Ves recently accessed only extended up to a point.
Ves sighed and rubbed his eyes. "Okay. Leaving aside your work, do you need some help? Is there anything you want to pass on to me?"
Her eyes seemed to glow at him. "There is one question that’s been nagging me all this while. I wonder if you are willing to tell me truth."
"As long as it doesn’t touch into classified territory, I’m more than willing to answer your question."
"Good, because this one has been consuming me ever since we left the Detemen System." Trozin took a deep breath before she faced Ves. "Tell me this, is our task force playing the role of bait to the Vesians?"
Trozin’s question came out of the blue. This wasn’t the first time Ves heard something like this. One thing about the Flagrant Vandals was that they incessantly chatted about topics that ordinarily shouldn’t be discussed. Besides strictly classified material, everything was fair game.
Her question echoed the concerns of many Vandals assigned to the Verle Task Force. Why did the main fleet split in two, and why had Colonel Lowenfield gathered all of their best assets to the fleet that fled in the direction of home?
The Verle Task Force could have fled to the Bright Republic ass well after taking a small detour. In fact, their chances of making it through hostile space was significantly higher if the main fleet reconvened. Splitting their strength at this junction only allowed the Vesians to defeat them in detail.
If nobody questioned this dubious progression, then the Vandals were too stupid to live.
From his occasional inspections, he gathered that the Vandals among the task force felt a bit ambivalent about their supposed mission. The Reinald Republic was a non-entity in their eyes. If the Bright Republic wanted to make contact with Reinald, then they could have sent a simple courier on a roundabout path.
Thus, the most popular theories that circulated among the rank and file attempted to explain this situation.
The first theory was that during the Detemen Operation, the Detemen League hadn’t taken their most important captive with them. Instead, Lord Javier of House Eniqqin had actually been handed over to the Flagrant Vandals, who kept this important noble captive within their midst!
If this was true, then they truly carried a hot potato. Count Loqer would never rest while his only natural heir slipped out of his grasp! He would surely wield his influence into intensifying the search for the slippery Vandals.
The second theory that made the rounds was that Colonel Lowenfield or someone higher up the chain of command cold-heartedly cast them off as a distraction to the furious Vesians. If the Vandals fled in a single cohesive fleet, not only would their size make it harder for them to hide, they would also attract an inordinate amount of attention.
Halving their concentration reduced their threat profile because it made it harder for them to raid well-defended star systems along their escape path. This gave some reassurance to the Vesians and lowered their priority to chase the Vandals down. As long as their interests weren’t threatened, they had little reason to commit to the hunt.
Although this sounded like a good outcome, it also made it easier for the Vandals to suffer a defeat. If not for the split, the Vandals would never sustain such exaggerated losses against two mech companies of the Calico Dancer Bats.
The Verle Task Force walked a dangerous path right now. Compared to the diminished main fleet that included Colonel Lowenfield, the Wolf Mother, their remaining Senior and Journeyman Mech Designers and more, Ves and Trozin had the illusion that they’d been orphaned.
Of course, even if the Vandals heartlessly decided to write them off, Ves couldn’t give in to the cynicism. "I can’t answer your question. Even if I knew, there’s no reason for me to clear up your confusion. No matter the intentions of the brass, it’s not our job to concern ourselves with whatever strategies the Vandals are cooking up."
"Sir, I can’t accept that answer." She said in a terse manner. "I’ve heard that you’re close to the major. Surely you must have figured out a hint or two."
"Just drop it, Miss Trozin. No matter what our true mission is, our opinions won’t make a difference. Our actions will. Do your work to the best of your ability in order to maximize our chances of survival."
It took some time for Trozin to accept the fact that Ves wouldn’t tell her anything. They quickly ended their discussion after that. Since Ves lost his mood to talk, he took an immediate shuttle ride back to the Shield of Hispania.
After the Flagrant Vandals and the Venidse Liberators finished their trade, the two fleets separated from each other and went their separate ways. The Vandals quickly transitioned into FTL as soon as the coast was clear.
The new materials the Liberators traded to the Vandals increased the pace of the ongoing repairs. Many critical shortages had temporarily been addressed, but it wouldn’t take long for this abundance to end. The Vandals withheld much of their valuable loot and only let go of the absolute minimum.
They still aimed to bring the valuables they obtained in the Detemen System to the Reinald Republic where they could expect to exchange them for fair market prices.
The difference between selling the loot to the rebels and selling it at a neutral market amounted to at least fifty billion credits! That sum alone wiped off a fourth of their debt burden!
No matter what, they couldn’t let go of such a juicy prize. Even if their mechs and ships began to run ragged, the Vandals still hated to let go of so much credits. Some would even die for the Vandals to succeed!
More mechs received repairs. They temporarily decided to halt the restoration of the landbound mechs in favor of restoring their spaceborn combat capabilities. During the previous skirmish, a lot of Inheritors sustained damage.
The new materials allowed the mech technicians to begin with implementing more drastic repairs. Heavily-damaged or outright wrecked specimens of Inheritor mechs required a significant amount of resources to replace what wasn’t there anymore.
Space combat had a tendency to fling debris and broken parts across light-years. Complete recovery of every piece of salvage couldn’t be done on the battlefield. Besides, the Vandals had been in a hurry back then, so they didn’t bother retrieving anything but the bare essentials.
This left the task force with a fair amount of partially-intact Inheritor mechs. As the light skirmisher model boasted fairly thin armor, the damage these mechs sustained often amounted to serious internal damage. Lost limbs and holes that ran through the entire frame was not an uncommon sight.
Compared to the mechs that only fried their internals, these seriously-damaged mechs required much more materials to supplement their losses.
Ves spent a fair amount of time to plan out the repairs. Over fifty heavily-damaged Inheritor mech frames each exhibited different battle wounds. Normal procedure would have been to delegate the repair plans to the mech designers on site, but Ves decided to draw up the plans himself due to his superior ability.
By making the plans himself, he prevented his incompetent subordinates from fumbling through the repair process and waste an inordinate amount of resources and time.
The work happened to stimulate him. Each individual mech was a unique creation. Though they all drew upon the same Inheritor design, months or years of continued use had let to the proliferation of small divergences and minor idiosyncrasies.
"Every mech is unique. The older they are, the more they take on their own life."
From a professional standpoint, this was a natural but not entirely welcome development. Each mech differed in small ways as mech pilots sought out the closest mech designers at hand to request modest tweaks and modifications to cater to their individual piloting style.
Mech pilots ordinarily stuck to their assigned mechs for years. This constant and continued use of the same mech by the same pilot inevitably led to a divergence in their evolution.
The reason why this wasn’t a desirable development was that it made it harder to implement global upgrades to the design. It also complicated mass repair work. The Vandals worked with a fleet of fairly aged mechs, each of which had gone through three or more rounds of modification.
This meant that to repair these individual works, they each required their own tailor-made repair plan. If clueless mech technicians decided to apply standard upgrades, then the chances of introducing faults magnified to an unacceptable level.
The design of the Inheritor was exceedingly complex for such a cheap mech. It incorporated many nuances that Ves didn’t entirely understand. Nonetheless, out of every mech designer in the task force, Ves tentatively believed his understanding of the design exceeded others by a wide margin. Thus, he straightforwardly snatched this task from the hands of his subordinates and returned with complete repair plans only a day later.
Out of every Skill that helped, Ves had to thank his Jury-Rigging Sub-Skill the most. The knowledge provided by this Sub-Skill enabled him to find substitutes to more expensive materials. In essence, it allowed him to do less with more. Although his makeshift solutions cut a lot of corners, the damaged Inheritors should at least be able to last long enough to reach the end of this mission.
Everything seemed to go well since they entered Venidse. The large and industrious duchy boasted lots of star systems, of which Venidse invested only a fraction of their wealth to inhabit them. If Venidse wanted to find their trace, they faced the same difficulty as finding a needle in a haystack.
With the Venidse Liberators covering their back, the Vandals received some assurances of their safe passage. Ves heard some rumors in the corridors that one of the reasons why the Vandals allowed themselves to be ripped off in their recent trade was to increase their reward for performing this service for the task force.
After all, the relations between the different rebel groups and the Flagrant Vandals looked like a mixed bag. The Vandals had a much better relationships with the rebel groups that operated close to the border between the Bright Republic and Vesia Kingdom.
Now that they crossed over to the other side of the Kingdom, the Vandals pretty much traveled through uncharted territory for them. They had never come into contact with the Venidse Liberators before. If not for the introduction and mediation by the Vesian Revolutionary Front, the Vandals would have been forced to fight through countless mechs in order to cross through their territory.
Still, extending their trust to complete strangers had their downsides. Just as they arrived near the border between Venidse and Klein, the task force emerged into a tiny star system that wasn’t as desolate as they thought.
The first signs of something wrong was when the alarms blared throughout the entire fleet! Explosive shells thundered out of nowhere and detonated against the engines of several important ships!
They were under attack!
"Everyone get to battle stations!"
"No signs of enemy mechs or ships in the vicinity!"
"We are being hit by close-ranged shells! Our assailants are in stealth!"
"Deploy anti-stealth measures!"
Over seven ships simultaneously incurred substantial damage to their thrusters and engines. Two more ships sustained heavy damage to their engineering bays. Besides felling a substantial amount of engineers, the shells also managed to damage the outer housing of their all-important FTL drives!
Without any FTL, they could forget about escape!
The moment the alarms blasted against their ears, Ves and Iris looked at each other with panic and immediately changed into their hazards suits. After his previous ordeals, Ves made a habit out of cramming in a couple of emergency supplies in his cabin and workplace.
This came incredibly handy at this moment as it took barely a minute for them to become enclosed in protective armor.
Though they looked rather goofy, the rest of the Vandals adjusted their outer appearances as well. Decompression, lethal radiation and intensive temperature fluctuations all possessed enough harm to snuff out their lives if they gathered in strength.
The spacers aboard the Shield of Hispania largely didn’t bother wearing anything bulky. They largely adorned their own brand of vacsuits that didn’t hinder their precision work. In exchange, their suits only protected them from a certain level of damage.
Ves daydreamed about cladding himself with the most superior armor as he stepped inside the command center and took his usual seat. Only half of the console operators arrived so far. The inconvenient timing made it clear that this attack was preordained.
"What happened?"
"Stealth mechs are attacking our mechs! They don’t have the firepower to destroy on of our ships, so instead they are attempting to sabotage our mobility!"
The war raged on. The fighting at the frontlines showed signs of subsiding. As predicted by the Republic, the Vesian aggressors began to run out of steam. Pushing into the Republic’s territory expended most of their supplies. Casualties began to pile up, and the burden of maintaining a presence on the captured border systems slowly added up.
Further incursions happened now and then, but the Mech Corps constantly mobilized more divisions to the front. The Bright Republic may have started the war on the back foot, but hey quickly showed their mettle once their mech divisions accumulated in sufficient numbers to match their Vesian counterparts.
The events surrounding the Flagrant Vandals impacted the see-saw battles in a profound way. Not only did the Vesians started to lose heart a little faster than projected, they also seemed to show signs of sending some of their forces back in order to join the manhunt for the two Vandal fleets.
In the end, they stayed put. They couldn’t afford to waste away the opening invasion. The Vesian strategists knew that they needed to secure as much star systems as possible. The more star systems they conquered, the more they benefited from the added depth.
While the adventures of the Flagrant Vandals excited the Republic, the public eventually dismissed them as a sideshow. The real war was fought along the border of these two irreconcilable states. In that, the major trend hadn’t diverged too much from everyone’s expectations.
Melkor Larkinson read through the headlines published by all of the usual mouthpieces of the Republic and smiled sardonically. "Heh, if I really believe this crap, I’d be a fool."
According to the articles put out by the state, the Mech Corps inflicted heavy losses to the Mech Legion. For every mech the Republic lost, the Kingdom lost at least two mechs.
This was pure fantasy. While Melkor never fought in the war before, just like Ves he learned much from his uncles and aunts. One of their most important lessons was to disregard everyone’s claims about how good or bad the Vesians fought. In all the ways that mattered, the Mech Corps and the Mech Legion pretty much matched each other in military prowess.
The Mech Legion boasted higher numbers as the Vesia Kingdom was blessed with a bit more space and population than their rival state. That said, their unity and coordination suffered enormously because every individual mech legion was controlled by the duchy that raised them from their own efforts.
No single war leader possessed the authority to direct the entire Mech Legion. That required the mutual respect and trust from every duchy in their notoriously fractured state.
For example, if a war leader sought to ingratiate themselves with Imodris, Venidse would immediately halt any cooperation. To Venidse, empowering Imodris was worse than letting the Bright Republic off the hook. If necessary, Venidse would pull back all of their mech legions from the front in order to exert pressure on Imodris.
The periodic wars against the Bright Republic was pretty much a game to the nobles. In addition, centuries of deepening enmity between the states had driven the Vesian populace in a rabid frenzy against the Republic.
While the nobles played their games against each other, the commoners largely remained ignorant to their power struggles. In fact, the nobles didn’t like it when the commoners became inured in their dirty laundry. They would rather direct their sheep to pay attention elsewhere.
The war against the Bright Republic formed a convenient way for the nobles to direct the energy of their commoners at. Many people in the Republic believed that the only reason the nobles tentatively fought alongside each other at the frontlines and committed so much military might was because they couldn’t afford an extended period of peace.
The prevalence of rebel groups in their interior already spoke of the massive amount of discontent that was building up among their lower classes. While it seemed paradoxical for the Vesians to channel their best fighting forces towards fighting a foreign enemy rather than first cleaning house, the latter had proven to be supremely ineffective.
Rebels popped out all the time. With the way the nobles generally ran things, they would never be able to eradicate the scourge of insurrections. Like rats, each time the nobles painstakingly put down a single cell, two more cells would spring up elsewhere.
Only through waging a massive war against their bogeymen would the nobles be able to stir up everyone’s patriotism and be able to deflect their attention from their own suffering.
Though it sounded like a precarious balance to maintain, the Vesians pretty much mastered the art of turning the Bright Republic into their bogeyman.
"Do the Vesians even want to win this war?"
Plenty of conspiracy theories circulated among both sides of the border. The wars between the two states had been so static that people couldn’t help but think that both states played their own game with each other.
Still, no matter the truth, war was not a game, and plenty of people died during each and every outburst of violence.
Perhaps the only way the Vesia Kingdom might actually be able to win the war was if the royal family gained enough power to command the loyalty of the entire Mech Legion. In practice, this had never happened in their entire history except during the founding of both states.
By now, the royal family pretty much turned into figureheads for the Kingdom. Though they grasped as much power as any duchy if not more, they suffered from the combined suppression of every duchy under their rule.
In other words, they had become hostages to their own vassals!
This was a profoundly ironic circumstance in the history of the Kingdom considering the original intentions of its founder. The original founder of the Kingdom wanted to wield absolute power and rule over his state as their sole tyrant. This was why he adopted the feudal system in the first place.
It was a pity that his trusted subordinates who had been assigned as his dukes didn’t necessarily agree. Though relations between the founding generation had been clear, once the subsequent generations grew into power, they began to chafe at their restrictions.
Eventually, the power wielded by the royals eroded to such an extent that they long since lost the influence to change the course of their entire state.
As the bogeymen of the Vesians, the Bright Republic wasn’t as demonic as the commoners of the Kingdom thought. They styled themselves as a bastion of reason and rationality. Though they suffered from their own power struggles, it hadn’t reached the self-cannibalizing state of their mortal enemies.
The Mech Corps was a consummate professional organization that largely steered away from the tribalism of the Mech Legion. While the commanders of the mech divisions still regarded themselves as rulers of their individual forces, they were very much aware that they didn’t own the mech forces they commanded.
The Mech Corps funded almost every mech division from a centralized source. Frequent exchanges and transfers of funding, technology and personnel kept the mech divisions from becoming too isolated.
This allowed the Mech Corps to exert more effective military strength despite constantly being outnumbered by their Vesian counterparts. High command was not an illusion, and their individual forces actually followed their strategic planning.
Their coordination grew more potent with the addition of competent intelligence. The Bright Republic ran some of the more effective military intelligence operations. They easily exploited the divided nature of the Vesians and excelled in gathering critical intelligence. Sometimes, they even stole exclusive technology specifications before the Vesians had even begun to implement them in their own troops.
Nonetheless, the Bright Republic constantly teetered at the edge of defeat during each war. It was their conflict to lose. While the Vesians consistently hammered their defenses in the same one-dimensional offensives as before, the Mech Corps constantly needed to exert their full efforts just to place themselves on par with the Mech Legion.
It wasn’t fair. The Vesians weren’t actually putting their full effort in the war, yet they could easily push the frontlines if they exerted a little more effort on occasion.
Sadly, war was never fair. All it cared for was who had the biggest fist.
One of the main reasons the invasion stalled wasn’t because the Vesians exhausted their men or ran out of supplies. It was actually because the nobles that held sway in the frontlines lost the heart to push through the turtle-like Republic.
"It’s getting harder and harder to achieve a breakthrough. The hateful Republic is only focused on defending!"
"It’s such a pain to sacrifice so many mechs to gain control over another dinky star system. The annual tax revenue of this star system isn’t enough to fill the gap between my teeth!"
"I’m tired. Let’s stop for a few months and go at it again when we are better prepared."
Of course, the desires of the nobles clashed against the professional soldiers who fought the actual battles. They deeply wanted to push through and defeat their rivals once and for all.
The differences in opinion changed nothing. In the Vesia Kingdom, the nobles held all the sway. If they all agreed to stop the offensive, then the push into Republic space would certainly stall.
Meanwhile, the Verle Task Force met with their latest crisis. The sudden sneak attack stank of a Venidse ambush. Every Vandal grew serious once the implications settled in their minds.
Surprisingly, rather than initiating combat with the Vandals with a large number of mechs, Venidse instead opted to begin their attack with an attack from stealth!
The Flagrant Vandals constantly maintained their vigilance each time they emerged out of FTL. This time was no different as up to a hundred spaceborn mechs deployed from the ships at any any time except when it was time to go.
The entire attack interval only lasted a couple of seconds. The stealth mechs that perpetrated the attacks obviously didn’t wish to stick around long enough for the Vandals grasp their locations.
Major Verle only arrived at the command center half a minute later than Ves and Iris. Despite his relative tardiness, he quickly grasped their actual situation and issued the right commands.
"Deploy the dust! As much as you can!"
"Order our mech patrols to comb through their quadrant of space! Any suspicious signs and signals should be reported immediately!"
Every Vandal ship immediately threw out vast clouds of dust. Like the particle grenades that the rebels once deployed in Neron City, the dust clouds acted as a proven low-tech solution to skulking stealth mechs.
The only problem was that the expanding dust cloud showed nothing suspicious. Not a single area in the expandings clouds deformed!
"H-How is this possible?!" Major Verle gritted his teeth. He instantly turned to Ves. "Explain!"
Ves felt the intensity of the major’s gaze. "Modern stealth technology has derived countless ways to circumvent such a crude detection method. Venidse excels in developing stealth mechs. They would have certainly tried to plug this obvious hole to their ability to remain hidden!"
"Fine then! If the dust cloud doesn’t work, then let us pump out more ordnance into our perimeter!"
Akkara mechs started firing lasers into empty space. Missiles launched from their few missile-bearing mechs and exploded at predetermined coordinates. Nothing worked. Within a range of fifty kilometers, there didn’t appear to be any enemies!
Everyone’s faces grew ugly. Even Ves began to sour as his own search attempts accomplished nothing. He had to hand it to Venidse, they really mastered the use of stealth technology.
All of this left the task force frustrated, rattled and crippled. At the very least, this star system didn’t appear to host any follow-up forces.
Their main concerns turned from stopping any further attacks from stealth to repairing their extensive battle damage.
Seven ships lost their sublight propulsion. This was not as big of a problem as it sounded. The real concern was that their vitally important logistics ships lost their FTL drives. Without this vitally important component, they couldn’t run away!
The hidden assailants caught the Flagrant Vandals completely off-guard! Their premeditated attack not only immobilized seven important ships, but they also went a step further and damaged the FTL drives of their logistics ships!
With the Beggar’s Bounty and the Linever Swan unable to flee from this star system, the entire task force turned into a sitting duck! If they couldn’t get those FTL drives back online, they faced two very stark choices.
Either give up the logistics ships and force the rest to flee into FTL, or make a stand and attempt to restore their FTL functionality!
A matter of such import would be a bit awkward for Major Verle to decide upon alone. Therefore, he opened a communications channel to the Antecedent in order to connect with their fleet commander.
Ves had met with Captain Argil Rakeshir a couple of times during staff meetings. The man was a typical old salt with distinct spaceborn sentimentalities, though he kept that part of himself locked away when he met with others.
As the captain of the Antecedent, Rakeshir kept a very low profile. Nonetheless, he held the most seniority out of the ship captains and therefore took on the role of the task force’s fleet commander. As such, he was usually the ultimate authority when it came to ships and fleet actions. Captain Rakeshir basically translated Major Verle’s orders into concrete maneuvers.
"How bad is it, Rakeshir?" Verle asked. This time, he hadn’t bothered to summon a privacy screen.
"Really bad." The fleet commander grimaced. "We can work on restoring our propulsion at our leisure once we dive into FTL, but the Beggar’s Bounty and the Linever Swan are dead in the water. Not only that, they’ve lost at least half of their engineers, so any repair works will face significant delays."
"Give me an estimate. How long will it take to restore their FTL drives?"
"The good news is that we’ve got spares. The bad news is that they’ve been calibrated for combat carriers, not logistics ships. We can slap them onto the Beggar’s Bounty and Linever Swan in an emergency, but it will take hours to configure the ships and the FTL drives. You may not know this, but the latter comes with an extremely stringent safety lock. There are too many ways for FTL travel to go awry, so unless everything is in tip-top shape, the drives won’t engage."
This prevented shenanigans such as capital ships attempting to transition into FTL with a tiny drive meant for corvettes. Any misconfiguration led to catastrophic effects. Therefore, FTL drive designers always erred on the side of caution and incorporated a very extensive safety check.
"How long exactly?"
"I can’t give you an exact estimate. At best, eight hours, at worst, sixteen hours. This is already at our most extreme. Installing incompatible FTL drives onto damaged ships requires weeks of configuration if we want to do it properly."
"This is a time for haste, not caution. Sixteen hours is already too long. Venidse may arrive at any hour."
The captain shrugged. "This is the best our engineers can accomplish. It’s impossible for them to cut anymore corners. Even now there is a substantial risk that the hasty repairs will turn out to be botched. You don’t want to see the result of the aftermath of such an event."
Major Verle and Captain Rakeshir argued about this point for several minutes. No matter what Verle said, Rakeshir couldn’t give them a better time frame for the repairs.
"Alright, do what you want, as long as you make it quick." Major Verle replied in an exasperated tone. "Since half of our ships lost their sublight propulsion, is there any way to get our fleet moving? If Venidse has sent a follow-up force after us, they’ll be homing in on these coordinates. We won’t be able to defend ourselves as well if they drop right on top of us!"
Captain Rakeshir frowned. "There is no practical way to get our ships moving. Our undamaged ships lack the propulsion to tow away our damaged ships. While I’ve already prioritized the restoration of their propulsion systems, they actually need a lot more time to restore because the material damage is very extensive."
This must have been Venidse’s strategy from the start. They focused the bulk of their firepower in penetrating deep into the Beggar’s Bounty and the Linever Swan to anchor the Vandals to this star system. They then swept half-a-dozen combat carriers to paralyze their in-system maneuvers!
If not for their allegiance, Ves would have applauded Venidse! With just a single attack, they set the entire task force in a deepening spiral of doom!
"Can we utilize our mechs to help to tow the ships?" Verle suggested.
"Impossible! A combat carrier is unimaginably heavy! Even with hundreds of mechs, we don’t have the cables to support them all. This move is only viable if the ship being towed is as small as a frigate or corvette."
There went that idea.
Major Verle ended the call after determining there was no way they could regain their mobility in the short-term. For better or worse, the task force continued to drift through space at the exact same pace, allowing any ambushers to calculate their position at any given time.
This level of exposure made the Vandals very uncomfortable. Part of their modus operandi was to stay unseen as they skulked behind enemy lines. They never fought upfront if they had the choice. In fact, unless they stood to gain a lot of wealth, they wouldn’t hesitate run with their tails tucked between their legs.
This was their definition characteristic as a raiding unit. They stole what they could and ran whenever they met an opponent.
The only problem right now was that they couldn’t run at all. Their legs had sustained damage and it would take approximately eight hours at minimum for it to heal. Until then, any enemy could come up to them and beat them black and blue.
Having listened to the high-level discussion, Ves knew that they had decided to commit to a turtling strategy. Neither Verle nor Rakeshir contemplated the option of abandoning the two logistics ships.
Though they contributed little in actual engagements, their true value lay in their ability to process ores and raw materials. They also formed miniature factories that fabricated and restored batches of mechs by the dozens.
Therefore, even if it seemed that evacuating and scuttling the logistics ships guaranteed a safe retreat, their subsequent situation only became more precarious over time. By the time they crossed into Hafner, all of their combat carriers might have exhausted all of their remaining resource stockpiles.
Times like these reinforced the limited power of a mech designer. Even vaunted Master Mech Designers such as Master Olson or Master Katzenberg had to resign themselves to the inevitable if they faced the same situation.
There might be a possibility that they dabbled in FTL theory. Ordinarily, mech designers never encroached upon starships, while ship engineers never involved themselves with mechs. While ships and mechs shared much in common, they exhibited a lot more differences. Mastering either of them required a lifetime’s worth of study and dedication.
Understanding FTL drives was already an extremely high task for ship engineers. Only the most seasoned chief engineers among the Vandals possessed the bare qualifications to work with the drives.
If Ves forcefully tried to help, he would only make things worse as he possessed no foundation in FTL technology at all. "Let alone FTL technology, I don’t even have a proper foundation in starship engineering."
He felt awful for being so useless at the moment. Every Vandal felt likewise, and they all prayed that their chief engineers got the newly-installed FTL drives to work again.
In the meantime, Major Verle tasked Ves with helping their mechs with setting up an anti-stealth perimeter. They never caught the stealthed assailants, so the possibility of another attack was very high.
Ves felt that he was lacking yet again in this matter. Venidse’s stealth technology was a notch ahead of anything else he had encountered. Whereas other forms of stealth could be broken by throwing dust at them, Venidse had obviously developed specific countermeasures that insured their stealth forces blended in seamlessly in the most chaotic environments.
Breaking their stealth required more than a light puff of dust.
Obviously, Ves couldn’t do much on his own, so he drew in Iris, Mercator and Trozin for support.
"Comb over the logs and try to pin down how Venidse ambushed us. Understanding how they snuck up on us is the first step in preventing a repeat of the same attack."
With those words, he left the three to do their own research. In the meantime, he helped the Vandals set up their mech patrols in a way that maximized their stealth detection. Each mech carried different sensor models, and some were more suited for anti-stealth than others.
Compensating for the extreme effectiveness of Venidse’s stealth systems, Ves basically fixed the smallest detection ranges for every individual mech model. At those conservative ranges, it mattered little how well the enemy hid their traces.
For the worst mechs, this range did not surpass fifty meters, while the best mechs only boasted an effective detection radius of only two-hundred meters.
In the scale of landbound mech combat, those distances amounted to a couple of footsteps. In the scale of spaceborn mech combat, those distances were equivalent to two humans standing only centimeters away from each other.
The detection ranges was far too short to cover the entire task force!
He contacted Major Verle. "Sir, I have a problem to report."
"I’m busy, Mr. Larkinson, so this better be good."
Ves briefly explained the dilemma with the detection ranges. "Our fleet formation is too dispersed. Every ship is maintaining a distance of several kilometers away from each other. While I can understand the logic for assuming such a large minimum distance, our circumstances have changed. If you want full coverage against stealth infiltration, then we need to contract our formation."
A monumental decision like this directly affected their survival. Verle’s frown only grew deeper as Ves burdened him with another concern.
"Have you identified how Venidse got the drop on us?"
"My men are working on it, sir. So far, we haven’t turned up any results, which means Venidse has employed some new breakthroughs. It is possible that we won’t be able to find any records of their latest advancements."
Verle nodded in understanding. "Even at the frontlines, Venidse never shows their hand too often. They cherish their elite stealth units. The more Venidse makes use of them, the more the Mech Corps is able to understand their underlying principles and develop a counter for them. Since your mech haven’t found an immediate match, it is unlikely you’ll found anything relevant in the database."
"I was afraid of that, sir. I’ll still let my subordinates to continue their research. Who knows if they can figure out a clue. About the issue I brought up, have you made a decision?"
"Not yet. I’ll need to bring it up to Captain Rakeshir. If he thinks the risk of collision or getting caught in an area effect is smaller than the risk of suffering another close-ranged stealth attack, then I don’t see a major problem in contracting our formation."
Ves could not decide this issue for them. He dared not overrule Captain Rakeshir when it came to controlling ships. He had already done his due diligence by informing them of this vulnerability and providing them with an option to address the holes in their defense.
In the end, their paranoia overruled their common sense. Having failed to detect their initial attackers, Major Verle and Captain Rakeshir feared their enemy would grow bold and go for a reprise.
Several minutes later, every ship received orders to converge into a tighter formation. Ships with working propulsion helped get the immobilized vessels into the right position and heading by towing them one by one.
Slowly, the Vandals adopted the stance of a turtle.
Hours went by as the Flagrant Vandals contracted their defenses and turtled up. Conventionally, starships tried to maintain a distance of at least five kilometers from each other. This rule of thumb varied from state to state and from star sector to star sector, but generally speaking it was unthinkable for ships to stray closer than a kilometer to each other.
There was no reason to do so. If ships needed to transfer passengers or goods to each other, they only needed to let their shuttles or transports do the work. These smaller spacecraft flew fast enough that a distance of one kilometer or ten kilometers didn’t matter very much. The launch and docking maneuvers alone took up a lot more time than the brief trips.
Machines always posed a risk to their environment. If anything went wrong, their immediate surroundings came under threat. This didn’t matter too much if it concerned an aircar. At best, it would crash against something and kill a couple of people.
When mechs malfunctioned or went rogue, it could do a lot more damage. A critical explosion may even take out half a city block in the process, though such an outcome was very rare these days.
More concerning was when something as large as a combat carrier suffered a disaster. Their power reactors outputted so much energy that they could easily power several mech companies without a sweat. If all of that energy ended up in the wrong destinations, the combat carrier could easily explode with the fury of a miniature nuclear warhead.
This was only one worry fleet commanders had to deal with when they drew up their formations. Many other concerns led to the convention that ships generally avoided sticking too close to each other.
The only reason why Major Verle and Captain Rakeshir went against their screaming instincts was because they genuinely feared a repeat of the attack that crippled the task force’s mobility.
Now, they stood a fair chance of detecting any hidden approaches in the immediate vicinity. Inheritors and other light mechs formed the main line of defense against their hidden opponent. All of them entered into a spherical formation that provided overlapping detection coverage in every angle.
Their medium mechs on the other hand patrolled the outer perimeter. Their inferior sensors couldn’t be used to sweep up stealthed enemies, but they were mainly there to defend against overt attacks and to catch any stealth units that attempted to flee after another successful attack.
In this way, they posed a certain level of deterrence.
"Boss! We’ve figured out how Venidse snuck up on us!"
Ves turned around to Iris. "Explain."
She summoned up a projection of a sensor recording. "This is the rear-facing sensor of the Beggar’s Bounty immediately before the attack. Visually, there is nothing present. Only after a weapon is launched are we able to detect a minor disturbance. Through hours of painstaking research, we’ve finally been able to define the silhouette of the stealth unit that attacked us."
"Doesn’t this look rather... small?"
Their attacker appeared to be a half-sized mech. It was severely undersized compared to what he expected, especially since their attacker employed an instant burst of firepower deadly enough to penetrate through several layers of ship armor.
Granted, the stern of a starship was always their most vulnerable facing. The thrusters and other systems that occupied the rear end of the ship couldn’t operate if too much armor obstructed their functioning.
Even then, a mech that was substantially smaller than a light mech shouldn’t have been able to inflict so much damage.
"Do you think this is a mech?" She asked.
Now that he thought about it, the silhouette didn’t match any mech that he could recognize. It kind of looked like unbalanced shuttle married with an oversized weapon mount.
"This isn’t a mech. This is a commando shuttle!"
"That’s what our consensus has led to as well. Stealth is harder to maintain on bigger vehicles than smaller vehicles. It would make sense to employ a shuttle instead of a mech if the latter isn’t needed. The only thing that is strange about this silhouette is that a very large torpedo tube is welded onto its hull. And yes, Venidse employed ultra-short ranged torpedoes against us. Each of them packed enough explosive power to tear through our ships."
Iris calmly explained the traits of the commando shuttle and backed up her inferences with sporadic evidence. Though much of it remained guesswork, Ves believed her assertions.
"I see how this can work for Venidse." Ves nodded. "Instead of endangering their precious mech pilots, they can apply their same superior brand of stealth to disposable shuttles. Slapping a torpedo mount on them is sheer genius. It wouldn’t work on a regular shuttle, but a stealth shuttle has no problems getting up close."
The threat level of commando shuttles could not match the threat level of stealth mechs. Unlike shuttles, mechs possessed a lot more flexibility. Who knew what weapons or gadgets they brought if Venidse sent them to this star system.
Once Major Verle received the files, he finally started smiling again for the first time in hours. "Good work, Mr. Larkinson! At least someone scored some results. That’s more than I can say for the rest!"
The Beggar’s Bounty and the Linever Swan both required a lot more hours before they regained some of their space worthiness. Every ship engineer aboard the other ships had converged to the two cripples logistics ships in order to lend a hand with restoring their FTL capabilities. This was an extraordinary collaboration that left the engineering departments of the other ships dangerously thin.
Ves politely smiled back at the commanding officer. "We live to serve."
Iris softly bumped her elbow against his ribs. She probably built up some resentment when Ves failed to credit their contribution.
Once Major Verle turned away to adjust their defensive envelope to cope with the commando shuttles, Ves turned back to Iris.
"Right now, Verle only wants to hear results. I’ll mention all of your accomplishments in the after-action report."
Of course, Ves planned to do no such thing, because that would be giving more kudos to his deputies. At best, he could push all of the credit to Iris, not that she needed it all that much since she was technically a guest designer.
That made Ves question her continued presence in their midst. Their journey was fraught with peril. Pretty much the entire Kingdom was out to kill them. For Iris to continue to accompany them meant that there must be a profound reason why she stuck around.
One possibility was that she had been assigned to the task force for the same reason Colonel Lowenfield split up the main fleet. They’d been cast out as bait and were never expected to return. Maybe the Vesian Revolutionary Front arranged her demise.
Another possibility was that their mission mattered more than Ves initially thought. For whatever reason the task force needed to reach the Reinald Republic within two months, the outcome of this mission might have far-reaching effects.
Personally, Ves was partial to the second possibility. It conformed to his growing suspicion that the events at Detemen IV only served as the prelude of a greater undertaking.
It could be that Trozin’s conspiracy theory was on the right track, only that it swapped the bait.
Rather than assuming that the Verle Task Force served as bait, perhaps it was more accurate to state that the main fleet took on this role!
The logic behind this assumption sounded a little dubious, but Ves couldn’t discount this possibility.
"The main fleet brought all the attention-grabbing assets with them. With the Wolf Mother, Professor Velten, the Journeyman Mech Designers, and Colonel Lowenfield herself as high-value assets, she turned the main fleet into a priority target that must be destroyed at all costs."
Taking down even one of them could serve as a massive propaganda victory for the Vesians. Whenever Ves browsed the galactic net in order to keep track of the main fleet’s attempts to return to the Republic, the news surroundings their passing outnumbered the interest to the Verle Task Force.
Could it be that Lord Javier was actually imprisoned inside one of their ships, and that for some reason he needed to be brought to the Reinald Republic on a time-sensitive basis?
Ves imagined himself being flung into a deep dark ocean with very little visibility. The more he fumbled around, the more he bumped into shadows of creatures and objects, some of which posed a significant threat to his life.
He faced two different choices in this situation.
One choice would be to remain passive and stop his underwater thrashing. This minimized the risk of bumping into something threatening, but this also left him blind to any incoming threats. The downside to being passive was that Ves had to submit to fate to make it through.
The riskier choice would be to become more active and start to swim about. Whether he would be met with fortune or calamity, Ves didn’t know, but it sounded better than leaving his survival to fate.
He made a decision then. If they survived this crisis, he vowed to get to the bottom of this mission. It was way too risky and inexplicable for Ves to believe that this mission was anything routine.
"This is a matter to consider for later."
Right now, they needed to wait for something to change. Either the two logistics ships regained their FTL functionality, or Venidse would finally reveal their fangs.
Unfortunately for him, the latter happened first.
Midway into the restoration process, a squadron of ships emerged out of FTL.
"Detecting eight unknown vessels!"
The new ships consisted of four combat carriers and four inconsequential transports. Everyone ignored the transports and focused on the combat carriers. Upon emerging from FTL, they regained their bearings quickly and immediately begun to approach the stranded Vandals.
It would take only half an hour for the newcomers to come into combat range.
"Identify the ships!"
"We’ve matched their visual appearances to ships of the 1st Frosty Meteors of the 6th Venidse Mech Legion!"
The majority of the Vandals in the command center reacted strongly after the sensor officer mentioned the Frosty Meteors.
The Frosty Meteors was one of Venidse’s premier spaceborn mech regiments! As their moniker alluded to, they didn’t tend to play around. Instead, they relied solely on force to crush their opposition!
They favored melee mechs and ranged mechs in equal measure. Their melee mechs acted as cavalry that relied on their powerful charge to smash apart their opposition. Their ranged mechs mostly consisted of gun platforms that unleashed a massive amount of firepower at medium range.
Worse, the Frosty Meteors enjoyed the best funding from Venidse, allowing them to field a substantial amount of heavy mechs. From heavy cannoneers that could outgun the Akkara, to heavy knights that could endure a mech company’s worth of firepower, everything about the Frosty Meteors inspired dread.
Naturally, everything had a cost. The Frosty Meteors was a money pit. It cost Venidse a significant amount of wealth and resources to maintain this prestigious unit.
Their second and more relevant weakness to the Vandals was that all of their mechs were rather slow. Certainly, if their enemies let them build up a charge, then they could be very fast, but their actual acceleration was very sluggish.
If the Flagrant Vandals retained their mobility, then there was no question that they would be able to outrace the lumbering Meteors.
It was a pity that half of their ships lost their sublight propulsion. While a turtle may not be able to catch up to a hare, there was no question that it could catch up to it when it was crippled.
"Damn!" Major Verle slammed his fist against his armrest as he beheld the approaching might of the Frosty Meteors. Even though the four combat carriers could only field four mech companies at most, their quality was more than sufficient to smash their immobile fleet!
Chapter 543
The Frosty Meteors immediately showed their intentions when they emerged from FTL . They approached the stranded Vandal task force at full burn without any hesitation!
Their arrogance knew no bounds! Conservatively, they would be outnumbered at least three-to-one, yet they showed no signs of slowing down!
The most prudent decision to make from Venidse's perspective was to wait for other friendly elements to catch up . After all, taking on the task force with only four spaceborn mech companies left them with very little margin for error .
The unspoken message behind their brazen course of action came as a slap to the faces of the Vandals! The Frosty Meteors obviously thought little of their opponents!
To be honest, Ves couldn't blame them for viewing the Flagrant Vandals with contempt . The two mech regiments differed largely in purpose, funding, tradition and fighting ability .
A raiding regiment such as the Flagrant Vandals mainly relied on their mobility to attack when they were strong and flee when they were weak . This was their main advantage, but also their fatal weak point . The moment when their mobility became hindered, they lost almost all of their advantages .
It was pretty much the opposite for the Frosty Meteors . Almost every fighting attribute reached an extreme . As a medium to heavy cavalry regiment, they leaned more towards the use of hefty armor . Every mech of the Meteors was at least twice as resilient as an equivalent Vandal mech . This difference alone gave the Venidse mech regiment a decisive advantage!
Everyone in the command center could tell how serious a threat they faced . Nobody belittled the Frosty Meteors for their arrogance or their lacking numbers . The Meteors proved their mettle many times in the frontlines of the previous wars . Slow they may be, even the most premier mech regiments of the Mech Corps abhorred getting into a slugging match with the Meteors .
After venting his fury, Major Verle opened a private channel to Ves . "What is your analysis as a mech designer . Will our mechs be able to withstand the Meteors?"
"I don't rate our chances high . " Ves responded despondently . "With half of our fleet unable to move, we are forced to fight on their terms . The Meteors love nothing more than to bash themselves against soft targets like us . Neither the Inheritor or the Hellcat will be able to turn the tide . The only variable that I can't account for is how many heavy mechs they brought . Each heavy mech is an enormously difficult rock to crack . If they brought more than twenty heavy mechs, we basically stand no chance at all unless we adopt a clever tactic . "
Ves knew his mechs, but even his perspective contained holes . The one element that Ves couldn't predict was the effect of different formations and tactics . Depending on how well the Flagrant Vandals and the Frosty Meteors employed their formations, the outcome of the battle might very well swing drastically in one direction or another!
Therefore, even if everything appeared hopeless, Ves did not give in to despair .
"Can we employ our landbound mechs to enhance our strength?"
"It's very difficult . " Ves shook his head . Ves had seen such a drastic desperation move many times in action dramas . What worked in the dramas didn't necessarily work in reality . "Our landbound mechs aren't able to maneuver in space at all . They'll be sitting ducks against the enemy ranged mechs . There's also recoil and heat management to consider . "
Mechs with ballistic weapons especially suffered from recoil . Each time these mechs fired their weapons, they would spin their entire frames like a wheel .
As for heat management, landbound mechs reliant on high-heat weapons such as laser rifles relied a lot on heat convection to shunt away their excess waste energy . Since there wasn't any air or solid ground in space, such mechs wouldn't be able to get rid of their heat fast enough!
"Is there no other option?"
"There is one I can think of, but it's rather silly . Just as how we employ our landbound Akkara heavy cannoneers as an improvised turret, we can make use of other landbound ranged mechs in a similar fashion by strapping them against the hull of our ships . "
Such a tactic fell in the category of desperation move as well . While it came with a lot of malpractices, it had been used often enough during the Age of Mechs to be regarded as a viable way to leverage a mech force's otherwise useless landbound mech force in space .
Affixing the landbound mechs onto the hulls of their ships neatly solved their heat and recoil problems . The only problem for the Vandals was that it took a lot of time and manpower to set up . With the Frosty Meteors less than thirty minutes away, they wouldn't be able to affix more than a dozen or so mechs onto the hulls of their combat carriers .
Major Verle must have thought the same . "I've already considered this option . It is extremely ruinous for the landbound mechs because they have lost all of their mobility . Besides, if we want to employ all of our ranged mechs into ad-hoc turrets, we need several hours of preparation time . "
Venidse timed their surprise attack fairly well . Only a couple of hours after they immobilized the Vandals, the Frosty Meteors arrived to deliver the coup-de-grace! Though it sounded simple, to plan and time such an outcome required extremely strong prediction capabilities on the part of the enemy!
They certainly faced a formidable opponent right now! Not only did they come with strength, they also showed an excellent level of coordination!
This was bad news for the Vandals because even if they fought back hard against the Meteors, they also had to worry about stealth attacks . This invisible threat constantly hovered over the heads of the Vandals . The moment the Vandals broke up their anti-stealth formation, their invisible opponents would have free reign to deliver another crippling blow to the task force!
Ves and Major Verle swapped a few more ideas, but none of them sounded promising . In the meantime the clock continued to tick . A few minutes into their burn, the enemy combat carriers finally launched their mechs .
A hundred-and-forty mechs launched in quick succession . As expected, the Frosty Meteors employed an even mix of ranged and melee mechs .
Their medium melee mechs carried a substantial amount of armor . Much of them consisted of space knights, which made them even more resilient as a whole .
Their ranged mechs on the other hand consisted entirely of ballistic weaponry . The Frosty Meteors famously eschewed laser weaponry because they preferred the tactile feedback of kinetic and explosive shells . Their rifleman mechs exclusively made use of heavy caliber rifles, while their cannoneers used even heavier barrels for maximum firepower .
What caused Ves and the others to despair was that the Frosty Meteors boldly displayed twenty heavy mechs . Half of them consisted of heavy space knights while the other half consisted of heavy weapon platforms akin to a spaceborn variant to the Vandal Akkara model .
Each and every mech model employed by the Frosty Meteors was state of the art . There was no question that the Frosty Meteors brought their best . This was no collection of rank-and-file elements like the previous appearance of the Calico Dancer Bats .
The Frosty Meteors basically believed that this battle was in the bag . No matter how much the Flagrant Vandals flailed, they couldn't change the outcome of the battle . It was a given that they would lose . The only question was by how much .
If the Vandals closed ranks, they risked total annihilation or capture . On the other hand, if the Vandals evacuated the immobilized ships and hurriedly ran away in their few undamaged ships, they might be able to run away before the enemy caught up .
Major Verle immediately shook his head when Ves suggested to cut off their tail and run . "We can't discount the enemy stealth units . Whether its shuttles or mechs that are lurking in the vicinity, both can easily hinder our transition into FTL by throwing out disposable gravitic mines in the surrounding area . This is one of Venidse's favorite tactics . "
Even if they hadn't spotted any signs of enemy stealth units so far, Verle had no choice but to assume the worst . It might be that the Vandals overestimated Venidse's commitment and worked on false assumptions, but they truly couldn't afford to make a misjudgement at this time .
"The transports are emitting water!"
This was another tradition of the Frosty Meteors . The transports didn't carry any goods or supplies . Instead, their cargo holds had been converted into water tanks . Immediately before they entered into battle, the transports expelled their water from the tanks and allowed them to flash freeze in space, creating makeshift ice meteors .
Once the tanks ran out of water, the heavy knights accompanied by a handful of medium mechs maneuvered behind the meteors and began to push them forward using their powerful flight systems . Though this slowed down their overall approach, they also gained a shield of some sorts . If the Vandals wanted to damage the charging Meteors, they first needed to chip away at all of the ice in their way .
Just as Ves wanted to raise the option of splitting up the Vandal ships, Verle suddenly turned his head towards another private channel . For the first time since the Frosty Meteors emerged from FTL, he grinned .
"Mr . Larkinson, it seems we still have a lifeline . Venerable O'Callahan has decided to deploy into battle . "
Major Verle didn't hide his words this time . Everyone in the command center heard his words . Upon mentioning the expert pilot, everyone instantly lifted their gloom! Some even outright laughed as they thought that Venerable O'Callahan would single-handedly be able to turn the tide!
Ves had never witnessed O'Callahan in action . From the archival footage that he perused in his spare time, he had to admit that O'Callahan might do well against the Frosty Meteors . The only problem was that O'Callahan would never be able to finish off all hundred-and-forty mechs on his own before they crashed into the rest of the Vandals .
Battle couldn't be avoided . They just had to go about it in a smart fashion . As long as O'Callahan and the regular Vandals worked together, they might be able to pull off a miracle .
Major Verle didn't need his advice on this matter . He probably knew much more on how to employ his mechs than Ves, so the channel immediately closed .
Several minutes passed by as the Vandals prepared for battle . Not only did they need to guard against any stealth ambushes, they also had to commit enough mechs to support O'Callahan's counterattack . This required a lot of judgement . If they committed too few mechs on either demands, then they risked a fatal flaw .
The wait was agonizing to Ves . RIght now, he couldn't do much except to uncover more details about the enemy mech models . He had no illusion that he would be able to find a critical weak point in their excellent designs .
Fifteen minutes until the Frosty Meteors arrived, the Parallax Star finally launched from the Gorgon's Gaze . As he witnessed the resplendent lancer mech take to the stage, Ves withheld his enthusiasm . While others showed their awe at the presence of their resident expert pilot, Ves felt some contempt at the Venerable .
Iris noticed his disaffection . "Why so glum, boss? We might be saved!"
"Hmph . The only reason why he dragged his corpse out of his hibernation chamber is because the Gorgon's Gaze is one of the ships that lost their sub-light propulsion . If not for that, he would probably be the first person to suggest we split and run . The Venerable is selfish to the bone . "
It was a given that Venerable O'Callahan needed to expend a significant portion of his remaining vitality into the upcoming battle . If not for their hopeless situation, the stingy death-fearing old expert pilot would never use up his precious lifespan .
Even as the rest of the Vandals experienced a lift in morale, Ves crossed his arms and in expectation . The Vandals sacrificed a lot of resources to put O'Callahan on retainer . The expert should better reciprocate this time .
"Show us what you can do . "
Among mech pilots, expert pilots occupied a special place. Often likened as demigods, these experts display inhumanly good skill in piloting mechs.
Every basic parameter concerning piloting received an overall boost. From battle sense, weapon accuracy, resilience, willpower and more, any expert pilot was able to beat ten advanced pilots without any effort if they all piloted the same mechs. In some cases, their best attributes even surpassed the human limit.
Therefore, people considered every expert pilot to be an elite by definition.
However, this was not enough to elevate experts into objects of worship. The true worth of an expert pilot was that their cognition experienced a specific mutation that opened them up to resonance.
This wasn't the fake resonance that mostly relied on passive exotics and a little helping of mental compulsion from a customized neural interface. The resonance that expert pilots could call upon was at least ten times stronger, and each could achieve a much greater variety of effects.
This was what true resonance looked like. It was the power that elevated expert pilots into heroes on the battlefield, and enabled them to fight a hundred enemy mechs by themselves.
"An expert pilot is a one-man killing machine. Where one treads, hundreds of mechs will fall apart. Entire regiments despair when an enemy expert pilot stares at them. Sometimes, a grueling battle has been made irrelevant due to the outcome of a duel between experts."
Of course, such sayings left out a host of factors. Not every expert pilot and expert mech was the same. Nonetheless, even the weakest expert possessed a level of strength that was almost impossible to overcome by any other mech pilot.
Befitting of their status as demigods, the life of an expert pilot was filled with difficulties. No expert pilot came about from greenhouses. Not even the MTA or the first-rate superstates could reliably engender expert pilots among their ranks. They all came about by chance, though good genetics sometimes played a role.
In any case, nobody could predict whether a potentate was destined to advance to the rank of expert pilot. They could come from descendents of a small military dynasty such as the Larkinsons or emerge from the underclass of an overcrowded city.
As long as enough mech pilots received the opportunity to pilot a mech, their hidden talents would inevitably emerge. However, this happened only when the mech pilots received enough stimulation. Heated combat and the threat of death was the simplest and most effective to draw out an expert candidate's potential.
The amount of expert pilots that emerged from the battlefield vastly outnumbered their counterparts from the dueling arenas. This was the strongest proof that to raise an expert pilot, lots of mech pilots needed to be thrown into a conflict.
The more mech pilots entered battle, the higher the odds of uncovering an expert pilot. Some people say this was the principle reason why war was still so prevalent throughout human space. If states didn't wage war against other states, they often tended to wage war against themselves. No matter where anyone turned in human space, there was always a fight to be found.
No one succeeded in fostering a specific mech pilot into a vaunted expert. Many have boasted the ability to do so, but most training programs simply aimed to push their mech pilots to their limits.
It wasn't uncommon for the training programs to turn deadly.
The only way for states to foster expert pilots was to play the lottery enough times. An extremely low probability event almost always delivered no results, but if it was repeated many times, then eventually the jackpot would fall.
Each expert pilot that fought for a state added to their overall strength. Yet even then, the advancement of an expert pilot had only just begun.
Beyond their current rank existed even more powerful existences called ace pilots, and that was not the end.
Beyond ace pilots, a rare crop of mech pilots had attained power unimaginable. So much so that people couldn't help but call them god pilots.
Only several hundred god pilots existed in the galaxy. They were just as rare as Star Designers, and both enjoyed a similar status in human space.
The only difference was that Star Designers generally transcended human division and employed their apex abilities for the betterment of the human race as a whole.
God pilots on the other hand remained more willful for some reason. While some join Star Designers into declaring neutrality, others have decided to remain attached to either the Greater Terran United Federation or the New Rubarth Empire. No other state possessed the appetite to retain a god pilot.
Even if they had been declared as divinity in human form, god pilots still hungered for what lay beyond. None of them had ever advanced to the rank after god pilot, but all of them sensed a vast fog of possibilities. In their pursuit to surpass their god-like existences, these peerless warriors believed that they could only reach a greater height through continued struggle.
Rixt O'Callahan was no god. Right now, he could be called a demigod as best, and a decrepit one as that. With one foot in the grave, his body had long lost the fitness of his sprier years. If nobody knew that he was an expert pilot, they might mistake him as a walking corpse!
Yet no matter how awful his body looked, it still retained a large portion of its inner strength. It was generally known that the mind of an expert pilot had broken the shackles of the human limit. What others might not be aware of was that their physiology also followed suit.
Though expert pilots generally didn't bother training their bodies to a superhuman level, they did sought out treatments and medicines that strengthened their flesh in order to endure the physical demands of piloting a mech.
Thus, even as O'Callahan emerged from his hibernation chamber, he only needed a couple of minutes to return to his peak state. After apprising himself to the current conditions of the Vandals, O'Callahan immediately entered the cockpit of his personal steed, the Parallax Star.
This wasn't his first expert mech. Having lived for over a century, O'Callahan often piloted the best of what a state could offer to their precious experts. A champion without the finest armor and weapons would never live up to their potential.
He still remembered his first mech, so long ago. When he was still an advanced pilot, he was assigned to a mech regiment of the Mech Corps that fielded lancer mechs.
Back then, everything was simple.
"I was so young and stupid back then." The Venerable sighed as he boarded his exquisite mech. "How could I know that I needed to cherish my life?"
In truth, O'Callahan hated the Parallax Star. It did not match the grandeur of the mechs that accompanied him before. Those mechs were true beauties designed by multiple Seniors in collaboration. None of those machines failed to disappoint. Some even approached the quality of mastercrafted mechs.
That was a long time ago, when his skin was still smooth and when his hair still glistened in the light.
As he spoke a silent prayer, he begged whatever higher powers that may exist to spare his life some of his lifespan. Though he used to be an atheist during much of his life, when the onset of death came ever closer, he started to seek refuge in faith.
"How pathetic. I used to be a model citizen from the Bright Republic as well. What will my publicists think when they hear me praying to the heavens?"
That was a thing of the past. Now, his value had fallen to such an extent that he had to resort to joining the Flagrant Vandals to remain relevant. None of the other mech regiments agreed to his demands.
"How short-sighted of them! Even if my resonance strength is far from my peak, I'm still strong enough to be a terror on the battlefield!"
The magnificence of his youth and strongest years invigorated his old bones. His strong sense of confidence asserted itself, and as the Parallax Star finally launched into space, he cast aside all distractions.
"Come, my Parallax Star. Even if you are the weakest steed that I ever had the privilege to pilot, you are still a thoroughbred! Show me your strength!"
The aged expert pilot turned deaf against the mech officers that attempted to pass on instructions to his ears. He blinded himself against the glut of information being displayed on his consoles. The Venerable completely invested himself into melding himself with the Parallax Star.
The custom mech coated in burgundy and black and embellished with gold started to brandish its lance and power up its flight system. In a single instant, the expert mech flung itself away from the Gorgon's Gaze.
Soon, it bypassed the anti-stealth formation. Its exclusive flight systems accelerated the Parallax Star onwards. The two rod-like wings affixed to the rear of the mech glowed as hot as stars. Their radiance blended together, giving the mech the illusion that it was burning like a star.
The rest Vandals scrambled to response to Venerable O'Callahan's unilateral approach. Major Verle originally intended for the Parallax Star to keep pace with the Vandal mechs. Now, all those plans had to be thrown out the window.
A large portion of spaceborn mechs separated from the stranded Vandal fleet and hurried after radiant lancer mech. The Vandals only retained enough Inheritor mechs to maintain a contracted detection envelope.
When the Frosty Meteors initially saw O'Callahan's approach, they laughed. Had the robber regiment gone crazy?
Then, the mechs started picking up peculiar sensor readings. Not only did the mech accelerate faster than any normal mech ought to, they also detected the faint but unmistakable signs of true resonance.
"It's an expert pilot!"
"T-T-Thirty laveres!"
"Who is it! What mech is it!?"
"No idea, sir! The mech isn't on our records! All we know is that it's a lancer mech!"
The Frosty Meteors ran a search on all Brighter lancer mech pilots with a projected strength of thirty laveres. They quickly came across a fossil in their search results.
"Venerable O'Callahan? Hasn't that sack of bones bit the dust yet? I can't imagine he's still alive!"
"Even if he clings to his life up to now, it won't take more than a bump to push him into his grave. Let us help him give him the rest that he deserves!"
Lesser mech pilots despaired when an enemy expert pilot showed up. Not so for the Frosty Meteors. As elites, they have encountered many crises in battle. The appearance of an unexpected Venerable failed to impact their morale.
It was unfortunate that they hadn't brought an expert pilot of their own. They didn't even know the enemy task force carried one, since Venerable O'Callahan hardly deployed into battle since he signed up with the Vandals.
To the Frosty Meteors, the entry of an enemy expert pilot only formed a minor hiccup. At most, they had to scrap their initial battle plan in order to accommodate the unusual abilities of the incoming expert.
Despite the vast distance separating the Frosty Meteors from Venerable O'Callahan, the latter seemed to sense the contempt directed against him. "Bastards! Don't ignore me!"
His mech glowed even brighter as he started to push beyond the limits of what his mind, body and mech could withstand. The resonance that accelerated his mech beyond its regular limit grew stronger, and the glow surrounding the Parallax Star started to extend towards the lance, enveloping it in a strange energy field.
The Parallax Star expended a massive amount of power just from its initial approach. It was an extravagant waste of energy that no clear-minded mech pilot wished to throw away.
O'Callahan wasn't in his right mind at the moment. The naked contempt of the Vesian mechs in front of him engulfed his mind with fury. Nobody affronted his pride as an expert pilot and got away with it! Frosty Meteors or not, everything fell before his lance!
"Come, Parallax Star! Charge as hard as you can!"
The distance between the two closed within minutes. The Frosty Meteors long adjusted their formation into a half-sphere. They might not be able to stop the initial charge, but they believed that they could easily strike down the expert mech after it lost its momentum.
"Brace yourselves! Here it comes!"
Chapter 545
The Frosty Meteors employed a number of iconic mech designs . Famed for their durable medium and heavy mechs, each of their designs served as a fine example of their types .
Their prestige mech was undoubtedly the Kenas Oliphant, their heavy space knight . Clad with thick and heavy layers of armor, it had also been paired with fairly powerful flight systems, which gave it a respectable amount of acceleration .
Armed with a sword and tower shield that was even thicker than its chest armor, a single Kenas Oliphant represented a pinnacle in defense . With the help of its flight system, the Kenas Oliphant was also able to keep up with a charging formation .
If the Kenas Oliphant charged into the Flagrant Vandals with its shield held in front, there was no question that the latter would buckle . The impact might even be strong enough to disintegrate a Hellcat!
That wasn't bad enough . The Frosty Meteors brought more . With ten Oliphants charging forth with a disposable ice mass serving as their first line of defense, there was no question that the heavy mechs could smash through even the sturdiest Vandal lines .
There was too much disparity between the two forces . Heavy mechs might be expensive and not very cost-effective compared to the lighter weight classes . Some even argued that they were wasteful toys . In general, to build a single heavy mech ate up the resources of at least three to five medium mechs .
This wouldn't be bad if heavy mechs performed three to five times better than lighter mechs, but the truth was that their specs hardly doubled . Several parameters remained the same, while others such as agility and speed suffered a severe slide . These weaknesses sometimes enabled agile light mechs to dismantle heavy mechs that cost ten times as much with ease .
Nonetheless, heavy mechs served as a powerful singular package on the battlefield . Whether a mech contributed to victory or defeat was the only criterium that mattered .
Against the charge of the Parallax Star, none of the mech pilots of the Kenas Oliphant panicked . Not only did their mechs benefit from an improvised ice shield, their mechs also boasted over alternating alloy formulas .
Their armor system consisted of a sandwich of different alloys . The main protective alloys came in the form of compressed armor while the other alloys only served to absorb shock and thermal energy, thereby eschewing expensive compression treatment .
It was a wonderfully effective and intricate armor system that required weeks of fabrication work just to produce a complete set . It was also fairly affordable for the level of protection it afforded . If not for its propensity for faults, it would have been more widespread .
This armor system was perfect for the Kenas Oliphant because the Frosty Meteors possessed an ample amount of funding, more than enough to cope with the low success rate . Every Kenas Oliphant was a product of hard work and excellent craftsmanship . None of these heavy space knights ever left the production lines in a less than perfect state .
"Give me an Oliphant, and I will tear through the Republic!"
As the standard bearer of the Frosty Meteors, the Kenas Oliphant model carried the hopes and dreams of the Frosty Meteors . Rarely did they falter . Only their best knight pilots received the privilege of piloting a prestige mech, and they knew the parameters of the Oliphant like the back of their hand .
Every pilot of the Oliphant fought with courage, but more importantly they fought with clarity . They had been trained to recognize the signs that the Oliphant neared its breaking point, upon which they would pull back before the mech pulled back before it could break .
This led to an excellent track record over the years since it had been adopted by the Frosty Meteors for this current war . Everyone expected it to emulate its predecessors in the mech regiment .
It should never fall in battle . The only acceptable reason for it to face defeat was if the Frosty Meteors encountered a vastly superior enemy force and needed to retreat in a hurry . They could forgive the Oliphant for being too slow to keep up with a retreat . It was a mech that had been designed to be an unbreakable bulwark or an unstoppable forward vanguard after all . Stepping back was not in its job description .
Yet of all the enemies the Oliphant had been built to withstand, its designers could never account for the myriad of wonders that expert pilots embodied .
"The instant the glowing Parallax Star hit the ice shield, it immediately broke apart before the energy field . The expert mech encountered virtually no obstruction until the tip of its energy field along the lance touched upon the Kenas Oliphant's tower shield .
"Parallax Star! PIERCE FOR ME!"
Propelled by fury and the glory of old, Venerable O'Callahan dauntlessly charged into the heavy knight without any hesitation . He deliberately picked the staunchest and most durable mech of the Frosty Meteors as the beginning of this baptism of fire .
The tower shield, which could withstand the firepower of an entire company of ranged mechs for a significant amount of time, melted before the energy field and broke upon impacting with the tip of the lance . The hole in the shield expanded from a pinprick into a giant cavity that bisected the durable object!
That wasn't all! Just a split-second had passed while the shield gave way before the invincible lance . The Parallax Star hardly lost its momentum and continued to drive its weapon forward!
The lance drove onwards until the energy field and the the physical lance point dug into the chest of the Kenas Oliphant and brute-forced its way through the alternating layers of armor . No matter how many plates was in the way, all yielded before the incredible momentum and unyielding supernatural force of the Parallax Star!
"Charge! Charge without fear! Charge until the ends of the galaxy!"
The lance dug through the most durable mech in the lineup of the Meteors as if it was made out of cloth . An incredibly expensive and incredibly powerful mech lost twenty percent of its torso mass right then and there . Even worse, the incredible kinetic impact and the corrosively hot energy field burned through the heavy space knight's more vulnerable internals . No matter how hardened the internals had been built, all of it had been friend, including its heavily fortified cockpit!
Its highly-trained mech pilot never had the chance to eject! Even before she recognized the imminent crisis, the lance's energy field already burned through the cockpit's protective cover and seared the pilot's body into carbon and ash!
The entire miracle seemed to take forever, but in actuality the Parallax Star had punched through the Kenas Oliphant without any halt . While the impact slowed its momentum, it only lost twenty percent of its peak! Venerale O'Callahan still had enough juice to continue the charge!
"No matter how many mechs I have to knock down, my mech will never falter!"
The Parallax Star might have slowed down a bit, but the glowing lancer mech was still a blur to others . Even Ves couldn't distinguish between the Parallax Star and an asteroid dropping from orbit .
Only the most highly-trained mech pilots among them possessed the cognitive perception to follow the Parallax Star's incredible progress . This was why the second mech in the line fired its rifle straight at the approaching expert mech .
The rifleman mech was a copy of the Caca Similas, an important ballistic rifleman mech of the Frosty Meteors . It wielded a heavy ballistic rifle which could fire both shells and kinetic projectiles of incredible force . The rifleman mech opted for a solid kinetic projectile, as the Parallax Star's incredibly fast approach would only make the impact worse .
It was the right choice to make, but it didn't make any difference this time . Just as the projectile spun into the Parallax Star's chest, the projectile made out of sharp and dense alloys splintered apart like fragile wood before the energy field!
The pilot of the Caca Similas barely had enough time to panic, let alone command his mech to dodge . Even with his brain revolving faster than ever before in his life, his mech simply didn't possess enough reaction speed to make any further moves! Even though the Vesian pilot mentally commanded his mech to eject, it still took at least five-hundred milliseconds for the cockpit to begin its blastoff!
That delay might as well be an eternity in this situation! The force of nature that was the Parallax Star eventually punched through the Caca Similas with even greater ease than before! After all, a rifleman mech could never match the toughness of a heavy space knight!
Even if the Frosty Meteors prioritized the durability of the Caca Similas, which was unusual for rifleman mech, it didn't make any difference before the Parallax Star!
O'Callahan's mech lost a further five percent of its forward momentum, which was fairly neglibile to him . Sadly for him, no other mech floated in its way!
The Frosty Meteors utilized a broad and shallow half-sphere formation that held very little depth . Their original intention was to trap and contain the Parallax Star after it ran out of steam . However, they miscalculated the charging power of the Parallax Star!
While the expert mech inevitably lost some momentum, it was still substantial enough to make it difficult for O'Callahan to steer . It couldn't make any sharp turns to charge down the enemy mechs positioned at the sides . Like a meteor descending upon an innocent planet, nothing could alter its path that was destined to wipe of all forms of life on the globe!
However, O'Callahan didn't feel to disappointed about the lack of targets . The Venerable deliberately chose this angle to charge because there was one more enemy asset in the way .
"The Parallax Star is charging towards an enemy combat carrier!"
What guts! Before the Frosty Meteors could turn around and pelt the enemy expert mechs with their ranged weapons, the Parallax Star already left the sluggish Frosty Meteors in the dust! Instead, it continued to aim its lance point at the closest combat carrier in alignment!
In their initial decision to charge the stranded Vandal task force, the Frosty Meteors decided to keep their ships close . Besides the water-carrying transports that had already departed via FTL, the combat carriers were still needed for command and control as well as to retrieve their mechs if they needed to escape into FTL for whatever reason .
The Meteors gathered a substantial amount of intelligence on the Flagrant Vandals, so they knew that they faced a slippery opponent . If the mechs of the Meteors separated from the combat carriers, then Major Verle would certainly order his light mechs to circle around and sabotage the combat carriers .
The only way to prevent a sneak attack on their carriers was to leave behind some guards or to bring them alone . The Meteors couldn't afford to take too many mechs out of their battle lines so they opted to keep their combat carriers close with their main force of mechs .
This kept the combat carriers safe from harassment, but also exposed them to the ravages of battle . This time, the Frosty Meteors had made a grave miscalculation as the Parallax Star only shifted a few degrees to bring it on a direct collision course against the enemy combat carrier .
"I-Impossible! How can a lancer mech be reckless enough to charge a heavily armored combat carrier!"
The proper way to fight combat carriers was to bombard them from range or to sneak inside their hangar bays and wreak havoc from within .
Venerable O'Callahan directly ignored those roles and brought his Parallax Star into an inexorable collision against the hapless enemy ship! Everyone who thought fast enough to keep up with the action cried madness in their hearts! A lancer mech charging straight against the armored bow of a combat carrier was sheer madness!
Yet the expert pilot would hear nothing of it . His maddened fury drove him to utter hatred against these arrogant Venidse mechs! They probably called him a fossil or the like! Before his charge arrived, none of the mechs of the Frosty Meteors showed any caution to him . No way could O'Callahan tolerate such callous disregard!
"Combat carrier? It's all the same to me!" O'Callahan laughed . "Yield to me!"
Chapter 546
When the Parallax Star's lance hit the forward prow of the combat carrier, common sense went out the window .
In any other situation, the mech should have yielded . Yet this was an expert mech driven forward by an expert pilot . Advanced in age he might be, but every expert pilot possessed the power to defy logic .
Even as the thick layers of the combat carrier's hull plating began to buckle, the Parallax Star's energy field rapidly began to dim as it struggled to protect the expert mech it enveloped against crushing itself apart . Yet no matter how dim it grew, it never winked out .
Like an everlasting sun, the Parallax Star shredded through the prow of the ship and punched into the much less durable interior of the ship! Compartment after compartment parted into as the mech and its indomitable charge brought it deeper into the heart of the vessel!
However, everything came to an end . The ship's interior might not have been as durable as the outer hull, it still formed a substantial obstacle to the Parallax Star because there was so much of it the mech had to bore through . Its momentum rapidly bled off until it barely reached the inner half of the combat carrier .
Secondary explosions quickly started to rattle the combat carrier as the sudden cavity set off a chain reaction of catastrophic effects!
Over a hundred crew members lost their lives instantly as the mech bore through their compartments, and a hundred more became at risk as their bodies floated away into vacuum! If they didn't wear their hazard suits as a precaution, they would have suffocated in an instant!
The combat carrier was as good as crippled . The Parallax Star punched its lance into the compartments beyond . From his extensive experience, O'Callahan knew that he had reached deep enough inside the combat carrier to approach its highly fortified bridge, command center or combat information center . No matter which lay beyond, all of them served a key purpose for the Frosty Meteors .
Though the Venerable's instincts screamed at him to depart from this ship, he persevered and forced his mech through one more compartment! He ignored the flailing figures his lance had breached and mercilessly raked the tip back and forth until he blended every human into unrecognizable meat .
No human could withstand the force of a mech weapon!
"Serves you right for belittling me!"
Though O'Callahan's fury abated a little after finishing his first charge in years, he still needed to teach the rest a lesson they would never forget!
The Parallax Star quickly climbed out of the hole it had made and left the crippled combat carrier behind . With a flaring of its powerful flight system, the expert mech propelled itself to the sides, away from any enemy ships or mechs .
The expert mech wasn't fleeing . It was arcing around for another charging pass!
The impact of the charge and its devastating result against a Kenas Oliphant, Caca Similas and a combat carrier knocked the Frosty Meteors out of their sense of complacency . This was no aged fossil they faced! The threat of death and the excitement of facing a formidable challenge invigorated the Meteors into taking this battle seriously .
A highly regarded mech regiment such as the Frosty Meteors never lost heart after suffering a setback! If the Vandals suffered something similar, then they would have immediately fallen apart as a cohesive unit .
The smarter Meteors also knew that their opponent wouldn't be able to replicate that devastating charge . All kinds of factors fell into place to make that initial charge so destructive .
First, the Meteors didn't think much of Venerable O'Callahan . The thirty laveres that measured from his resonance during the approach hadn't reached a level that would be a cause for concern .
However, in the final seconds before the Parallax Star crashed through the Kenas Oliphant, the Parallax Star's resonance readings spiked in the forties all of a sudden! Such a significant boost in resonance strength had qualitatively transformed the strength of the expert mech's charge!
The second factor that played a role was that both sides had been approaching each other . A shuttle crashing against an immobile wall unleashed a lot less energy than two shuttles flying straight against each other . The impact of two converging forces resulted in much more damage than anticipated when combined with the spike in resonance .
Now that he Parallax Star matched velocities with the Frosty Meteor formation, it would take at least thirty minutes of circling in order to build up an equivalent amount of momentum . The Frosty Meteors would never give the Parallax Star that much time! Even if the Venidse didn't bother chasing after the much-faster Parallax Star, they could still vent their aggression on the immobilized ships of the Vandals!
Though Venerable O'Callahan didn't particularly care about the Flagrant Vandals, they were his only ticket out of here . For better or worse, he needed to attack immediately . It wasn't enough to apply some pressure . The Flagrant Vandals would only prevail if the Frost Meteors was beaten back!
Back inside the Shield of Hispania's command center, Ves still had to catch up with what had happened . Others didn't think so much and cheered as if their favorite mech athlete downed an enemy mech within the opening minute of the duel . Though the Vandals quickly got back to work, the joy and faith engendered by Venerable O'Callahan fantastic performance still lifted their moods .
Ves rewinded the moment where the Parallax Star bore straight through a heavy mech, a medium mech and the front half of a combat carrier of all things . He didn't pay attention to the flashy energy field or the unwaveringly straight lance . Instead, he drew his eyes to the telemetry .
Much of the Parallax Star's parameters spiked to unheard of levels .
"Is this the power of resonance?"
He noted with great interest that the Venerable's resonance spiked in proportion with the rise in parameters . There was a definite relation between the two . "Still, forty-four laveres at its height? Isn't that O'Callahan's record when he was at his best?"
Iris leaned over to take a peek at the parameters . "That's pretty impressive, but it's costly as well . I don't think the Venerable can withstand the consumption that is required to pull off such a performance . That single charge must have burned through at least a month of his lifespan . There's always a price for power . Especially at his age, the more he pushes beyond his limits, the more he exhausts what remains of his potential . "
It was a fair statement to make . Ves didn't completely understand all of the mechanics behind resonance and how expert pilots evoked resonance, but he certainly believed it couldn't be replicated so easily .
"You're right . Everything has a price . I hope that Venerable O'Callahan can pay enough to redeem our lives . "
No matter how little he thought of the expert pilot, the man fought to preserve their lives . Even if his intentions were selfish, Ves still couldn't help but root for the Venerable .
"Come on! You can do this!"
The Parallax Star might not have the time to build up its former earthshaking charge, but it could still accumulate sufficient momentum to threaten the Frosty Meteors . After several rounds of circling, the expert mech dove in yet again . Against the heavy mechs arrayed against the Vandals, the Parallax Star hardly required any effort to land the perfect hit! The heavy mechs couldn't dodge to save their lives!
Just as O'Callahan was about to initiate his charge, the haze of fury that engulfed his mind had begun to fade a little bit . He regained enough of his senses to listen to his military advisor screaming over the comm channel .
"Don't focus on the heavy space knights! It takes too much time to dismantle them! Aim your charges at their medium mechs! You can run them down a lot more often than the heavy mechs!"
Right now, the Flagrant Vandals wanted O'Callahan to prioritize on diminishing the numbers of the Frosty Meteors . Though the heavy mechs posed the highest threat to the Vandal fleet, the only way to accomplish a victory was to exact a heavy toll on the Frosty Meteors and entice them to abandon their attack run .
Though O'Callahan dearly wished to pound the heavy space knights into a pulp, his better sense took over and he obediently shifted his target towards the softer mechs .
"I can still run you down two at a time!"
The Frosty Meteors adjusted their formation in a way that put the medium and heavy knights in front of their more vulnerable mechs, but there was a limit to their maneuvering . Their deficient mobility worked against them as O'Callahan easily maneuvered his faster and nimbler mech around their formation and plunged into a neatly chosen angle that enabled the Parallax Star to graze its lance against two rifleman mechs at a time!
"Two more down! A hundred more to go!"
The Parallax Star turned from an unstoppable bull into a stubborn wasp that circled around the lumbering Frosty Meteors . No matter how many guns fired at the Parallax Star, its energy field never reached its limit, though it had grown dangerously dim at various times .
O'Callahan didn't attempt to charge the center of the enemy formation . Instead, he directed his mech to nibble at the edges, taking one or two mechs out at a time . He never chew off more than he could bite, so after each charge the Parallax Star hadn't lost too much momentum .
Every time the Parallax Star charged, it always managed to preserve a large proportion of its forward momentum . It circled gracefully after each charge and dove back in with renewed enthusiasm .
Mechs continued to drop out of formation after each charge . The wary combat carriers that trailed behind tried to pick up every wreck as best as possible, but the crippling of one of their combat carriers had put a serious dent in their cohesion . They didn't have the time to retrieve every wreck, and due to the Parallax Star's exceptional lethality, hardly any Vesian mech pilot survived the aftermath of the enemy charge!
"Vandals! Assist the Venerable! Encircle the Meteors! Take what is ours!"
"Take what is ours!"
The Vandal spaceborn mechs finally caught up with their expert pilot . Around half of their Inheritor light skirmishers dove around the Frosty Meteors, not daring to come any closer . The Hellcats hung back with the rest of the Vandal medium mechs, holding back for now as they knew their shock attacks wouldn't be able to put a dent in the Frosty Meteors despite their deteriorating state .
"Don't get pulled into a pitched battle! Harass them from the flanks and distract them from focusing their firepower on our expert!"
The Vandal mechs showed what they were best at and employed a number of harassment tactics . For example, the Inheritors constantly moved to threaten the heavy cannoneers and medium rifleman mechs . Both ranged mechs might pose a threat to them at range, but once the Inheritor came into melee range, they could easily tear them apart .
This forced the Frosty Meteors to position most of their knights to cover their ranged mechs .
The Frosty Meteors were known for their awesome shock attacks and their ability to endure . Their defensive formation left few holes for the regular Vandal mechs to exploit .
Nonetheless, they succeeded in distracting the Meteors, opening up more opportunities Venerable O'Callahan to charge down several mechs at once . The battle increasingly swung in their favor as the combination achieved a lot of results!
Yet no matter how fast the Venerable broke down the Meteor mechs, it simply wasn't fast enough! With five minutes to go until the Frosty Meteors crashed into the propulsion-less Vandal ships, something needed to change in order to swing the battle even further in their favor!
"Can we threaten their combat carriers?" Ves asked all of a sudden . "If we can threaten their mech berths, they might decide to draw back more strength . "
"It's too late for that . " Major Verle mused . "It's highly unlikely they will decide to yield . Don't forget that we are in Vesian space . Even if we destroy their rides out of this star system, they can still float in space for a week and wait for reinforcement ships to pick them up . "
The Frosty Meteors already suffered a substantial amount of losses . Only victory could redeem their shame!
Chapter 547
The Vesians lost over forty mechs, which was more than enough to cause any commander to disengage their attack run . Not so for the commanding officer of the Frosty Meteors . Their mech doctrine emphasized an attitude of committing to an attack . No matter how many mechs they lost, they wouldn't break and scatter .
Why?
Because they were the Frosty Meteors . Billions of Vesian citizens looked up to them . They upheld their creed of getting hit but hitting back harder . In no way should any mech pilot of the Meteors falter before they reached their targets . Their myths said nothing about abortive attacks .
Still, the Flagrant Vandals made it harder for them to reach the stranded enemy vessels intact . Venerable O'Callahan picked off several mechs of the Frosty Meteors with disturbing regularity .
In front of the Parallax Star, no amount of armor could save a mech from doom . The famed heavy armor of the Frosty Meteors turned from asset into a liability .
The Caca Similas, their rifleman mechs, their Rwindo Secundus, their medium space knight, and their Charix Magansus, their medium lancer mech, all benefited from some of the finest mass-produced compressed armor from Venidse .
The benefits all of this armor brought to the Frosty Meteors enabled them to excel in frontal clashes .
However, getting pelted from all sides by the Flagrant Vandals was a whole different beast . Besides the unstoppable attack runs from the Parallax Star, the rest of the Vandals proved their mettle as well . The copies of the Caca Similas barely endured the focus fire from the harassasing Vandal mechs . Due to the low firing rate of their heavy ballistic rifles, the Caca Similas mechs barely managed to land a hit on the agile Vandal mechs .
However, any Vandal mech that did managed to get hit often went down for the count . Even a single hit was sufficient to disrupt them, leaving them open to follow-up attacks that instantly wrecked the disoriented mechs .
Vesians and Brighters screamed in fury as they let the battle consume their fears . None of them held back from doing their best in the battle . Every now and then a mech of the Frosty Meteors or the Flagrant Vandals spun out of formation with debris expanding from the wreckage like a cloud .
Sometimes, cockpits ejected in time, and these would navigate back to the safety of the combat carriers . Other times, the cockpits hadn't escaped in time, and their occupants suffered the fate of those who died in space, with their piloting suits breached and their bodies broken, frozen and decompressed .
The entire battle showcased the determination of both sides . Two different mech doctrines clashed against each other in a brutal confrontation . While it appeared the Flagrant Vandals held a decisive advantage with the help of their expert pilot, in fact they were running out of time!
They couldn't pick off the mechs of the Meteors fast enough!
Back at the command center, everyone who hadn't changed into their hazard suits had already done so . With the Frosty Meteors reaching the ships of the Vandals in just a couple more minutes, the odds of sustaining heavy damage was high .
Nobody could be sure how many ships would be left after this battle .
Ves worked frantically to discover any weak points in the Meteor mechs, yet nothing stood out that was worth focusing on except for their flight systems, and even those had been clad with armor .
"We're all out of cards . " He sighed . "Even though we're downing the Meteor mechs by the dozens, we don't have much time left . "
Iris placed her armored gauntlet over his own . Their suit armor clanked as they collided against each other . "You're wrong . We haven't put in everything in the battle . There is still one more decision that the Vandals can make . "
She looked onwards to Major Verle, who seemed to struggle with an invisible dilemma behind his helmet's faceplate .
Eventually, the commanding officer gave the fateful orders . "Go all in . No holding back . "
Those words set off a chain reaction as the captains of the different mech companies in the field received orders to switch up their tactics . Instead of using their superior mobility to peck at the edges of the Frosty Meteor formation, they had been ordered to commit to a charge!
The Inheritors took the lead . As the lightest, fastest and most expendable mechs of the Vandals, their pilots had become accustomed to their role as cannon fodder . They all spiralled towards the hedgehog-like formation of the Frosty Meteors .
In this, their excellent acceleration and agility preserved most of their mechs . The heavy ballistic rifles of the Caca Similas mechs fared poorly against such agile targets . It was as if they attempted to shoot a cannon against an annoying fly that flitted around them with zippy wings .
Once or twice, the rifleman mechs took out an Inheritor, but the Vandal mechs came as a swarm . It didn't take long for the Vandal mechs to reach their formation, and that was when hell broke loose .
"Inheritors, decoys!"
The Inheritors couldn't penetrate the Meteor's formation . All the melee mechs formed into a ball with their weapons and shields directed outwards . The ranged mechs hid safely inside as they shot their weapons through the gaps of the formations .
The light skirmishers instead turned into a nuisance . They harassed the melee mechs and baited them into making a fruitless attack . Very few Inheritors sustained any damage because they always managed to dodge long before the sluggish mechs finished swinging their weapons .
A short time later, the real attack arrived .
"Hellcats, impact!"
The Inheritor mechs at the rear of the charging Meteor formation dispersed just in time for a substantial volleys of missiles to crash against the hefty mechs . Their defensive formation held up against the explosions, but solid spikes of giant nails followed soon after . The kinetic energy behind the nails further unbalanced their defensive posture .
The Hellcats themselves arrived soon after . The hybrid mechs had been designed for shock attacks, and right now they attempted to pull one off against mechs that could arguably do much better!
The results turned out to be rather mixed . The Vandals had taken the initiative, and they somewhat succeeded in unbalancing some of the Meteor mechs .
Unfortunately, the Meteor mechs had been built to withstand much worse . Virtually none of their mechs suffered any damage from the collision . Instead, the Hellcats arguably suffered substantially worse . The hybrid knight design fell short compared to the Kenas Oliphant and the Rwindo Secundus .
Both models of pure knight mechs viciously counterattacked against the Hellcats . Several precious Hellcat mechs went down from the combined attacks of the enemy knights and other mechs .
"Vandals! Fight until there is nobody left!"
Salvation arrived when the rest of the Vandal mechs came close . The ranged mechs kept a fair distance from the melee and pressured the Meteors from the flanks, well away from any angle that increased the odds of friendly fire .
The ranged mechs only served to pin some of the Meteors down, particularly their ranged mechs . The true threat to the Meteors consisted of the Hellcat and the other melee mechs of the Vandals!
With numbers on their side, the Vandal mechs attempted to gang up on the Meteor mechs and attempted to drown them in mechs! Any knight mech could ignore a single enemy mech in its face, but two would be stretching its defensive capabilities .
Three mechs at a time posed a substantial threat to its continued operation . Right now, this happened on a large scale as the Vandal melee mechs attempted to pry open their hardy shells with countless hands!
The mobbing tactic lacked the grace and forethought of the other tactics and formations that the Vandals demonstrated so far . Ves winced as he saw the casualty numbers pile up . Fighting the Frosty Meteors in formation was almost as futile as barbarians storming a Roman shield wall .
It was a good thing that the Vandals made a lot of progress . Many Meteor mechs fell out of formation as the flood of Vandal mechs overwhelmed their capacity to defend!
Employing huge crowds of mechs against a disciplined enemy was usually folly, but Major Verle proceeded anyway because they didn't have any choice! The Vandals could only trust in their numbers!
The dense collection of mechs made it difficult for anyone to judge how the battle progressed . However, Ves started to notice an encouraging pattern . The Vandal mob succeeded in destabilizing the defensive formation of their opponents . With so many enemy mechs crowding against them, they started to suffer unnecessary losses .
Each mech that fell diminished their numbers . They went from a hundred mechs to eighty mechs in quick succession, and their numbers declined even more now that the Vandals exploited the openings .
The only problem was that the Meteors retained much of their heavy mechs! If necessary, the Meteors wouldn't hesitate to abandon their medium mechs as long as their heavy mechs pushed through!
"We're making progress!"
The Parallax Star dove in for another attack run . Any Vandal mech in the way quickly disengaged from the brawl and and an opening for the Venerable to feast!
The energy field around the Parallax Star might have become a bit more frayed, but the Venerable still held on as if he bore the weight of the galaxy!
Surprisingly, he refocused his attack towards the heavy mechs! His spent a little more time circling around for this attack run, and it showed as his glowing mech plowed through a Kenas Oliphant, a Caca Similas and heavy cannoneer!
"Two enemy heavy mechs are incapacitated!"
Still, seven more heavy mechs remained! This time, the Parallax Star couldn't afford to dilly-dally with building up its momentum any longer . By the time it had readied its next attack run, the Frosty Meteors would have annihilated the vulnerable Vandal combat carriers .
The only choice was to join the mob!
"The Parallax Star has discarded its lance for its shortspear!"
Ves winced again . That lance was made out of an expensive mix of medium-grade exotics laced with trace amounts of high-grade exotics . Venerable O'Callahan just threw away a lance worth more than a billion credits!
He couldn't help but pass on a low-priority order to the queue . "Someone retrieve the Parallax Star's lance! Don't let it drift away in space!"
To his vast relief, a heavily damaged Inheritor mech that lost its entire right shoulder and arm had disengaged from the melee and chased after the lance .
O'Callahan deliberately halted his most effective attack in favor of helping the Vandals tear apart the remaining heavy mechs . The Kenas Oliphants remained the most acute threat to the Vandals . Once those heavy space knights fell out of the picture, the rest of the Frosty Meteors should be easy pickings .
With a guttural war cry the old man dove into the fray . Vandal mechs willingly made way for the expert mech as it charged towards the nearest heavy space knight . The Oliphant mech held up its tattered tower shield in an attempt to block the Parallax Star's diminished charge .
"Just because I like to charge doesn't mean I only know how to attack from one direction!"
The Parallax Star may have been designed for its powerful charges, but it possessed enough agility to slide around the Oliphant, dodge its slow but powerful sword slash, and stab the heavy mech in its rear .
Though the spear stab didn't have much power behind it, a casual blow from an expert mech couldn't be underestimated! With a light whiff of resonance, the spear successfully punched through the Oliphant's rear armor and damaged something vital!
The Oliphant wasn't down for the count yet due to its high redundancy factor, but other Vandals already started to kick the weakened mech now that it was down .
Venerable O'Callahan already shifted his attention to another Oliphant . Time was running out and all of the heavy mechs needed to be taken down!
"Heavy mechs or not, none of you can stand against my spear!"
Chapter 548
The Frosty Meteors broke . There was no way around it . With the Parallax Star fighting alongside the rank-and-file Vandal mech pilots, the entire mob fought harder than they had ever done so before .
The Flagrant Vandals knew they had to stop the Frosty Meteors from completing their doom charge against the Vandal ships . Several hours had gone by since Venidse's commando shuttles crippled their propulsion . It would take days for these ships to regain their mobility, time which they couldn't buy unless they could transition into FTL .
Fleeing into FTL meant abandoning their vitally important logistics ships . Every chief engineer in the task force gathered at the Beggar's Bounty and the Linever Swan to get their replacement FTL drives operational as fast as possible . The battle raging out in space seemed to have fired up their motivation to get them fixed, even managing to find a way to cut even more corners that shortened the repairs by two hours!
Still, the FTL drives couldn't be brought online immediately, so the Frosty Meteors had to be stopped at all costs .
The final tally was fairly gruesome . Ves glanced at the panel showing a summary of the mechs the Vandals deployed . "
"Two-hundred casualties . More than a hundred mechs are wrecked while the rest have suffered heavy damage . Over seventy pilots have been killed . "
The death toll for this battle was particularly brutal . Even with Venerable O'Callahan doing all of the heavy lifting, the mobbing tactic at the end resulted in a huge amount of casualties in just ten minutes of time .
The Flagrant Vandals succeeded, though, and that ultimately mattered more . After Venerable O'Callahan slaughtered the heavy mechs, the remaining Meteors had been torn down in quick succession . When their numbers diminished to only fifty mechs, it became clear that the Meteors wouldn't be able to inflict any fatal damage to the Vandals .
The Frosty Meteors called for a truce .
"Enough have suffered for today . " A tired voice began from the other side of the line .
Though the Vandals ate through the four mech companies of the Frosty Meteors until they were only a shadow of their former selves, the remnants could still take a ship or two down in their death throes while the aggravated Vandals extinguished them . Nobody wanted this tragic battle to escalate up to that point .
Major Verle quickly assented to the cease-fire .
"We'll stop killing you if you stop killing us . However, make no mistake, your survivors are only alive due to our benevolence . From the way I see it, we've won this battle . Salvage priority should go to us . "
According to the terms, the Frosty Meteors would halt any offensive actions for the rest of the day . They had thirty minutes of time to retrieve their dead and wounded mech pilots from their wrecks or escape pods . They had also been allowed to retrieve as many wrecks as they could, but only their medium mechs .
In the meantime, the Vandals did the same . They suffered a lot more casualties so buying this reprieve was much more important to them . A myriad of shuttles emerged from the combat carriers and headed towards the expanding debris field that was on a ballistic trajectory towards the local star .
Rescuing the wounded took priority over the dead and healthy . The faster they retrieved the wounded Vandals, the more they would be able to save at the end . Other mechs joined in the rescue effort as well, though they kept their guard around the remnants of the Frosty Meteors .
An awkward situation ensued as both sides tried their best not to pick up the fight again . The Vandals also kept their guard around their vulnerable ships for any stealth attacks . Just because Venidse's commando shuttles hadn't shown up again didn't mean they already left .
Complacency at this stage might doom them all, so the Vandals didn't dare to let down their guard .
Truly, this battle was an enormous shame for the Frosty Meteors . Only rarely had they ever admitted defeat, and they certainly never expected a lighter regiment such as the Flagrant Vandals to get the upper hand .
In the end, they had been too arrogant . They never accounted for the presence of Venerable O'Callahan . If not for the drastic intervention of the expert mech pilot, then they should have been able to defeat the Vandals by a very wide margin .
Venerable O'Callahan regained his cool after the battle . Once the heat and adrenaline of the battle against the Meteors faded into the background, his body became wracked with aches . His old body caught up to tiredness with a vengeance, and he slowly realized that the battle took a greater toll on his lifespan than he thought .
"I lost an entire year! Maybe more!"
Whatever the case, the hysterical O'Callahan immediately returned to the Gorgon's Gaze and hopped into his hibernation chamber as fast as possible . Every second counted in his view .
As the nominal winner of the battle, the Flagrant Vandals abused their privileges as much as they could . Ves hadn't been very useful during the actual battle, but at this moment he and every other mech designer became relevant as they picked and choosed which wrecks to retrieve .
"Should we salvage their heavy mechs?" Pierce asked over the comm . "They're extremely powerful if we can get them up, and we can also earn a lot of money if we simply sell the wrecks as is . "
There wasn't an easy answer to this question . Pierce was correct that the mechs could be powerful in their hands, but they didn't fit in with the Vandal mech doctrine . They also lacked the design specifications of the Kenas Oliphant so it would be impossible to repair the heavily damaged mechs up to their previous standards .
In addition, the Vandals probably didn't have any mech pilot with the right training to pilot a heavy mech .
Still, salvaging the wrecks for their material worth alone was very worthwhile . The mechs was made out of highly valuable alloys that still held their value in pieces . Retrieving them now and selling them down the road would allow the Vandals to trade for lots of essential supplies .
"Let's retrieve them, but only for resale . You don't have to be gentle with them and it's fine if you only retrieve portions of the heavy mechs . In any case, we don't want to leave the wrecks to the Frosty Meteors who will be able to piece them back together in no time . "
The Vandals on the field followed his instructions . The greedy Vandals had an eye for value, and they instinctively knew that the wrecks of the heavy mechs could be sold for a decent fortune . They didn't need much convincing to nab all of the valuable pieces, though finding some place to store the more intact wrecks turned out to be a challenge as well .
Slowly, half an hour went by as the Meteors finished rushing to retrieve all of their men . As previously agreed, the Meteor mechs returned to their combat carriers, which promptly transitioned into FTL immediately after . Since FTL travel couldn't be interrupted through regular means, this insured that they would no longer be able to play a role in this star system .
Of course, the truce only applied to the Frosty Meteors . If any other mech force from Venidse happened to drop by, they would start all over again .
Nobody wanted to see that . During the negotiations of the truce, the Frosty Meteors had been tight-lipped on the subject of reinforcements . They might arrive in a couple of hours, or they might only arrive a day later . It was imperative for the Flagrant Vandals to leave this star system as soon as possible .
"We're completely exposed here . Venidse not only knows we are in this star system, they also know our exact coordinates . Maybe the next batch of Venidse mechs will transitioned out of FTL right next to us instead of half an hour's flight away!"
The Flagrant Vandals continued to rush through their repair and cleanup efforts . They policed the battlefield as best they could and salvaged the most valuable wrecks in record time .
Two-and-a-half hours after the end of the battle, the Beggar's Bounty and Linever Swan finally regained their FTL functionality . Sort of . Maybe . Tentatively .
The chief engineers hadn't been too certain about their work . If they had an extra hour or two, they could provide more assurances, but Major Verle wasn't willing to stick around any longer and let another wave of Vesian reinforcements catch them at their weakest .
"We leave immediately!"
They let the two logistics ships transition into FTL first, if only to make certain that they could make the jump . With a hazy flicker, the two ships transitioned into FTL with obvious difficulty . Still, the chief engineers declared their work a success .
"The FTL drives require a lot of servicing after the ships come out of FTL, but we are confident that the FTL drives are working as intended, sir . "
"What are the odds of failure?" Major Verle asked .
"That is difficult to pin down . Our rough guess would be five percent . "
Any chief engineer would be horrified to hear such words . Twenty percent of failure meant that one out of twenty FTL transitions led to horrific disasters . If such odds became the norm throughout the entire galaxy, all FTL travel might collapse after a couple of years .
Right now, their dire situation didn't give them the luxury to lower this error rate . If the task force still remained in this star system by the time the next wave of reinforcements arrived, their odds of failure would reach a hundred percent!
"Let us leave this bloodied star . Begin transition!"
The rest of the task force followed suit and disappeared into FTL .
The battle had finally come to an end .
Some people cheered . Others cried . More simply turned numb . This was because the battle truly hadn't been good for the Vandals . Sure, they fought and beat the mechs from one of the most formidable Vesian mech regiments . This certainly brought a lot of glory to the Vandals once they sent word of it back home . But did that bring the dead back to life?
"At least seventy dead so far . More may follow suit in the coming days as some of the wounded might not make it through . "
Any mech pilot that suffered injuries would certainly be in a very bad state . This was their fate should a cockpit be breached . A human body could not withstand the the level of damage inflicted by a mech .
Most of the Vandals couldn't sit still yet in order to mourn the fallen . They still needed to process the aftermath of the battle . Of acute importance was to repair the sublight propulsion systems of every combat carrier that suffered from the previous stealth attack . This would take days as the damage required both interior and exterior repairs .
Fixing up the engineering bay and the interior systems didn't require any special circumstances . Engineers had already begun the repairs .
The exterior repairs on the other hand could only be done when the ships transitioned out of FTL . It wasn't safe for humans to crawl over the hull of a starship in FTL . Very weird things tend to happen to humans that find themselves exposed to the higher dimensions in a direct fashion .
Most tend to... disappear . Where they went, nobody knew .
This meant that once they arrived at their next star system, the task force required at least several days to finish the repairs to the thrusters and other exterior elements .
Combined with the need to service the newly-installed FTL drives on the logistics ships, this basically meant they would be stranded yet again .
Everyone hoped that Venidse wouldn't be able to catch up to them before they finished repairs at the other end .
"Our engineers have their work cut out for them . Mech designers like us have our own duties to fulfill . " Ves said as he read through his increasingly large to-do list . "We're short on at least a hundred spaceborn mechs, and hundreds more require essential repairs . Let's get to work . "
Chapter 549
As far as Ves was concerned, no one won the battle against the Frosty Meteors .
The Meteors lost ten heavy mechs and around a hundred other mechs . Such losses only amounted to five percent of the Venidse mech regiment's total strength, so they haven't suffered very much at all . Certainly, replacing the expensive mechs and highly-trained mech pilots lost in the battle was going to be a pain, but their abundant funding easily allowed them to recoup their losses .
The Flagrant Vandals on the other hand might have won the battle, but they also lost the war . They outright lost over a hundred spaceborn mechs and many more required urgent servicing before they could be put back onto the field .
The task force's ability to defend itself against spaceborn threats had reached its lowest point since their departure from the Detemen System . According to the latest data accessible to Ves, the Vandals could barely launch more than two-hundred space-capable mechs, most of which disproportionately slanted towards ranged mechs .
During the final phase of the previous battle where Major Verle basically threw his hands in the air and gave permission for the Vandals to discard all tactics, a lot of melee mechs got thrashed . It was the logical outcome when lighter melee mechs clashed against a tight, disciplined formation of heavier mechs .
"Fighting the Frosty Meteors on their terms is a road to defeat . "
The Vandals only resorted to such a wasteful attack because they had no other choice . They needed to take out the incoming Frosty Meteors before they reached their vulnerable starships, and the mobbing tactic was the only one in which they could tear down the Frosty Meteors quickly .
Right now, every Vandal had become numb . While the task force might have succeeded in saving their logistics ships and escaped into FTL, the hefty losses certainly felt like a massive loss . Every serviceman Ves walked by in the corridors appeared to be torn with grief or resigned to a grim outcome .
Their confidence in the Flagrant Vandals had evaporated . No one could take such a massive loss and remain upbeat . The usually air of casualness and nonchalance that Ves found so charming about the Vandals couldn't be maintained in the aftermath of the battle .
"Too many mech pilots have lost their lives . "
Another burial ceremony was on the agenda . Despite the urgent need to conduct repairs, some of the 3D printers stopped their current fabrication jobs in order to churn out coffins that would either hold bodies or mementos of the dead .
Ves did not like this diversion of vital production capacity, but he understood why it needed to be done . The Flagrant Vandals completely lost heart . In between the mourning of the dead, Ves heard an increasing amount of whispers of discontent from the rank-and-file .
"Why are we heading to the Reinald Republic? Can't our bosses send a message over the galactic net? This journey is pointless!"
"Jerry is gone . Akness is gone . Moezi has lost both his legs . How many mech pilots need to die? It's too much!"
"I don't know what we are fighting for . Aren't we supposed to defend the Republic? Why are we moving further and further away from our homes?"
"You know, the Bright Republic hasn't done anything to help us out . I say it's time we cut ourselves off from the Mech Corps . We've done our duty and more . Let the rest sort out the mess . "
Calls for abandoning the mission and changing course grew ever-louder . Ves merely shook his head when he heard talk like this . It wasn't as if they could turn around and leave the Kingdom from any other angle .
Back in his office, Ves had his hands full trying to organize a coordinated repair effort . It was safe to say that his original timetable completely became untenable . Though it still served its use as a guide on what to focus on in future missions, they couldn't adhere to the schedule anymore . Their backlog of repairs threatened to overwhelm their logistical capacity .
Rather than sit back and give up, Ves decided to work with what he had . In his next conference call with the mech designers, he laid out their priorities . "The mission isn't over . We aren't out of the woods yet . I've prepared new assignments for you to fulfill . Right now, Major Verle has confided into me that we will be attempting to stay out of trouble when we are crossing through the Klein Duchy . Nonetheless, that doesn't preclude another ambush, so our highest priority is to get as much spaceborn mechs back online as possible . "
Mercator's projection raised his hand . "What about our landbound mechs?"
"Frankly, they're irrelevant for the duration of this trip . " Ves answered . "While I can't state whether we have any landbound operations on the horizon, they're in pretty good shape since the Detemen Operation . I don't see the need in allocating precious manpower and resources into polishing them into a shine . Our spaceborn combat capability is the foundation of our survival, so I want all hands on deck into lifting it to a smidgeon of its former self . "
"How many mechs do you expect us to repair?"
"We've retrieved enough damaged and mostly-intact wrecks to restore about a hundred mechs, more or less . Any more and we'll need to dip into our stock of heavily damaged wrecks, which are a real pain to restore with the limited equipment at our disposal . It's safe to say that we'll be having our hands full with the easiest repairs for now . I expect this to be done within a single month . "
"A month?! Sir, that's asking too much of us!"
"I'm not . I know we can do it . Some of you will need to work harder than before, but I'm certain you are up to the task . Make no mistake . Our survival is at stake . The more mechs you can fix, the more mechs the Vandals will have at their disposal when the next batch of Vesians come knocking at our door . "
The mech designers swamped Ves with questions, some of which he replied with the same generic answers .
One question resonated a lot among the mech designers . It was the same issue that plagued the regular Vandals as well . Mercator stood up and asked the question that Ves expected to be asked .
"Why are we fighting? What is our true mission? Don't tell us that we have to reach the Reinald Republic! This ordeal is too unusual for it to be so simple!"
Ves wagged his finger, causing Iris to press something on her control panel . Mercator's projection instantly became muted .
"I would like to remind you who you are speaking to, Deputy Mercator . " After giving the offending mech designer the stink eye, Ves turned his gaze upon the other projections . "I just met with Major Verle in private this morning . I asked the same question that you have . Did you know how he answered?"
The silence in the conference room became palpable .
"It is not our place to ask these kind of questions! I know this isn't what you want to hear, but you can bet that most of the Vandals in the fleet are similarly left in the dark . Letting our curiosity get the better of us is not in our job description . Just as how the mech pilots are expected to pilot their mechs, we are expected to service those machines . Nothing more is required from us, and continued inquiries will only land you in trouble with the Vandals . "
Ves had made his stance clear, even if he didn't entirely agree with it himself . He hadn't spoken the truth just now .
Although it was true that Ves stormed into Major Verle's office to demand an explanation, he also conducted his own investigation beforehand .
It wasn't easy trying to peer into a secret that the brass wanted to remain hidden . Ves first started off by revisiting his earlier speculations .
His first assumption was that the Verle Task Force was required to head over to the Reinald Republic was because they carried something very sensitive .
His second assumption was that the object of value that required an immediate extraction from Vesian space was something utterly unique and irreplaceable . This ruled out important data, which could have easily been conveyed over the galactic net .
The only thing that stood out to Ves was Lord Javier . He had to admit that the conspiracy theories the Vandals spouted to each other when they were bored made the most sense . Having witnessed Lord Javier's arrest on the ground at Detemen IV, Ves became aware that the noble heir was in possession of something vitally important to the Detemen League and the Flagrant Vandals .
Like the brat he was, Lord Javier refused to hand over the so-called 'things' . Whatever they were talking about, Ves suspected that these things might have been important enough to justify a long-distance raid on the Detemen System in the first place .
Therefore, sending the Verle Task Force off into a crazy journey off to the Reinald Republic from the heart of the Vesia Kingdom sounded a bit more plausible if their objectives concerned these things .
Through logic, Ves tried to deduce where Lord Javier might be held among their fleet . He quickly ruled out every ship except two .
The Gorgon's Gaze was the most strategically important ship because she was the mothership of Venerable O'Callahan and the Parallax Star . Though the Venerable stated that he would only be able to deploy for battle one last time, he still posed a huge deterrent to anyone aiming to rescue Lord Javier .
The other possibility was that Lord Javier imprisoned aboard the Shield of Hispania . From what Ves had understood of Major Verle, the mech officer appeared to be the type that prepared for the worst . He wouldn't want their VIP to be out of reach . Thus it made a lot of sense for Lord Javier to be stuck on their flagship .
Ves took some time off his busy schedule to wander around . Despite the massive pile of work that demanded his attention, he made up an excuse of performing a personal inspection in other to get an impression of the mood among the crew to explore the entire ship .
He went from bow to stern, port to starboard, upper decks to the lower decks, and on so on . His keen cognitive functions constructed a mental map of the layout of the Shield of Hispania . While Ves never obtained a full map of the combat carrier, he still spotted several deviances from the schematics that Ves had gotten his hands on through various channels .
Certain compartments turned out to be a little more compact than usual . In other areas, the decks weren't quite even, though the standard artificial gravity made it hard for anyone to notice the discrepancy .
All in all, through various tricks, the original ship designer of the Shield of Hispania managed to incorporate several hidden compartments within the massive ship . They might not be very large, but they very much existed according to the mental map that Ves drew up in his mind .
The only problem was that Ves couldn't stick around long enough to investigate these cavities, let alone force an entry in them . He decided to resort to the one method that the Vandals certainly hadn't anticipated .
Ves attempted to employ his Spirituality . What he used to call his sixth sense was in fact a new and practically unheard-of way for him to interact with the spiritual side of reality .
Though he mostly employed this sense to design mechs or detect danger, he sometimes flexed it in other ways . Though he hadn't figured out how to turn his body into a semi-corporeal state like Lucky, he did sometimes succeed in brushing against the minds of other humans .
Every human possessed a unique mind . Like fingerprints, they were never the same . One remarkable feature about sensing minds was that stronger or more eccentric individuals stood out from the crowd .
Having seen Lord Javier in person, he instinctively memorized the noble's unique flavor . Ves scoured throughout the entire trip, making himself as circumspect as possible in an attempt to probe his spirituality through the bulkheads into the hidden compartments .
Most didn't contain anything alive . Ves had the sense that they only held a lot of important machinery .
One hidden compartment was different . Unlike the others, Ves faintly sensed a mind that matched the flavor that Ves remembered .
He was right! Lord Javier was truly aboard the Shield of Hispania!
Chapter 550
After his discovery, Ves acted out a play . He pretended as if he was as frustrated as the other Vandals, not even hesitating to demand a meeting with Major Verle to obtain some answers .
The rigid mech officer refused to spill the beans, just as Ves expected . The man had a point that a secret as momentous as this should only be known by those who needed to know . Ves did not actually require an answer to perform his duties, so he was firmly on the very large list that definitely didn't need to learn the truth .
Ves couldn't blame them from withholding the fact that they imprisoned Lord Javier and was attempting to bring him out of the Kingdom . Though their greater motivations escaped him, the Vandals would surely be doing it for a reason .
That reason may be a great cause, or a selfish cause . Whatever the case, Ves had no further leads to pursue . Walking close to the hidden compartments already raised some flags, so Ves planned to keep his head down for the time being and pretend that he knew nothing more than the rest .
After the conference call, the mech designers all tackled their work with urgent effort . Ves was glad to see that nobody slacked off time, and many had in fact exceeded their former standards .
"When other people's lives are on the line, there's no sense of urgency . Now that there's a substantial chance that we might all go down, it's no wonder that they are working so hard . "
With a deficit of more than two-hundred mechs, the Flagrant Vandals would be hard-pressed to regain their former strength . Ves deliberately set their goal post to restoring a hundred mechs within a month as an aspiration . He didn't expect the mech technicians and mech designers to reach this target, but getting close enough already helped out a lot .
As the task force finally left the accursed territory of Venidse, the Vandals kept themselves while they crossed through the space claimed by the Klein Duchy .
During this time, they managed to drop their work to hold another solemn space burial .
Over a hundred coffins had been laid out in the hangar bay of the Shield of Hispania . The sheer amount of coffins weighed down upon the survivors like a boulder . Pretty much every Vandal knew someone who rested in those coffins .
Seeing the coffins placed on the decks with the banners of the Vandals draped on top of them emphasized the peril they still hadn't gotten away from yet . How many more Vandals would lose their lives in the coming days and weeks? A hundred? Two-hundred? Maybe all of them? Nobody knew, but all of them feared the answer .
The Vandals plainly weren't in a fighting condition at that time .
Fortunately, Klein appeared to be as equally fearful of the Vandals as the Vandals feared getting entangled with their mech legions . From the intelligence the local rebels passed on to the Vandals, Klein wanted nothing to do with the scrappy enemy force that thrashed the Frosty Meteors .
Pyrrhic it may be, word of the victory had already spread throughout the Kingdom and the Republic . The victory cemented the reputation of the Flagrant Vandals as devious but capable warriors .
While Venidse had a lot more mechs to spare, Klein faced the opposite situation . As a peripheral territory in the Kingdom, they could afford to be lavish with their mech legions . They hoarded their mechs as if they were their own children, and rarely deployed them against formidable enemies .
Though the Vandals had lost over half of their spaceborn combat capability, Klein didn't know that . As long as the Vandals kept their true condition silent, the Vesians wouldn't have any reason to hunt them down .
This was why the Vandals acted very circumspect around the VRF and the local rebels . Ves even received orders directly from Major Verle to limit the amount of information Iris could access .
Telling their guest designer to fob off was not a pleasant conversation for Ves .
"Our mechs are in a bad shape, Iris . I think it's best if you lend your skills to the mech technicians . They're awfully short-handed . "
Iris glowered at him . "Don't you need me anymore, boss?"
"Ah, eh, you're not the only one who needs to get their hands dirty . Some of the most complex repairs can't be performed by anyone in the fleet except me . That should give you an idea how urgently we require more technical expertise . "
With that quick excuse, Ves packed Iris off . Naturally, he wasn't wrong either . He did plan to allocate some of his time to restore the more difficult cases . He even took the time to select some promising wrecks and requested the Vandals to transfer them to the Shield of Hispania .
Thus far, the Vandals managed to keep Klein guessing and their rebel partners mostly in the dark . The only time where Ves thought the gig may have been up was when they converged in a desolate star system to trade away a substantial amount of loot and salvaged mechs for much-needed resources . If the rebels had someone smart on their payroll, then they would have recognized the significance of the materials that the Vandals had requested .
They couldn't do anything about it . During staff meetings and private talks with Lieutenant Commander Soapstone, Ves reiterated the importance of replenishing their stockpiles .
"You either get me the supplies on this list, or you'll have to accept the fact that we're going to be short of at least fifty mechs . "
Presented with that argument, Verle and Soapstone couldn't resume their penny-pinching ways and continue to hoard their useless riches . What they needed the most right now was to supplement their battle strength . The odds of making it out of the Hafner Duchy at their current strength was small .
It would already be hopefully optimistic that the Vandals would be able to field around three-hundred mechs . That was the number of spaceborn mech pilots the task force had left that could still go into battle . The rest had died or suffered grievous injuries that their onboard medical bays couldn't treat .
A small number of mech pilots even suffered neural damage that permanently disabled their ability to interface with a mech .
Ves knew there was no going back from such an injury . Even his grandfather suffered from the same affliction, and despite his prestige as a former expert pilot, he had no choice but to resign his commision .
All the suffering throughout the entire fleet affected Ves on a spiritual level . His heightened spiritual sense picked up the waves of grief, apathy, and other unpleasant emotions . The mech pilots in particular acted as beacons of despair, whose negative emotions propagated stronger and further than any other human .
Ves even suspected that they were responsible for exacerbating the negative mood that descended upon the task force .
"It's as if the mech pilots are infecting everyone's moods with theirs . "
That wasn't good news, because all of the casualties of the previous battles happened to be mech pilots .
Mech pilots interacted the most with their fellow kind . They developed very strong bonds of brotherhood with the people that fought by their sides, so their deaths impacted the surviving mech pilots most of all .
Ves sometimes wondered if this dark cloud of emotions would doom the Vandals to defeat . If Klein ever summed up the courage to track down the task force and force a battle, the outcome wouldn't be in question as long as the Vesians brought enough mechs .
"This can't go on, but I don't know what to do . "
It was hard to cheer up the Vandals . While they were professional enough not to let their emotions get in the way of their duties, it was easy to see that they couldn't match the steel of their recent opponents .
Premier mech regiments such as the Calico Dancer Bats or the Frosty Meteors wouldn't enter a spiral of doubt and self-blame . Their grit was legendary . Even if they lost over ninety percent of their fighting force, the remaining ten percent would still cling onto their tradition and rebuild what they lost .
"It's all about belief and willpower . "
These traits couldn't be measured on an objective scale . Yet their importance ranked at the top . Even if the Vandals fielded better mechs, they would still be considered trash if they couldn't bounce back from a modest defeat .
Though Ves mourned alongside the Vandals, he plainly didn't feel as much grief . "In the end, I'm not a Vandal after all . "
As the head designer, Ves needed to keep the bigger picture into account . He couldn't afford to get hung up on the past while the future still seemed turbulent .
The hierarchy also reinforced this detachment . Mech designers didn't directly integrate with the mech regiments . Instead, they stood apart and formed their own self-contained group . They answered only to the highest ranking mech officer on-site .
This separation came in handy as the other mech designers also appeared to be less affected by the doom and gloom that had overtaken the Vandals . Ves ordered them to push the mech technicians to get over their grief and work hard .
Though the mech designers only partially succeeded into kicking the mech technicians back into gear, any increase of productivity was welcome .
Thus, a long period of tranquility ensued . The task force continued their silent trek to the border of the Kingdom, meeting very little setbacks along the way .
The Vandals even managed to slip into the Hafner Duchy without encountering any hostile forces at all . Klein hadn't managed to sum up the courage to go after them in the end .
"Thank the heavens that the Duke of Klein is a scaredy-cat!"
"It's as if angels are watching over our shoulders!"
"Well, you better brace yourselves, because the Duke of Hafner is nothing like his neighboring peer . That man is responsible for guarding the border . The big ponce won't tolerate any incursions from Reinald . He'll be even more determined to stop us from making a getaway . "
Ves agreed with that sentiment . Although the Hafner territory was situated on the other side of the border to the Bright Republic, they nonetheless heard some stories about how seriously they guarded their space .
The main threat did not come from the Reinald Republic . In fact, the neighboring state was actually only a third the size of the Bright Republic .
Ordinarily, the aggressive Vesia Kingdom should have invaded Reinald as intensely as they attempted to invade the Bright Republic .
The only reason the Vesians curbed their aggression towards Reinald was that the latter forged a defensive alliance with two other minor republics . Both the Roppo Principality and the Council Stars of Lisv banded together with the Reinald Republic to present a united front against the Vesia Kingdom .
Everyone referred to their defensive pact as the Frozen Leaf Alliance . Though each individual alliance member was weak enough to be crushed by the Vesians, together they formed a formidable line of defence .
The Vesians had tested them over and over, but their bonds to each other turned out to be stronger than the relations of competing Vesian duchies .
This could still be overcome, if not for the possibility that other neighboring states might decide to join the Frozen Leaf Alliance . If Reinald, Roppo and Lisv fell to the Vesians, the states beyond that might be next .
This effectively curbed the desire of the Vesians to aggressively expand in this direction . As long as they didn't make any threatening moves, the Frozen Leaf Alliance wouldn't grow to the point of becoming a threat to the Kingdom .
"Still, even without a war, their citizens still need somewhere to vent . "
The mech pilots of the three alliance states didn't face the threat of war like their counterparts in the Bright Republic . Too much complacency bred weakness, so officially the Frozen Leaf Alliance encouraged the establishment of mercenary corps and treasure hunting outfits as a way for adventurous mech pilots to get their fighting urges out of their system .
Unofficially, they encouraged the establishment of less-than-legal outfits, and often turned a blind eye when these shady outfits decided to do their business across the border .
The Vesia Kingdom suffered a lot of damage from pirates that originated from the Alliance . Though the evidence was never there, both sides knew the score .
The Hafner Duchy took on the important task of curbing every pirate incursion that crossed border from the Reinald Republic . Over the centuries, they became very adept at hunting pirate outfits .
Unfortunately, the Flagrant Vandals happened to share a lot in common with pirates .
Chapter 551
A hatch slid open, allowing Ves entry into the dinghy compartment . Compared to the clean and relatively tidy interior of the rest of the Shield of Hispania, Ves had entered what should have formerly been a backup storage area .
A large closet, in other words .
Now, the compartment had been turned into a lounge of some sorts . A couple of sofas, some pots with alien plants and a simple table surrounded by chairs took up much of the room while muted projection of archival mech duels played in the background .
Chief Technician Carletta Haine, Chief Engineer Morgan Avanaeon and Lieutenant Command Lisea Soapstone already sat on three of the four chairs . They all greeted Ves as he took the final seat .
"Good to see you Larkinson . "
"Been working hard today, eh?"
"You still owe me three tons of platinum!"
"I'll make it up to you, Soapstone . " Ves said somewhat tiredly . "I hadn't anticipated using it as a substitute material for my repairs . "
Chief Haine who set up this compartment in the first place pressed her finger against the table, causing a projection of a sophisticated board game to appear on the table . The game featured miniature mech and ship models, only a couple of which the players started out . The space above the table turned into a three-dimensional star map where the game would be played out .
"Pirate Empires again?" Chief Morgan whined as he whipped out a bottle and glass from somewhere and poured himself a drink . "This game is over a century old . No offense, but you see the same strategies play out over and over again . "
"That's the beauty of this game . " Soapstone said with a smile . She gripped the projection of a random assortment of identically scaled mechs and ships and rolled them around like they were dice . "If we're all familiar with the same strategies, the game becomes a contest of mind games . Why do you think chess is still the same after several millennia after its inception?"
"I'm running this game with all the latest expansions . " The chief technician added . "The threat of a major alien invasion will spice things up if you want to deal with an extra challenge . What do you think, head designer?"
Ves yawned a bit . "I'm not very familiar with the last couple of expansions, but I'm aware of the rules . The game developers have added even more randomization in the game, I hear . That's going to be annoying to deal with . This game is pretty much ninety percent about luck and ten percent about skill . "
"You're wrong, Larkinson . " The chief engineer replied . "That ninety percent luck you're talking about really refers to your ability to manage fortune and risks . Good and bad things happen in every game . It's your ability to mitigate the bad outcomes and benefit from the good outcomes that determines whether you are winning . "
Pirate Empires was a game of exploration, conquest and profiteering . Having been developed in the galactic rim, it proved to be a breakout hit and became a rim-wide phenomenon . Riding on its success, the developer actively published countless of expansion packs, add-ons and star sector-specific flavor packages over the years .
The premise of the game was that players took on the role of an outfit leader . The only choice provided by the base game used to be a pirate captain, but later expansions added the option of playing as a legitimate mercenary commander or the leader of a treasure hunting expedition .
Whatever the case, the goal of the game was to amass a set amount of wealth in money or assets through killing, plundering, cheating, or hundreds of other ways allowed by the rules . All of this took place in the frontier beyond the border of human space .
Ves never paid too much attention to this game in his youth, but he played a few matches here and there . Recently, he gained a lot more appreciation of the game because it served as a somewhat accurate depiction of what the owner of an outfit had to deal with . The game treated the frontier as a region where opportunity and danger coexisted .
"Let's begin . I've waited long enough to get this session started!"
The four players chose their roles and began to make their first moves into the untamed stars . Each of them picked the exact same roles as last time . Everyone's choices appeared to reflect their personalities .
As a chief technician, Haine always leaned towards playing a pirate . The key to running a successful pirate operation was to keep your unruly subordinates under your thumb . Haine had a lot of experience knocking some sense into the skulls of mech technicians .
"What's the difference between a pirate and a mech technician?" She asked one day . "A pirate is led by a lawless maniac while a mech technician is led by a lawful maniac!"
Haine's usual strategy leveraged her skill in managing all kinds of bastards and scum to amass a pirate fleet in the early phases of the game . If the other three players let her build up a veritable armada, then it was too late to stop her from steamrolling them one by one .
The chief engineer pursued the opposite strategy . Avanaeon pursued quality over quantity, and therefore opted to play as a mercenary commander . His outfit always stayed small, but through a steady accumulation of wealth through low and medium-risk ventures, he amassed a collection of elite mechs and ships, all crewed by some of the skilled and deadliest subordinates available in the game .
"The best hardware paired with the best people trumps anything you can throw in my way . "
Avanaeon knew his ships well, and invested in them very early . This allowed him to pick and choose his battles and avoid any attacks directed against him in the first half of the game . He would never be the first player to fall in every match .
The only logistical officer among them favored playing as the leader of a treasure hunting outfit . Different from pirates which usually raided other players or neutral human presences on the map, treasure hunters aimed to raid the unclaimed bounties of the stars . Treasure hunters strictly challenged the environment and often explored the most hazardous regions on the map .
"You fellows fight too much . " Soapstone often remarked . "This game is about hoarding the most wealth . Taking it from someone else all the time only builds up grievances among your enemies . "
That said, Soapstone did not fare very well once she entered a bad encounter against another human force . Her force mix predominantly focused on strengthening her landbound combat and exploration capacities, while most of her ships focused on maximizing their cargo capacity .
Each of the three had been familiar with each other since accepting their postings aboard the Shield of Hispania . One day, Chief Haine invited Ves to join their little circle, and out of curiosity he accepted the offer .
He quickly became immersed into the game . What he used to play for fun in the past served as a fun way to practice running his own outfit someday .
Harkening back to the Avatars of Myth he founded a while ago, Ves opted to play as a mercenary commander as well . In the first sessions, he experimented with a variety of strategies, but eventually settled on taking steady missions while preparing for a high-risk high-reward treasure hunting opportunity .
"Since this is just a game, I can go wild . I always love to make a big gamble . "
It was safe to say that Ves played a very risky game . He generally aimed to grow his mercenary corps as fast as possible without taking too much risks at the start . He preferred to go for mid-game value for money when acquiring new mechs and ships . This allowed him to tackle a big treasure hunting score when his search had finally stumbled upon a promising opportunity .
Anything could go wrong in these treasure hunting expeditions . From battling fire dragons while attempting to mine valuable exotics from a lava planet, to braving the risks of diving into the upper layers of a gas giant to harvest valuable concentrations of a very rare component ingredient of extreme-density fuel, his operations was always one step away from disaster .
His track record so far didn't look very good . In the current session, Ves bumped into a treasure hunting opportunity fairly early and was forced to go for it before others snatched his opportunity . His understrength collection of mechs suffered a lot of casualties on the field .
"Why do you insist on these stupid gambles?" Chief Avanaeon asked for the umpteenth time . "Chief Haine is snowballing again . I could have used to cut her pirate fleet down to size . "
Ves smiled ruefully as his latest venture appeared to be heading nowhere . "I'm not in the right position to help . It's not my fault my mercenary corps spawned on the other side of the map . "
The chief technician practically beat the chief engineer black and blue in the game . Playing pirates well required a good heaping of luck as well as excellent people management skills . Though Chief Haine's luck seemed to be average, her ability lent itself well in gathering a horde of low-quality pirate assets for an early game advantage .
Just now, she halved Avanaeon's forces and even added a couple of salvaged mechs to her own retinue . After this victory, Chief Haine began to focus on subduing other pirate gangs with higher quality ships and mechs .
Soapstone ignored the chaos that had erupted elsewhere and focused on taking commissions from foreign states to prospect valuable exotics for them to mine .
Ves on the other hand received a heavy thrashing from his initial failed venture . His mercenary corps licked their wounds while he accepted a couple of easier assignments . He never lost heart, though . As long as nobody hunting him down, he was still in contention .
That didn't change the fact that his mercenary corps had fallen behind compared to the other players . The only way he could salvage this unlucky turn of events was to roll the proverbial dice again . He prepared another his forces to go on another high-risk mission .
"Oh come on, do you really think that will work, Larkinson?"
"Hey, don't count me out yet . I'm the comeback kid . "
"Huff, if you're the combat kid, why are the repairs of our mechs behind schedule?" Chief Haine bit back . "Major Verle went through all that trouble sending our landbound mech pilots into a crash course on how to pilot spaceborn mechs . Some of them are pretty talented and decent at it, but they don't have any mechs to pilot!"
Each formally-trained mech pilot trained to pilot the machines for more than a decade . Every mech pilot acquired a basic proficiency on piloting landbound, aerial, spaceborn and in some cases aquatic mechs .
The only snag was that mech pilots usually specialized fairly early . Piloting mechs on land was easier and more intuitive, so it attracted a lot of mech pilots . Those who opted to train in piloting spaceborn mechs tended to be more skilled and better learners .
Thus, getting spaceborn pilots to crosstrain into piloting landbound mechs was easy . Forcing landbound mech pilots into becoming proficient in piloting spaceborn mechs proved to be a massive challenge .
So far, Major Verle tentatively trained up over fifty cross-rained mech pilots that showed enough competency in the simulations to survive the first five minutes of a battle . That was better than nothing .
"Hah!" Ves erupted into a cheer . "My expedition hit the jackpot!"
His mercenary corps excavated an ancient alien ruin that held a bounty of interesting alien technology . Ves could easily trade his gains to the MTA or CFA for a very high price . Once his mercenary corps extracted from the dangerous planet that held the ruins, they bee-lined to a star system occupied by the CFA and redeemed his findings for an incredible amount of credits .
It was enough to expand his mercenary corps by five-hundred percent!
"You better ready yourselves for a fight, because here I come!"
Chapter 552
Ves instantly catapulted to the top, but that didn't necessarily secured his win . He was still far short of reaching the victory condition for the game, so he had no choice but to transform his newly-gained wealth into strengthening his battle capabilities .
With a much-expanded force of mid-range ships and mechs, Ves experienced a renaissance which he took full advantage off to batter Chief Haine's increasingly formidable pirate armada . It was a shame that Chief Avanaeon's elite mercenary force beggared off at this time .
"Avanaeon, scuttlebutt says that the slapdash installation of the FTL drives on our logistics ships is coming back to bite us . Is there any credence to this rumor?"
The engineer grunted . "All the chief engineers are pulling double duty in trying to keep those shoddy FTL drives in one piece . What do you expect? They're simply the wrong fit for the Beggar's Bounty and the Linever Swan . To a mech designer like you, it's like putting an engine for a light mech into a medium mech . The FTL drives constantly break something after each and every jump . That's why we've suffered so many many delays recently . "
This sounded very worrisome to the other occupants of the compartments . "Do we need to open the stockpiles for the repair effort?"
"No, it's fine . The lack of materials is not an issue . The main challenge we are grappling with is that we don't have a good understanding of FTL technology ourselves . Even the best of humanity hasn't figured out all the nuances, so us poor engineers from a backwater third-rate state are only scratching the surface in this field . "
"Aren't chief engineers supposed to master FTL theory?" Soapstone followed up .
Avanaeon laughed . "Impossible! You'll have to be as smart as a three-hundred year old theoretical physicist to understand maybe twenty percent of how FTL drives work . Engineers like us make do with maybe five percent . We mainly learn what each component of an FTL drive is suppose to do and how it should look like . Unlike mech designers, we don't need to understand the underlying workings of FTL drives in order to get it to work . "
"So you are essentially treating FTL drives as black boxes?" Ves asked .
Even though he knew that engineers didn't comprehensively grasp the theory of FTL travel, he severely underestimated how little they actually knew .
The thought disconcerted him a lot more than he thought . After all, he wouldn't be happy to know if he rode a shuttle piloted by someone who never graduated from piloting school .
"You don't want to mess around with FTL drives . One faulty component can cause a ship to get lost in the higher dimensions for centuries . That's the least-bad outcome by the way . It's much more likely to get dropped out of FTL only to get sucked into a random black hole . What a way to go . "
Everyone shuddered a bit at the thought .
Chief Haine's attempt to beat back the sudden incursion from Ves succeeded, but at great cost . Her pirate fleet lost most of their low-quality scum . Despite being used as sacrificial pawns, the stupid pirates rabidly held up the rear guard and fought to the death .
The strengthened mercenary corps owned by Ves lost a lot of time chewing through the cannon fodder . By the time they shrugged off the pirate scum, Chief Haine's elites had already made a getaway .
In the meantime, Chief Avanaeon's mercenaries actively hunted for Lieutenant Commander Soapstone's treasure hunting expedition . They followed the trail of breadcrumbs into uncharted territory and through sheer luck managed to arrive at the right star system .
"Hey! That's not fair!" Soapstone slammed her fist against the table . The vibration from the impact briefly scrambled the projection of the game . "Out of thirty-nine star systems your fleet could have jumped to, how come you picked the right one?!"
"I'm just lucky, haha!" Avanaeon laughed as he sent his elite mercenaries to decimate Soapstone's civilian-grade ships . "Prepare your booty, because I'm coming to take them all!"
Soapstone's expedition had been caught in the middle of a planetary exploration phase and faced two difficult choices . Either she could abandon her considerable landbound assets and preserve all of her ships, or she could make a stand in an attempt to buy enough time to evacuate her landbound forces .
The first option led to guaranteed survivor, but represented a major setback . The second option might cause her to bow out of this game .
The former option wasn't even a viable choice at all . Chief Engineer Avanaeon loved to run with very fast ships, so there was no running from his pursuit .
The outcome of the battle arrived quickly enough . Soapstone hadn't devoted enough resources to defend her fleet from spaceborn threats and paid for it . Even though Avanaeon fought with a diminished force of mechs, their outstanding quality allowed him to defeat the much more fragile ships and mechs of Soapstone's treasure hunting expedition .
The logistical officer was the first player to be taken out of the game .
"You lucky dog . "
"Good game . "
With three players left in the game, the session transitioned into the late game phase . Every side accumulated a core force of high quality people and assets . Instead of racing to accumulate enough wealth to satisfy the victory condition of the game, everyone tried to hunt each other in order to take their opponents out directly .
"Come on, Haine . Where is your mighty pirate fleet?"
"I'm swaggering towards you! Just you wait! Our final battle will soon begin!"
"Speaking of final battles, how high are the odds we'll be forced into a battle against the Hafner Duchy?" Avanaeon asked .
"My gut feeling tells me that Hafner won't let us go without a fight . " Haine remarked . "I've managed to survive up to now by listening to my gut feeling, so you better take my warning seriously . "
Ves shrugged at that as he drove his mercenary corps in a search pattern . "I've studied Hafner's strategies extensively, and one thing that stands out is that they've erected a massive monitoring web at the border between the Kingdom and the Reinald Republic . According to Miss Jupiter, there's no way the local rebels can sabotage this monitoring network . We'll definitely trip an alarm as soon as our ships near the border . "
"Hafner has a reputation for responding quickly to alerts . Their ships catch up fast . "
"I'm very concerned about Hafner . All the information I've read about them suggests that they are zealous pirate hunters . Added to the fact that they know we'll have to cross their borders, they'll be ready to take us out . Frankly speaking, if not for the two-month deadline of our mission, we should have tried to go around and avoid this territory entirely . "
After jumping through several star systems, Ves finally cornered Haine's pirate fleet . A massive battle ensued as both sides fought to the death .
One of the more annoying aspects of Haine's pirates was that she always managed to max out their loyalty scores . The last time he played pirate, all of his subordinates deserted him once he sustained twenty percent losses . The gutless pirates under his command showed no appreciation for his command .
Mercenaries fit better with his playstyle anyway . Most mercenaries possessed a sense of honor, and if nothing else they were lured by generous pay and hefty pensions for their loved ones should they fall .
Right now, his mercenaries gained the edge . Pirate elites or not, criminals mainly sourced their mechs and ships from the black market, which wasn't known for their quality control . At least a fourth of the hardware that Chief Haine bought from a pirate station suffered a malfunction during the battle .
"Those numbskull profiteers! Isn't it too much to ask for me to get what I paid for?!"
Ves laughed at that as his forces slowly gained the advantage . "That's pirates for you . They're utterly lawless . Without the need for the MTA to certify their mechs, they can pull off any scam they can get away with . I can think of a million ways to fleece my customers if I have no morals . "
"Pff . Mech designers . Always thinking about profit before duty . "
"Well, you are about to lose!" Ves replied, not taking offense at her jeer .
The battle took a sudden turn when the Chief Engineer showed up out of nothing . His reconstituted force of elite mercenaries instantly dove into the battle .
"Haine! Truce?"
"Sure! Let's kick this arrogant mech designer's butt!"
"Avenaeon! That's low! Fighting alongside pirates is a great taboo!"
"Not if we keep our distance!" Avenaeon responded with a grin . "Besides, once I clean up your dinky little mercenary corps, I'll immediately prove my law-abiding ways by finishing off what you started . "
The chief technician and chief engineer were in cahoots with each other . It made sense to gang up on Ves to them because his mercenary corps was the strongest force by a fair margin . One-on-one, neither of the chiefs could match the strength of his mercenary corps .
The battle ended in a tragedy for Ves . He'd been too eager to seek a final confrontation, and he didn't expect Chief Avenaeon to join the fun so quickly .
"The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind! Tough luck, Ves, but this time you're the mantis!"
"Good game, but how the hell did your fleet arrive at the battle so quickly? I was certain that I could have finished off the pirates before you arrived . "
"There are lots of tricks you can pull off with certain FTL drive models if you're willing to burn them out . I performed an ultra-long-ranged transition at double their effective range . I can cover twice the distance at the same amount of time . The only downside is that navigation is gone to hell . I lost over thirty percent of my fleet to the tides of the higher dimensions . "
"Damn . Well, at least I've learned something new . "
With Ves out of the way, Haine's badly battered pirates contended evenly against Avenaeon's elite mercenaries . As a last hurrah, Ves had ordered his mercenaries to focus their final moments into crippling the enemy mercenaries . Since Avenaeon already lost thirty percent of his forces from botched FTL transitions, he really didn't have a lot of mechs at his disposal .
Haine managed to retrieve her malfunctioning mechs and kludged a number fixes together that restored their fighting strength . Those extra mechs tipped the scales in her favor, causing her to be the ultimate winner of this session .
"Good game . " Avanaeon said, being gracious enough to concede the win to Haine .
"Yeah! Go team pirates!"
The losers at the table grumbled a bit as they raised their comms and transferred five hundred credits to Chief Haine's account .
"I'll earn that money back next time, so don't spend them yet!"
"Keep on dreaming, Soapstone!"
After wrapping up the game, they retired to the sofas and shared a few drinks . An hour later, Ves departed from the lounge to call it a night .
When Chief Haine initially invited him to these little gaming sessions, he only accepted out of a social obligation . Each session ran for at least an hour, which was precious time that Ves could have spent on furthering the repairs of the task force's mechs .
It was only after he attended the first couple of sessions that Ves realized the value of these informal gatherings . Everyone invited to the games served a vital function aboard the Shield of Hispania .
Everyone had a tendency to loosen their lips during the gaming sessions . Ves learned a wealth of information from key personnel that he would have never gotten wind of in his regular capacity .
Naturally, the others expected him to reciprocate, so he returned the favor with some semi-critical nuggets of information from time to time . He was glad that everyone knew their limits . Nobody leaked a word of classified information unless all four of them possessed the right clearances .
Through these regular off-duty meetings, Ves pieced together Major Verle's plan for Hafner .
The mech officer came up with a bold plan . Instead of letting Hafner come to them, the Vandals would take the fight to Hafner! In other words, they planned to surprise the duchy by launching a surprise attack against one of their worlds!
The Flagrant Vandals feared Hafner for a very good reason. As a border territory of the Vesia Kingdom, the Hafner Duchy differed a lot from the interior duchies.
First and foremost, their main responsibility was to guard the border. Military priorities came first, everything else came second. Thus, it did not matter too much if the border star systems failed to turn a profit. As long as they maintained a sufficient garrison to deter pirate raids and the like, it was fine if they lost a substantial amount of money over time.
The Vesian propensity for infighting was remarkably subdued in the border territories. It was the same at the Bright Republic’s side of the border. With the threat of external enemies so acute, the noble Houses that controlled the border systems had no time to wage pointless rivalries amongst themselves.
Another stabilizing influence was that the Kingdom as a whole subsidized the border territories by funding the military forces that kept the borders safe. This extra income came with many responsibilities, but in turn the noble Houses fielded substantially more mechs than their holdings could support.
Who would want to disturb such a good arrangement? Therefore, most of the star systems in the Hafner Duchy were relatively tranquil, and focused most of their efforts into repelling pirates and foreign invaders.
Furthermore, the differences extended to the regional rebel movements that agitated against the Vesians in Hafner. Iris explained the difference to Ves one day.
"Sir, the rebels in territories like Imodris and Venidse are fighting back against injustice, oppression and inequality. Like my Jupiter family, we are often impacted by these elements, driving us out of the light to seek solace in the dark. Our only goal is to work towards an upheaval in the Kingdom that will lead to the abolishment of the rule of nobles."
Good luck with that, Ves silently thought. Having sampled Vesian culture up close, his impressions of the Kingdom led him to believe that the noble Houses were like inextinguishable roots that had tightly gripped the state they derived their nutrients from. Destroying this pervasive system of governance could only be done if the entire Kingdom fell one day.
That would never happen.
"I’m familiar with this pattern." Ves replied, keeping his opinions about the viability of the rebel cause to himself. "A border territory such as Hafner is run very differently. Rebel movements are more than a nuisance in this kind of place. They can directly threaten their national security. This encourages the Houses here work harder to minimize discontent among the commoners. Receiving all of those subsidies makes this choice a lot easier to pursue."
"That’s exactly right, boss. Yet despite these circumstances, rebel movements still exist in the border territories. Do you know how they are able to remain aloft?"
Ves crunched his brow. He gained some familiarity with Hafner, but he mostly studied their mech doctrine and their mech models. He hadn’t looked too closely at the local rebels, as the central database didn’t contain all that much information about them. The Mech Corps focused mostly on gathering intelligence on the border territories adjacent to the Bright Republic. They couldn’t afford to allocate too many resources to study a border region on the opposite side of the Kingdom.
"I can’t figure it out at the top of my head."
"Then let me tell you the answer, sir. It’s the Reinald Republic. They’ve directly slipped their tentacles in the rebel movements that are causing quite some grief to the Duke of Hafner!"
"That sounds dangerously like an act of war! The Vesians shouldn’t tolerate such a brazen effort at destabilizing their own territories!"
Iris shook her head. "It’s much more complicated than that. Even though Hafner is pretty sure where the local rebels are getting their funding and support, there’s never any hard proof of such. Testimonies are worthless because people can be brainwashed. Recordings are also worthless because they can be manipulated with ease. With how careful Reinald conducts their business, there is no way for Hafner to put the blame on their neighboring state."
"If these rebels are supported by Reinald on the sly, does that mean they are agitating for Hafner to be annexed by their masters?"
"Correct." She nodded. "There’s a large amount of genuine Reinald sympathizers among the lower ranks of these movements. They think that all of their troubles will magically be relieved once they’ve separated from the Vesians and joined the Reinaldans. The upper management on the other hand are likely plants from Reinald. There’s not a single bone of integrity in their bodies."
From the tone of her voice, Ves gathered that Iris didn’t hold the Hafner rebels in high regard. "Why does it sound as if you don’t respect them very much?"
"Because they’re foreign agents in all but name! What they want is very different from what the VRF and the other regional rebel movements want. Though our opinions differ a little among ourselves, It’s not our intention to break apart the Kingdom and integrate with another state. We are Vesians, and we will not allow our unique identity to be subsumed by others."
She didn’t need to say that this counted for the Bright Republic as well. The Vesians would never accept the rule of Brighters, especially since their animosity against each other had grown over several centuries.
Ves still believed that they cause had no way of succeeding though, especially if they explicitly refused outside help. Their delusion was on par with the Bentheim Liberation Movement’s fantasy of ruling the Bentheim region as a separate state.
"What about their mechs? Since they local rebels are being funded by the Reinald Republic, they must surely have some teeth."
"Oh, it’s nothing special. Their mechs aren’t any better from what you’ve seen in Imodris and Venidse. You have to realize that Hafner excels in tracking down pirates. If the rebels attempt to play the same game, they’ll be hunted down and exterminated sooner or later. They play a very different role. While their battle capabilities are rather plain, they’ve infiltrated nearly every layer of Hafner society. There’s no better source of insider information than their spies."
This was key information that Iris only revealed in an off-hand manner. Ves thought back on his suspicion that Major Verle planned to conduct an offensive raid on one of Hafner’s star system. If the Vandals wanted to insure this operation went well, they couldn’t go without sufficient intelligence.
"Is the VRF involved with negotiating with the local rebels for something?"
"I can’t tell you that. Every conversation I have on behest of Major Verle is confidential, you know. Even if you’re my boss, I’m still a guest here."
Ves nodded in understanding. "Is acting as a liaison to foreigners something that happens often?"
"Yes. In the VRF, it’s actually considered a way to ascend the hierarchy. There are many people like me.who hunger for more. We can apply to various kinds of duties in order to earn more recognition. As long as we do a good job, we’ll earn more trust which in turn will translate into more responsibilities."
"Sounds like maintaining relations with foreigners is very important for the VRF."
She sighed. "Waging a war against the Vesian feudal system can’t be done by ourselves. We’re sober enough to realize that, or else our organization would have been wiped out by now. I can’t tell you how many states we are in contact with, but it’s much more than you think."
This means that the VRF likely reached out to states beyond those that bordered the Kingdom! Ves felt as if this was another important detail that he inadvertently learned. Iris wasn’t too careful in her speech.
"How are you guys able to remain focused on your goal when you are treating with so many foreigners? I can imagine that the VRF is introducing more and more competing interests."
"It’s a challenge, but it’s also a necessity, sir." She said. "We won’t be able to realize our goals in the short-term, so we just have to build up the conditions that are necessary for an uprising to succeed. Foreign aid allows us to maintain our strength and get to that point faster. As long as we continue to gain benefits, our ultimate goal will be realized some day. We never lose hope."
That sounded a bit too optimistic to Ves. With all the money that changed hands within the VRF, there was doubtlessly a subset of the rebels who profited from these arrangements. They might not necessarily want to stop once they had a taste of wealth.
Still, that had nothing to do with Ves. As a citizen of the Bright Republic, Ves considered the VRF and the other rebel movements as a convenient weapon against their mortal enemy. To them, anything that hindered the Vesians should be lauded.
"Let’s get back to Hafner. Whatever the Flagrant Vandals are about to do, it will likely concern the local rebels. I know you can’t tell me anything directly, but are the Reinald-backed rebels good to work with?"
Iris pressed her lips into a thin line. Obviously she didn’t hold them in very high regard. "Don’t conflate us who are genuinely standing up for the commoners to those planted agents who pretend they care. The rebel leadership in Hafner merely want to exchange one group of tyrants with another one."
"That’s strange. I haven’t heard any bad things about Reinald. Sure, they’re a little small and poor, but they’re not so different from any other republic in our star sector."
"That’s because you don’t see what lies underneath. You’ve learned before that Reinald is secretly encouraging pirate attacks against Hafner, right? You can say that Reinald is a hotbed of illegal activity. It’s a state with one foot in the light and one foot firmly in the dark. Their grey markets and black markets make up half of the wealth that flows through their hands."
Ves couldn’t believe that the situation was exaggerated to that degree. Wouldn’t that make Reinald a pirate state? The MTA would never tolerate such a thing!
"If Reinald is so bad, how come I haven’t heard of their bad reputation?"
"Oh, they’re very good at hiding their misdeeds behind their proper appearances. They’ve mastered the art of duplicity I should say. They are master cheaters and master tradesmen. Haggling with a merchant from Reinald is like giving away half your money. Don’t ever get pulled into their traps. If you want to trade anything with a Reinaldan, you better hire another Reinaldan to negotiate on your behalf. It’s as if their entire state consists of swindlers."
The animosity displayed by Iris truly reached an extreme degree. Ves unconsciously took a step back. He should definitely dive into the galactic net and conduct a more thorough research on the state that the Verle Task Force was desperate to reach.
Still, Ves was careful enough to take her words with a grain of salt. Even in the future, biases and prejudices couldn’t be eradicated. Humans always felt the need to categorize different groups into neatly labelled categories.
"Let’s get back to work. We still have a lot of repair work left on our plate."
After more than a month without any battles, the task force managed to gain a lot of headway into reducing their backlog. While the persistent shortages of resources, equipment and skilled manpower prevented them from repairing every wreck, the Vandals weren’t as pathetic as before. Unlike a month ago, they could actually put up a competent defense against spaceborn assets.
The mood among the surviving Vandals had also lifted somewhat. The earlier period of gloom had mostly faded through the passage of time. The Vandals soldiered on and let the routine of their duties distract them from any dark thoughts.
Ves admired their resilience against depression. Though other units might have managed to regain their spirits faster, the Vandals showed their pedigree as a military mech regiment. Behind their sloppy veneer was a spine of steel.
Lately, the Verle Task Force started to meander in Hafner space. Ves believed that the Vandals didn’t want Hafner to know where they planned to go. This was why the fleet took a lot of detours that didn’t bring them closer to the border.
To an outside observer, it might have appeared that the task force desperately wanted to cross the border, but withheld from taking action because they needed to accumulate more strength. The meandering routes the task force followed didn’t take them anywhere special.
Ves believed that was exactly the point. Through various hints and deductions, most of which he picked up from the meetups where he played Pirate Empires, he suspected that Major Verle actually aimed for a target that was very near to their current location.
"The Flagrant Vandals are always the ones who take the initiative. It’s not in their nature to be passive and react to circumstances that are thrust upon them. The battles against the Calico Dancer Bats and the Frosty Meteors serve as proof of this pattern. I can imagine that all raiding regiments are like this. They are only comfortable when they are the attackers."
The messy but eventual success of the Detemen Operation showed how strong the Vandals could be. As long as they made the right preparations, they were capable of inflicting a devastating amount of damage while making off with an abundant amount of loot.
The only way to break the trap that Hafner prepared for the task force was to do something different, and the only course of action that made sense to him was to conduct a daring raid.
Still, attempting to attack any occupied star system in the Hafner Duchy came with a lot of peril. Most of the star systems in Imodris had lost their wariness against foreign invaders. It wouldn’t be strange to see them panic at the sight of the Flagrant Vandals, especially if their defense force was inadequate.
The people who lived under the rule of Hafner didn’t suffer from any doubts. Pirates were just like bullies, who kept visiting the same old chumps over and over if they acted like pushovers. Over time, the frequent pirate raids must have hardened them into putting up a ferocious fight no matter how badly the invaders outnumbered them. This was very clear in the documentation about the territory.
"That’s not the true danger, though. Any star system can be overwhelmed as long as we pick the right target. It’s the follow-up that’s a threat."
The willingness of neighboring forces to reinforce a beleaguered star system was very high. Rivalling powers wouldn’t hesitate in sending out some of their best, because they expected the same treatment in return.
Worse, the ducal authority also coordinated the defense effort. Under their centralized direction, the reinforcements not only arrived at the star system under attack, but they also gathered the star systems that formed the likely escape routes of the invaders. This vastly increased the chance of attackers tripping on their feet, allowing further Hafner reinforcements to catch up and gang up on the hindered pirates.
Every way the Flagrant Vandals could take advantage of, Hafner had a ready answer prepared. They truly weren’t easy to crack.
"Still, this should be old school to the Vandals. They won’t be stumped by these challenges."
Before embarking on the daring raid of the Detemen System, the Flagrant Vandals routinely raided the border territories along the border between the Bright Republic and the Vesia Kingdom. Though they mostly terrorized the shipping lines, they did have some experience with raiding occupied worlds.
"The Vandal landbound mechs are not for show. It’s a significant burden to maintain a landbound contingent if there aren’t many opportunities to make use of them. Planetary raids are definitely their cup of tea."
In addition, the interests of the Vandals aligned with the interests of the Reinald-backed rebels. Both sides wanted to make Hafner suffer for different reasons, but what they had in common was enough to forge a temporary understanding with each other.
"Help from the local rebels is vital for the next operation."
He already saw the signs of future action. Some time ago, Ves received orders to pull back the priority of repairing as much spaceborn mechs as possible in favor of fixing up some landbound mechs. Not a lot, but just enough to achieve some progress here.
It was a good thing that the damage sustained by the landbound mechs during the Detemen Operation didn’t amount to much compared to the heavy losses sustained by their spaceborn contingent.
Ves didn’t hesitate in allocating a couple of low-performing mech designers to fixing up the neglected landbound mechs. These mech designers lacked the knowledge, talent or willingness to learn to service the spaceborn mechs. Forcing them to work with spaceborn mechs was like forcing a gourmet to eat an unprocessed nutrient pack.
Landbound mech pilots also stepped up their training. Their readiness climbed up to a state where they wouldn’t be much weaker from the time of the Detemen Operation.
The Vandals prepared various measures and readied various supplies that was relevant to any landbound raid. The next battle surely entailed a lot of risks!
Under these circumstances, the rank-and-file smelled something afoot. Even if they were under the mistaken impression that the fleet would attempt to make a run for the border, no one remained complacent.
A large amount of mechs would soon show the Vesians their mettle. The Flagrant Vandals detested being relegated to a punching bag. They built up a lot of resentment against the Vesians. Even if they couldn’t take revenge against Imodris or Venidse, venting their fury upon Hafner was sufficient for their needs.
The servicemen in the corridors and lounges casually spoke how they looked forward to thrashing Hafner mechs. Ves paid a considerable amount of importance to their mood, and it was evident that the people at the top actively encouraged such talk in order to boost everyone’s morale.
With every piece of the puzzle falling into place, Ves had his own work to do. While a planetary raid didn’t necessarily involve any spaceborn mechs, any mildly important star system hosted a spaceborn garrison. Ves felt that it was important to keep raising their spaceborn strength.
Throughout the last month, some of the mech designers under his supervision achieved great results. Of course, it helped that Ves rewarded them generously by allowing them to borrow valuable textbooks from the central database. Some book-starved idiots even borrowed four or five books on six month terms.
Ves called them idiots because these mech designers didn’t possess any remarkable cognitive traits. Their intelligence war firmly within the range of a baseline human, which meant that completely understanding a single Journeyman-level textbook would take a couple of years.
"Six months isn’t enough to digest that much theory."
His own rapid ascension was an exception. A normal Apprentice Mech Designer slowly took the time to accumulate Journeyman-level knowledge over many years. Access to good textbooks cost a lot of money, but as long as a mech designer achieved decent results, they wouldn’t have much trouble getting their hands on one.
Thus, he understood the viewpoint of those idiots. They couldn’t bear the thought of wasting so much value by wasting their lending opportunities.
Still, in his opinion, the right choice would be to borrow a single textbook and use the other reward opportunities to receive his teachings. Ves possessed a broad range of knowledge and mastered most fundamental fields related to mech design to the level of Journeyman. If not for getting bottlenecked by other advancement requirements, Ves could long call himself a true Journeyman.
Exceptions still popped up. Ves was gratified that some low-ranking mech designers possessed sufficient vision to make use of his valuable time.
One of his most dogged fans turned out to be Loke Vedette. The poor chump that barely escaped punishment aboard the Finmoth Regal regarded Ves as his patron.
On the advice of Ves, Vedette borrowed a single comprehensive book on mechanics and spent his limited free hours into delving on the easiest aspects in the book.
"Learning good mechanics cannot be done in a day. To be frank, for someone like you, sixth months will never be enough. However, if you are dedicated and persistent in your learning, you will likely be able to understand eighty percent of its contents. That’s more than good enough at your stage. After that, you should try to round up your other fundamentals to the same level before going back to mechanics to tackle the remaining twenty percent."
Vedette’s projection looked confused at Ves. "Why not tell me to study the textbook until I understand all of it? I can work hard to earn the right to extend my borrowing term, sir!"
"That’s no good. The last portion of knowledge is often the hardest to comprehend, especially when you talk about a broad and expansive field like mechanics. To truly master this knowledge, you need some tempering with realspace practice. Service more mechs. Help out with the design of one. Apply the knowledge that you have learned from the book and you will find that the twenty percent that is the hardest to understand will fall into place in your mind."
A light went off in Vedette. "I understand! Theory and practice can’t be separated from each other!"
This was how most mech designers learned when they didn’t possess a cheat like the System that simply crammed the requisite knowledge in his mind.
"Our time is very precious, so let’s move on with the tutoring. If I recall, you’ve reached the chapter where the book begins to explain the interaction between the engine and artificial muscles of a mech. Have you stumbled on any hangups here?"
The other mech designer frowned. "The theory sounds simple enough, but when I try to apply what I’ve learned in designing my own mech from practice, it all seems to fall apart."
"Show me your progress."
After Vedette showed him his practice designs, Ves had to force his face into an immovable rock. The amount of mistakes he made in every single aspect about designing mechs really made him want to cringe.
"This is... a decent work for someone who isn’t experienced with designing an original mech. You’re still stuck in the phase where you’re only able to design variants, right?"
"That is so, sir. Before the Mech Corps picked me up, I didn’t do very well for myself. Opportunities are hard to come by for a fresh graduate."
If Vedette possessed actual talent, then he wouldn’t have any trouble making ends meet. In truth, the struggling mech designer hadn’t reached the minimum standard for Ves to consider hiring after they finished their stint with the Mech Corps.
Still, his earnestness and his willingness to learn put Vedette into a very short list of hopefuls. He might not amount to much right now, but a couple of years later the situation might be different.
Ves kept his eye on these potential seeds, and worked to increase his relations with them in case their potential blossomed in the future.
No one else among the Flagrant Vandals ever paid as much attention to them as Ves.
He continued to tutor Vedette in earnest. Of course, Ves held a lot of knowledge back for his junior’s own good. Near the end of their one-hour session, Ves asked a pertinent question to his potential protege.
"What do you envision yourself as doing when the war is over?"
"Will the war ever end so easily? Sometimes I think that this war will never end."
"In a way, our war against the Vesians have never ended since our state was founded. But that’s not important right now. Try and cast your mind to the future. What do you think you’ll do?"
"I don’t know. My experience with the Mech Corps will account for something, but I don’t have the qualifications to get accepted by a prestigious mech manufacturer. I don’t have the confidence to start my own business either, not that anyone would lend me the funding needed to purchase equipment and license a design. My future isn’t as bright as yours."
Ves leaned forward and stared at his projection. "What if I can make it brighter?"
Ves paid a lot of attention to the general mood of the Vandals. The servicemen he walked past and ate next to in the mess hall or the more ornate dining room when Major Verle wanted to hold a social occasion all expressed their opinions without much inhibition.
He thought this was a special feature of the Flagrant Vandals. Every mech regiment carefully constructed their moniker and religiously followed it after establishing one. As their moniker suggested, they embodied the ideal of behaving flagrantly.
"They’re crude, but they’re also honest."
He admired that about the Vandals. Everyone felt free to express their true opinions, even if they broke some unspoken taboos. This allowed Ves to judge the general undercurrent of the crew of the Shield of Hispania.
"Still, I’m only sampling what the Vandals aboard the Shield of Hispania are talking about. The people serving on the other vessels of the task force might hold different opinions."
Throughout all of these changes, Ves sensed them to be deliberate and directed. He had no doubt that Major Verle manipulated the mood according to the circumstances. From staying aboard the same ship as the mech officer and seeing his leadership style up close, Ves learned that Verle was a deft master at manipulating morale.
Ves found it curious if this was the reason Colonel Lowenfield appointed Major Verle as her second in command. Their different strong points complimented each other nicely.
"By all accounts, Colonel Lowenfield is a number cruncher and a glorified accountant. She’s also a norm who lacks the aptitude to pilot a mech. She’s earned the respect of the Vandals somehow by cleaning up the mech regiment, but that doesn’t mean she’s a miracle worker. She still needs a lackey who can represent the mech pilots and command them in battle."
The leadership structure of the Flagrant Vandals roused his interest because he saw that it was something worth emulating. Before entering the service, Ves founded the Avatars of Myth as his personal force. Though Ves initially intended them to be a company-sized force of forty mechs, that wasn’t the limit of his ambitions.
"Once I’ve entered a higher gradation of power and wealth, it’s necessary for me to expand my coterie of thugs."
It wasn’t out of the question for him to expand the Avatars of Myth from an obscure personal force into a full-blown regiment-sized force. Ves might even register them as a mercenary corps in order to take advantage of the provisions of the Mercenary Association.
"Strength is the foundation of power. Wealth and talent in mech design can’t save my life if someone has me at gunpoint. The only way I can secure my safety in these times is if I convert some of my earnings into actual strength. Once I’ve reached that point, I’ll have sufficient power to do what I want."
People excelled in different vocations. The Flagrant Vandals gathered those of different talents and put them at the top in order to run a mech regiment that was capable of putting an entire planet into disarray.
At the moment, Ves recognized all the signs.
For a while now, every Vandal slowly pumped themselves up for a fight. Morale throughout the task force couldn’t get much higher from this point. In a couple of days at most, it would reach a peak where everyone entered their highest states.
"This peak morale can’t be sustained forever. Someone who’s looking for a fight but isn’t getting one will crash sooner or later."
With the task force’s current position, Ves could extrapolate the potential raiding targets Major Verle had in mind. He didn’t do so though because the major would definitely inform him very soon.
"I’ll have to get everyone prepped for a battle anyhow."
While the Vandals always prepped their mechs for battle, anticipating an encounter beforehand was very useful. Ves went back to his office and drafted a series of orders that increased the battle readiness of their mechs on a temporary basis.
This amounted to actions such as slightly overcharging energy cells and applying a special coating that helped a little bit with radiating heat but tended to degrade over a week.
All of these measures meant more busywork for the mech technicians, and they didn’t even increase the battle power of the mechs by much. "It will only be a one or two percent difference at most."
Still, Ves thought this was a worthwhile tradeoff. It wasn’t as if the mech technicians would be able to restore any more mechs up to this point. By now, they completed all of the easy repairs, leaving only the tough cases untouched. Fixing any of those mechs required much more manpower and assets.
"They should really be handed over to the Wolf Mother. Only a base facility or a full-fledged factory ships can restore those badly beaten mechs."
The only other alternative was to recycle the wrecks into their base materials and fabricate a new mech anew. This was something which the Beggar’s Bounty and the Linever Swan could only do on an emergency basis, and was highly inefficient.
"I really miss the Wolf Mother. It’s like a mobile version of the Mech Nursery."
Factory ships had their uses, but they tend to be extremely big, slow and delicate. It only took a couple of torpedos to thrash the capital ship-sized monstrosity.
"Well, it’s a good thing we’ve become used to working under scarcity."
The mech technicians and mech designers in the task force slowly mastered some tricks which enabled them to be more frugal with their limited resources. Waste had been cut to a minimum, and Ves had even taught his underlings some methods to substitute rare materials with more common ones with the help of his Jury Rigging Sub-Skill.
"Without Jury Rigging, we would have long become starved with critical resources."
It highlighted the dire state of their material stockpiles. They faced massive shortages in many categories. Repairing some mechs was simply out of the question because they lacked the minimum amount of exotics to restore the functionality of a critical component.
Many other mechs made do with a patchwork of different armor formulas. The Vandals didn’t have the right ingredients to reproduce the more expensive armor systems, so they resorted to cheaper ones and hoped the coating applied on top of it successfully obscured their inadequacies.
To Ves, it felt like he was committing fraud. The people in charge of certifying mechs at the MTA would vomit if they ever encountered one of these patchwork mechs.
"They’re ugly, but as long as they can fight, they’re good enough."
There was a serious downside to transforming regular mechs into patchwork mechs. It deviated a machine from a proscribed design into uncharted territory. The older a mech, the more its imperfections led to unique variations of the standard design. Yet utilizing jury-rigged solutions introduced a lot more changes than usual, to the point where mechs stopped resembling their original model.
In the short-term, creating pathwork mechs helped increase the immediate battle power of the mech regiment. In the long-term, these mechs would slowly become more unusable due to the inability to apply newer updates onto the deviating designs.
The only way to make use of them was to revert all of the changes, which was a lot of work for some mechs. In some cases, it might be better to scrap them entirely or relegate them into a disposable role.
"If we aren’t so desperate to increase our strength, I wouldn’t have resorted to this measure."
Nonetheless, Ves didn’t live in a perfect reality. He often had to resort to desperate choices that came with a price.
Some time later, Ves corresponded with Pierce, who was the highest-ranking mech designer aboard the Beggar’s Bounty.
"Has the Beggar’s Bounty received any strange orders lately?" He asked at the start.
"Nothing except for one strange order, sir. Some higher-ups ordered us to cobble together a large number of artificial meteorites. Do you remember our previous stop where we’ve delayed out next transition in order to mine a nearby asteroid belt? That’s because we had to gather as much junk as possible in order to create a bunch of artificial meteorites on the fly."
"Do these artificial asteroids come with any specifications?"
"No. They told us to stick to a standard metal rock. It was more important to create as much of them as possible."
"How many?"
"Over fifty and counting."
Ves widened his eyes a bit. Fifty artificial meteorites was more than enough to pummel a large city into dust and ruin!
In fact, sending all of them onto a planet at once risked drawing the ire of the MTA! Major Verle was really playing with fire at this moment!
"This isn’t something regular at all, Pierce. Do you feel uncomfortable being ordered to create so many artificial meteorites on order?"
The other mech designer’s projection shrugged. "As mech designers, we aren’t culpable for the crimes our customers commit. It’s the same thing with the artificial meteorites. If the MTA brings down the hammer on us, it’s the brass who will suffer a punishment, not a small figure like me who’s only a cog in the machine."
"You may not be culpable by law, but there’s also your consciousness that you have to take into account. Will you sleep easily knowing that your creations will likely be responsible for slaughtering hundreds or thousands of people in the next battle?"
"Sir, this isn’t something we should concern ourselves with." Pierce replied with a firm voice. "You should see how war is waged in the Friday Coalition. The stakes are higher there, and so are the rewards. The Coalition partners are willing to do anything to get their hands on their prize."
"Did you witness a conflict in person back when you grew up in the Coalition."
"No, but my father frequently became involved. The hotter the conflict, the more mechs his company sold. I think he even helped to fan the flames in some cases."
Ves scratched his head. What a shameless father! "Well, sounds like the Friday Coalition isn’t a pleasant place to live in if there’s so much fighting going around."
"Ah, don’t misunderstand me, Larkinson, this only happens when a region is under contention. Most regions are firmly attached to a Coalition partner, so their stability isn’t in question. Those are safe but expensive places to live. Immigrants from poorer states are outright barred from entering these star systems."
"Say, Pierce, do you ever wish to return to the Coalition?" Ves asked out of the blue.
Pierce smiled sardonically. "I don’t miss it at all. Someone like me who is without talent is a disgrace in the Coalition. It’s better if I don’t show up to shame my father."
Ves clearly understood that Pierce hid a lot of his pain on the matter. Yet for Ves to nurture Pierce as a trusted lackey, this bandaid needed to be pulled away.
"What if you had some help? You aren’t completely without potential in my eyes. As long as you study diligently and benefit from the right supplements, it’s not out of the question for you to transform from a caterpillar into a butterfly."
"Hahaha!" Pierce lost control for a moment. "Who would waste his time and money to invest in me? I’m too old to become someone’s apprentice, and finding a mentor who doesn’t want to take advantage of my father is impossibly hard!"
"Think about it for a while." Ves replied calmly. "For now, I’ve kept track of your redemptions for exceeding the weekly quotas. I’ve noticed that you’ve spent all of your opportunities on borrowing more books. Don’t you think you’ve borrowed enough? Why not take advantage of my tutoring?"
The other mech designer frowned. "Even if I don’t have the time to digest all of those books, I’ll still be able to broaden my knowledge in the short term."
"As a friend, let me give you some advice. It’s better to be really good in one thing than average in everything else. Especially at the early Apprentice stage, you should be focused on developing your specialities."
"And you can help me that, sir?"
"Why the skepticism? Since you’re a friend, I don’t mind giving you a lesson for free. Pull up the textbook that you’ve learned the most from so far and I’ll see if I can help solve some of your conundrums."
Though Pierce didn’t think that Ves would make a very good teacher, he did as asked and pulled up a virtual textbook. Ves proceeded to tutor him in areas which Pierce only understood the most shallow principles.
It didn’t take long for Pierce to become engrossed with the knowledge that Ves passed on. Ves discretely grinned as he recognized he hooked another fish.
Besides Vedette, Ves also had his eyes on Pierce. Once he had a genuine citizen from the Coalition in his grasp, Ves would be able to make more inroads in the circles of the Coalition. Even though he already benefited from his association with the Clifford Society, it never hurt to have more options.
Ves had his eyes on multiple mech designers in the task force. No matter what, the more mech designers he gathered by his side, the better off he would be at the end of the war.
A true mech design project could not be conducted alone. Ves constantly yearned to gather his own design team at the LMC. They would be able to assist him in all manner of minor tasks in the same way the Mech Corps hired massive amounts of mech designers to pad their design teams.
As long as he controlled the main aspects of his design project, the help of others shouldn’t be able to contaminate the spiritual nature of his designs.
"My Spirituality is stronger than any other mech designer, or perhaps it’s better to say that I’m stronger in the creation and manipulation of imaginary existences."
Ves already proved several times that the mechs that carried his X-Factor wouldn’t easily be contaminated by the fingerprints of other mech designers and mech technicians. Their non-existent spiritualities simply couldn’t contend with an active one.
Still, Ves suspected that higher ranking mech designers possessed their own abilities that might be tangibly be related to spirituality. "I’ll have to advance to Journeyman before I can answer this question."
It might seem strange for him to focus on his plans for the future while his survival in the coming months wasn’t guaranteed. He still had to help the task force survive the obstacles that Hafner put in their way.
"It’s never too early to lay some ground."
This was a key period in his life in which he would be able to connect with other mech designers without too much suspicion. If Ves attempted to recruit mech designers after the war, he’d face a lot more difficulties, the most important of which was to verify their loyalty.
"There is no better proof of loyalty than to put it to test in the harshest conditions."
The bonds of brotherhood he forged with the mech designers and the Vandals may lead to a lifelong advantage later on. That was something that his Larkinson heritage had taught.
For now though, Ves did not dare spend too much time on future matters. He still had a lot of work in the present to take care of. With a tired sigh, Ves returned to his regular duties.
Two days later, Major Verle finally stopped withholding his plans. He called for another massive conference meeting in which every mech captain and ship captain gathered in the same compartment via projections. The only physical people present were Ves and others assigned to the Shield of Hispania.
"I’m sure you are aware that the Hafner Duchy is alerted to our presence. From the intelligence we’ve received from the local rebels, Hafner has allocated the bulk of their uncommitted forces to the star systems near the border. Once we enter their perimeter, they’ll instantly lock on to us and converge on us with rapid tempo."
Everyone nodded. This was a standard blockade tactic that the Vesians proficiently employed when they really wanted to stop a specific target. Though it was possible for the Flagrant Vandals to escape the net, the risks were unimaginably high. At the very least, some Vandals preferred to fight another round with the Frosty Meteors rather than face the full fury of the Hafner mech legions.
"We’ve gathered a lot of intelligence on Hafner distributed their forces. Though their core systems remain heavily guarded, the substantial drawback of uncommitted forces has left many smaller star systems bereft of a comfortable buffer against raids. After discussing the possibilities with one of the local rebel groups, we’ve decided to hit a specific star system. Let me show you."
A new projection appeared above the conference table. It looked like a rather small and unremarkable place. "The Nova Migolatus System centers around a fairly normal main sequence star and has four significant planets. Nova Migolatus IV is a gas giant while Nova Migolatus I is a terraformed terrestrial planet which is also the only occupied satellite in the system. Our target is here."
The details listed next to Nova Migolatus I didn’t list anything worth raiding. Its overall development resembled Cloudy Curtain in that it was largely rural. It held a few large cities, but most people lived in towns and villages and kept the vast farms going. The planet did not host any form of heavy industry, which made it a very unattractive target for the Vandals to raid.
"This place is worthless!"
"What is there to steal here? Grains? Dirt? Farmers?"
Major Verle knocked his fist against the table, shutting everyone up. "Our goal here is not to go on another robbing spree. The truth is that we’ve accepted a commission from an influential rebel group called Peace for Hafner. Helping them in this task is scratching their back. Once we’ve given them what they want, the rebels scratch our backs in turn when the time comes for us to cross the border."
Ves narrowed his eyes at that. It left a lot of things to trust. Major Verle must be very confident for this so-called Peace for Hafner to return the favor.
"If we aren’t robbing the place dry, what are we after, sir?"
The commanding officer resumed his briefing. "If you didn’t know any better, Nova Migolatus I looks like any other rural planet. However, its highly diverse biosphere, vast stretches of mountains and hills and non-existent satellite coverage makes it a perfect place for training mech pilots how to survive in the wild. There’s a training camp on this planet, and a very special one at that."
"Our mission is to smash a training camp?"
"Not exactly. Peace for Hafner doesn’t care too much about the training camp or most of its trainees. They only care about taking out a specific person. Meet Captain Relia Foster, a mech officer of the Hafner mech legions."
A supplementary projection appeared alongside the projection of Nova Migolatus I. It showed the profile of a very attractive Vesian mech officer.
"She’s young, she’s talented, and she’s a thorn in the side of Peace for Hafner. Though Captain Foster is from common stock, it’s already a done deal for her to be elevated to a baron. That’s because she’s a verified expert candidate."
A faint gasp could be heard throughout the conference room as everyone present looked at the woman with respect. An expert candidate!
"All of you know what an expert candidate represents." Verle stated as he glanced at everyone’s expression. "They are peak advanced pilots who have pierced through the threshold that holds them back from becoming a bona fide expert pilot. When measured by precise instruments, they’ll be able to measure a resonance value of 0.00001 laveres or something. Even though that is nothing compared to an actual expert, it still represents a near-assurance of advancement."
A newly advanced expert pilot exhibited resonance that measured 1 laveres on average. These values didn’t sound very impressive, but the vast majority of mech pilots never registered anything on the lavere scale. They could forget about reaching 0.00001 for the rest of their lives.
Many mech pilots thought that they either possessed the right magic or not. No matter how much the overwhelming majority of mech pilots challenged themselves, they would never be able to scratch the wall that barred their advancement.
Major Verle continued his clarification. "An expert pilot is a strategic weapon to any state. The rise and fall of even one of them is significant enough to affect the national strength of a state. The situation is even more significant here because the duchies that make up the Kingdom never share their expert pilots. An additional expert in the ranks of Hafner will make all of their opponents tremble in fear. They won’t be as free to invade the borders and raid a seemingly defenseless star system. It only takes one expert pilot to annihilate a small-sized raiding force. A future Venerable Foster is enough to make Peace for Hafner and many other factions suffer a substantial amount of losses."
A mech captain raised his hand. "If Captain Foster is such a valuable mech pilot, won’t she have a lot of guards around her, sir? I can’t imagine Hafner would be willing to treat her as anything less than a chunk of high-grade exotic."
"Good question. The reason why I’ve decided to accept this commission is because Hafner has made some missteps. First, an expert pilot only comes about when facing a lot of stress and the threat of death. If Captain Foster is surrounded by too many guards, why would she feel any dangerous impulses? The training camp and her guards are not as overwhelming as you think. They mainly rely on secrecy to keep themselves safe. Secondly, the Nova Migolatus System used to host a significant garrison fleet. Only, Hafner later decided to split it up and send half of the ships to the border."
This was a response to the arrival of the Flagrant Vandals in this territory. Everyone knew that the Verle Task Force sought a way out of the Kingdom. The mech regiment had no reason to linger in Hafner, therefore boosting the defense of the border was a logical decision to make.
Too bad the Flagrant Vandals didn’t always adhere to logic.
Ves raised his own hand. "I have a question. Expert pilots are highly regarded, and young expert candidates are even more important. Captain Foster obviously looks young. This means that if she managed to advance into an expert, she’ll likely have decades ahead to serve in Hafner’s military. Her value exceeds veteran expert pilots that are getting on in their years."
"What is your question, Mr. Larkinson?" Verle interrupted with an impatient tone.
"Killing Captain Foster is like strangling Hafner’s favored child in the crib. They’re bound to go mad at us. Won’t we be dooming ourselves by provoking their retribution?"
A heavy atmosphere descended in the conference room. Ves did not like to play the spoiler, but no one seemed to have the courage to speak out this important concern.
Major Verle seemed prepared for this question, though. He smiled back at Ves. "Your concerns are legitimate, but we already have plans in place. We believe that the panic of our sudden invasion of the Nova Migolatus System will mainly provoke a different reaction. If we can attack one of Hafner’s star systems once, who says we won’t be able to do it again? Hafner will certainly be forced to pull back some of their border patrols. This will outweigh Hafner’s desire to exact revenge."
Ves did not think it would be that simple, but Major Verle left no other opening for him to follow up. Obviously, the mech officer did not wish to entertain too many questions at this time.
"There is more to the Nova Migolatus System than their training camp. There are secondary objectives which we can attempt to complete while we are hunting for Captain Foster. Our preliminary timeframe for this mission is three days."
"That’s too short, sir!"
"It’s tight, but I am confident that we can complete this mission. We really can’t afford to stick around longer than seventy-two hours. Any longer than that, and the nearest reinforcements will be bound to corner us. Don’t think that these reinforcements will be as reluctant as those sent to help out the Detemen System. Time is our most precious resource and our most important constraint."
Three days sounded short because it would take a long time for the fleet to travel all the way from the outer reaches of the star system to the closest planet from the sun. Depending on how hard the Vandals pushed their ships, they could reach it within two days at a minimum. That meant that the Vandals only had less than a single day to hunt down this expert candidate.
Ves looked back at the profile of Captain Foster and shook his head. "What a shame."
The Nova Migolatus System brought little to the Hafner System. Colonized and terraformed rather late, the first planet from the star had only been settled by Hafner because it made economic sense. A whole host of AIs calculated that adding an extra farming planet was cheaper than importing more food elsewhere in the long term.
Some time after Nova Migolatus I shaped into a planet fit for human habitation, Hafner latched on an additional purpose. One continent would remain unsettled. Instead, Hafner would import a variety of dangerous genetically modified alien creatures to run a preserve of some sorts. The propagation and mutation of these creatures would be strictly regulated to provide a sufficient and plentiful challenge to mechs.
In other words, Hafner constructed an entire continent-wide ecosystem for the sole purpose of breeding something to kill for the participants of an elite training camp. And they also did it covertly, covering the continent with expansive trees that reached up to a kilometer in height.
Normally, mechs threw enough weight around that they could flatten an entire forest with ease. However, if a mech charged straight at one of Nova Migolatus I’s massive trees, the one who would lose would be the mech, not the tree.
The expansive tree cover also served as ways to shield the surface of the wild continent from prying eyes. The tree leaves had been genetically modified with various publically available biomods that blocked long-distance communications while interfering with any wide-area scans.
Of course, to prevent themselves from losing all contact, Hafner dug an extensive network of underground cables and communication nodes keyed to their own forces. It would be extremely difficult for an outside force to tap into this well-hidden network. This gave the forces of Hafner the homeground advantage.
Overall, hunting an expert candidate that tried their best to hide on this continent would not be easy. Without any additional intelligence, tracking Captain Relia Foster down in this megajungle was as difficult as finding a needle in a haystack.
The problem was compounded by the fact that aerial mechs wouldn’t be able to do much on the Kamwin continent. The trees were too impenetrable for mechs flying above the forest. With leaves, tree branches and tree trunks interfering with everything, it was impossible for aerial mechs to provide support for their landbound counterparts.
As for letting the aerial mechs fly through the forest, well, that was a very quick way to wreck a lot of expensive machines.
The Flagrant Vandals moved quickly after Verle announced their next assignment.
As the Verle Task Force emerged out of FTL, the entire star system must have hit the panic button. Agents loyal to Peace for Hafner relayed the broad movements around Nova Migolatus I via their own quantum entanglement node. If not for that, they would have to depend on lightspeed observations to determine the decisions the defenders had made, which would certainly be hours out of date.
"The local defenders are making a stand."
Only half of the stations in the command center was manned right now, as nobody expected a fight in the immediate moment. It would take almost two days of solid burning to reach Nova Migolatus I. Only then would the prospect of a battle come into fruition.
"The orbital garrison fleet is going on alert, sir. Transports are lifting up from the planet’s main spaceport. They are loading battle supplies and recalling every crew member on leave!"
"The landbound garrison force is buttoning up as well. Old mechs are being pulled out of storage while their bases are going on full alert. Their capital city is becoming increasingly fortified."
Major Verle took on a pensive expression. "Keep an eye on what is happening at the capital city, but put it on a low priority. Only notify me if they are shuffling supplies or war materiel to the continent of Kamwin."
The Vandals didn’t think much of the garrison forces. Their spaceborn contingent had been neutered when Hafner took half of them to the border. As for their landbound contingent, they prioritized the defense of their capital city.
Even if the landbound garrison mechs shifted over to the Kamwin continent, they would still be outnumbered by the Vandals.
While the Vandals had some targets of opportunity in mind, their main purpose in making landfall on Nova Migolatus I was to strangle an expert baby in her cradle.
Every expert was a valuable asset, especially one that had been indoctrinated from birth in your own culture. Though mercenary expert pilots existed, their loyalty always remained in question, and it was not a good idea for a state to rely too much on human-form weapons of mass destruction that could turn on them in a dime.
Thus, to Hafner, a young and promising expert candidate was much more valuable than ten old expert pilots such as Venerable O’Callahan. There was simply no comparison between the two. Even if O’Callahan was ten years younger, his potential had already been tapped, and there was no prospect for improvement.
As for an expert candidate like Captain Foster, as long as she received the right nurturing, she would be able to experience a period of rapid growth. There was even hope for advancing into an ace pilot, though realistically that almost never happened.
All in all, an expert candidate from your own ranks was like a blank slate which you could fill with whatever you wanted. Any state would salivate at the opportunity to shape their skills and beliefs. It was like designing your own personal superhero.
"And now we’ve arrived to spoil their plans." Ves muttered as he directed a major undertaking.
Ves was surprised as almost everyone else when Verle announced their commission. If no one knew about Training Camp Quistas at Nova Migolatus I, they would have guessed that the Vandals aimed to raid a more important star system.
As it was, Major Verle had not given Ves the courtesy of giving him a heads up. Ves expected the Vandals to raid an industrial system like the Hachew System back in Venidse. Urban combat was a very different beast from jungle warfare, and Ves had been forced to issue new orders to modify their landbound mechs for a safari.
Considering the nature of their commission and the difficulty of finding a lone mech on an entire continent, Ves prioritized the enhancement of as much sensor systems as possible. Improving the eyes and ears of at least five mechs in every mech company would vastly improve the odds of tracking Captain Foster down.
Below this top priority, Ves also recommended the Vandals to pay attention to maintaining communication lines. At least one mech in every mech squad should carry a communications backpack module instead of extra supplies.
"It’s a good thing the Vandals employ the same Modular Fitting Standard for their backpack modules, though it’s a pain in the butt as well."
The Vandals didn’t build the majority of their landbound mechs. Instead, they stole them from the Vesians. This meant that they needed to adhere to Vesian technology standards, which included adopting a foreign MFS as well. Backpack modules produced according to the Bright Republic’s MFS simply didn’t fit on a Vesian mech. It was like trying to squeeze a square plug into a round socket.
Fortunately, the landbound contingent didn’t need to bring too much spare supplies. They needed to complete the hunt in less than a day, so there wouldn’t be any need to bring extra ammunition and energy cells.
"Still, there’s also the local fauna to consider. Those genetically modified monsters are meant to provide a decent challenge against intruding mechs."
This might be a problem, because certain genetic modifications or cybernetic implants could make these creatures more susceptible to outside signals. The worst case scenario would be for the training camp to gather every monster and order them to attack any Vandal mech in a massive horde.
However, these safeguards could easily be subverted by anyone else. If certain spies grasped the right codes, they could turn the creatures against the training camp.
Therefore, Ves mentally ruled out such a possibility being true. "Training Camp Quistas won’t be stupid enough to leave a backdoor for their enemies to exploit. The safest way to rule out subversion is to skip the backdoor entirely."
This was the rule for most critical electronics in this age. That was also why mech pilots controlled their mechs from their cockpits rather than through remote control.
"If the training camp is stupid enough to employ controllable monsters, then the hackers in our task force will have a field day."
With that worry subsided, Ves began to ready the Vandal mechs for period but not too intensive or frequent combat. According to the intelligence packages that Peace for Hafner passed on to the Vandals, the monsters generally gathered in squad-sized groups. This was hard-coded in their DNA. This allowed trainees to experience an even challenge when they grouped up into squads, but also enabled mech companies to bail them out if they fell into a spot of trouble.
For a moment, Ves wanted to laugh to himself. This game preserve came into being on the behest of Hafner, but now it seemed that the Vandals might become the main customers.
Then he remembered something. "Training Camp Quistas is an incubator for elites. It’s meant to push the very best out of peak advanced pilots. With pilots of such skill, regular monsters won’t be able to cut it. Only deadly monsters will do."
Despite this caveat, Ves was confident the Vandals could deal with the situation as long as they traveled in double squads or larger groups. Numbers trumped anything as long as the difference was big enough.
Having sent the necessary orders, Ves sat back and waited for the fleet to arrive in orbit.
Two days passed by without much incident. Vigilant against mines or stealth attacks, the task force constantly maintained a rotation of spaceborn mechs around their ships. Though Hafner did not have a track record of using either means, exceptions always existed, so the Vandals did not let their guard down.
Once the Vandals neared Nova Migolatus I, everyone tensed up for a battle. The big question was what the garrison mechs decided to do. For now, their landbound contingent hunkered down at the capital city, while their spaceborn counterparts seemed to adopt a looser pattern.
The Vandals wanted to mop up the spaceborn garrison quickly, so they didn’t hesitate to approach their outnumbered enemy. The defenders on the other hand clearly didn’t wish to tangle with the Vandals, and boosted away from orbit.
"The enemy garrison fleet is adopting a harassment strategy." The tactical officer stated calmly. "Any defense force that is largely outclassed by the invaders will not be eager to fight a conclusive battle. Instead, they’ve likely received orders to stall and disrupt our operations as best as they can without losing their mechs too quickly."
"They won’t succeed." Verle announced. "We’ve restored a sufficient amount of spaceborn mechs to handle their garrison. A harassment strategy only works if your mechs are faster than the enemy’s. As long as we allocate the bulk of our Inheritors and other light mechs into chasing them down, they won’t be able to escape."
As long as the enemy didn’t throw in other surprises, the Vandals likely didn’t have to worry about anything from space.
The next hours proved this prediction as the attempted harassment fell short of what the defenders expected. The Hafner mechs mostly consisted of medium mechs. They were good in a brawl, but could not be expected to outrace an Inheritor mech.
The only snag in the plan was that the garrison employed second-hand combat carriers with peculiar modifications. Shipwrights stripped a large portion of armor from large and heavy ships and boosted their sublight propulsion. This gave the garrison carriers a hefty boost in speed.
Thus, while the defending mechs weren’t able to outrun pursuit, they could still remain out of reach of the Vandals by hopping in and out of their nimble carriers!
"These stripped-down combat carriers are pissing me off!" Major Verle barked with obvious irritation. "They should have been reclassified as light carriers instead!"
A true light carrier was a civilian-grade starship that was built for capacity rather than protection. In that sense, a combat carrier with most of her armor peeled off could justifiably be called a more durable light carrier, as her structure was still stronger than anything available in the private market.
Ships built for speed and acceleration would always be able to outrun a light mech as long as they received a head-start. Since the defenders already saw the Vandals coming, they had been able to time their optimal starting run down to the exact second.
The Vandal spaceborn contingent never stood a chance of catching up. Unless they resorted to a drastic measure such as overloading their mechs, the chase would never bear any fruit.
The tactical officer tried to console his superior. "Sir, the garrison fleet may be able to dance out of our reach, but destroying them is a secondary objective at best. It’s sufficient for us to drive them away from orbit and turn them into a non-factor to the proceedings on the surface."
Basically, both the garrison fleet and the Vandal mechs chasing after them had been put out of play. This wasn’t necessarily a good thing because an outside variable could overturn the situation in space at any moment, yet the odds of something like that happening was low.
The biggest threat they needed to worry about was reinforcements sent by Hafner from the surrounding star systems. Even if they raced towards the Nova Migolatus System at their earliest, they still needed to spend around two days to traverse from the outer edge of the system to Nova Migolatus I’s orbit.
Even if Hafner sent out the biggest armada of mechs and ships, the Vandals would still be able to take action with two days of lead time.
"The situation in space can basically be ignored by us." Ves explained to Iris. Both of them had taken their customary seats in the command center. "Have we detected any hidden turrets or weapon emplacements?"
Iris had kept an eye on the situation on the surface. "None so far, boss. Hafner hasn’t invested too much in fortifying Nova Migolatus I. The only turrets that our sensors picked up so far are located in and around the capital. As for the Kamwin continent, we can’t say anything for certain. We’ve trained out most powerful orbit-to-surface sensors at the suspected coordinates of Training Camp Quistas, but it’s completely covered in the same tree foliage that obscures the entire continent!"
"What does Peace for Hafner has to say? They still have agents on the inside, right?"
"That’s correct, boss, though the rebel group isn’t willing to expose anything to us. All they are willing to tell us is that they have multiple agents in the training camp, and at least one of them is highly placed. If it isn’t absolutely necessary, this agent won’t expose his true colors."
"The value of this spy must be very significant to Peace for Hafner. Ordinarily, organizations wouldn’t hesitate to sacrifice their pawns if it meant they could take down the enemy queen."
The value of a young expert candidate couldn’t be measured with money! Weighing her value at one-hundred billion sovvies or something wasn’t possible because the utility of an expert pilot was inestimably profound.
While expert pilots were capable of inflicting a massive amount of damage to an enemy force, their true value lay in using them as a deterrence. The mere existence or presence of an expert pilot would already be able to snuff out most tricks directed against Hafner.
"It’s time for the next step of the plan. Begin bombardment!"
Ves already developed an inkling of why the Beggar’s Bounty and the Linever Swan had been tasked with mass producing a lot of artificial meteorites. Now that they orbited over rural planet, these meteorites would finally meet their purpose.
Mechs began to emerge from the hangar bays of the combat carriers. Each of them teamed up to push forth the heavy artificial meteorites. Slowly, over fifty of the massive chunks of randomly-fused alloys emerged from the bowels of the ships.
"Drop them!"
The artificial meteorites received precise pushes that sent it into a precise trajectory. Miniature boosters embedded in the meteorites corrected their paths and kept them on track as their orbit slowly decayed. Each of the meteorites slowly plunged into the atmosphere of Nova Migolatus I.
The main projector displayed a wireframe model of their expected pathing. All of them had been aimed to land at a precise coordinate in the middle of the Kamwin continent!
It was the leaked location of Training Camp Quistas!
The reason why the Vandals dropped so many meteorites was because they needed to go through a lot of sturdy trees. Once they felled enough trees, the meteorites also needed to pound the ground, because the core of the training camp was at least a hundred meters underground!
The artificial meteorites were huge chunks of alloys that heated up enormously while they descended due to friction. Unless they were as blind as a bat, the Vesians on the ground would definitely be able to pick up the incoming meteorites.
"We’ve dropped more than enough meteorites to collapse tunnels deep underground." Major Verle remarked. "Faced with the threat of being buried underground, the camp commander will immediately choose to evacuate the camp he’s responsible for. Even if they have bunkers deep and strong enough to withstand the successive kinetic impacts of over fifty meteorites, they won’t be stupid enough to hole up in a single exposed location."
Because after the apocalyptic bombardment came to an end, the Vandals would immediately make landfall on the site of the annihilated training camp! If some Vesians chose to hold up in a nearby doomsday shelter, then they would certainly be killed or taken captive by the eager Vandals.
The events that played out in front of Ves followed everyone’s predictions. By the time the meteorites crashed through the skyscraper trees, opening a path for the subsequent meteorites to bombard the training camp, there didn’t appear to be anything valuable among the wreckage that Ves could detect from the long-ranged sensors.
A long, oval scar had been dug through the expansive foliage. This opening provided the Vandals that had been sent out immediately after the bombardment a sufficient gap to squeeze in transports.
This time, Major Verle and Captain Rakeshir decided against landing half their combat carriers to the surface. Not only was the highly-disturbed soil a poor landing spot for hefty ships, the surrounding trees made it very difficult for them to lift off in an emergency if the enemy decided to launch an all-out attack on them. It was a better choice to make landfall with more expendable transports, even if these vessels needed to make several trips up and down in order to land all of their available landbound mechs.
The Vandals also sent down some supplies and disposable fortifications to secure their temporary beachhead. The main purpose of the beachhead was to secure their line of retreat and to establish a firm line of communication.
The latter was especially important. The Vandal fleet in orbit needed to stay in touch with the beachhead on the ground. The temporary comm center at the heart of their fortifications would in turn serve as a powerful signal beacon to facilitate communications with group of mechs sent out to hunt their primary objective.
One of the upsides to this operation was that the beachhead needed the presence of several mech designers in case the landbound mechs needed servicing. Besides sending down some random low-ranking mech designers, Ves also sent out Vedette, Mercator and Trozin.
He decided to send down the latter two because he didn’t like them very much. If anything tragic happened down at the surface, at least Ves wouldn’t miss their presence.
As for the choice of sending down a potential protege, Vedette didn’t register too much on his radar yet. Unless his potential bloomed later on, he was strictly expendable. If Vedette happened to meet an unfortunate end, Ves could simply direct his attention to one of his colleagues instead.
Predictably, Vedette immediately demanded a private conversation with Ves. "Sir, why am I assigned to the surface?! That is no place for a mech designer!"
"On the contrary. Being close to the action means you can respond much faster than us. Mech designers shouldn’t be strangers to a little excitement. I don’t hate you, Vedette. In fact, I’m doing you a favor. I hope you can use this opportunity to widen your perspective enrich your ability to design mechs."
No matter how many excuses Vedette weaseled out of his cowardly mouth, Ves resolutely rejected them all. The man had been ordered to shuttle down to the surface and nothing could change his mind.
After packing off the young and inexperienced mech pilot, Ves turned to other matters.
"Has Captain Foster’s whereabouts been confirmed yet?"
"Sir, according to the rebel spies, Captain Foster had already set off into the wildlands a day ago." Iris explained to Ves. "She has a significant head start over our landed forces."
"The good captain will be looking to hide her tracks, though. Fleeing at full speed won’t be an option because she also needs to ration her energy. In addition, a valuable expert candidate won’t travel alone, though she won’t be surrounded by too many mechs. Even a child would be able to follow the tracks in that case."
Everything appeared to go to plan for the Vandals, but Ves suspected that it would not be so simple. They already met some difficulties trying to clean up the spaceborn garrison. As for hunting down an expert candidate, well, the troops on the ground wasn’t chasing after a herbivore.
"A peak advanced mech pilot with a resonance strength of 0.00001 laveres is vastly more dangerous than any other advanced mech pilot. It’s not out of the question for them to defeat five or ten mech pilots by themselves."
Ves read up on expert candidates in the central database after Major Verle first announced the commission. A wealth of documentation described their exact abilities. While none of their attributes exceeded the human norm, some have experienced a rapid growth akin to injecting a handful of gene boost elixirs.
In addition to that, their skills developed in rapid tempo as well, as if the candidates had found themselves in a transition point between an advanced pilot and an expert pilot.
Some mech pilots believed that if some of their skills had improved up to an invisible standard, their minds and bodies would break through the cocoon of their mundane forms and sublimate into an entirely new life phase.
Ves scratched his head when the descriptions become too opaque. Much of the documentation became filled with jargon and incomprehensible theories that only biomedical researchers understood. He didn’t necessarily believe in what little he understood either.
From his own understanding, he guessed that spirituality was actually the central factor in determining whether a mech pilot could reach the expert level.
It would be nice if the Vandals managed to capture Captain Foster alive. Ves would definitely have the opportunity to get close to the captive and probe her with his abnormally strong Spirituality.
"Sir!" Ves raised his hand and gestured to Major Verle. "Are we out to capture our target, or are we only interested in killing her?"
"Ideally, I’m not opposed to capturing her. An expert candidate is prime research material. Her corpse won’t be able to tell us much. If we can apprehend her alive, we can do much to alleviate our difficulties. Though we can’t hope to turn her against us, we can still trade her to the Mech Corps."
The fate of a captive expert pilot was not very pleasant. Brainwashing them was possible, but that was also very much taboo. Once word got out that a state brainwashed a captive expert pilot, their own experts would immediately revolt. The MTA would also send out a rebuke.
All in all, a captive expert was like a poisoned chalice.
Relia Foster grew up in a small town on Carpenter II, a rural planet in an unremarkable corner of the Hafner Duchy. The Carpenter System was nothing special. It lacked the industries that encouraged development.
Everyone who lived on Carpenter II knew their place. They worked in mundane jobs and paid their taxes to a noble House that they never had any hope of approaching.
When she was young, her parents taught her an important lesson.
"Little Relia. Whenever you meet a noble, never look at them in the eyes. Their might and wealth aren’t something you can withstand."
"Because we are commoners?" The little girl asked.
"Because we are weak."
Over time, when Relia entered school, she learned what commoners truly represented. They owed their lives to the nobles and royals that ruled over them. It was not their place to question. They merely needed to obey.
"You are Hafners first, and Vesians second, never forget that!"
Her classes taught her that the Hafner Duchy shouldered the important duty of shielding the Vesia Kingdom against thieves and other bad men across the border. Even though the enemies dressed up in other identities, their true origin was the wicked Reinald Republic.
It was a state without morals. Their rejection of nobles had caused them to descend into anarchy and misery. Billions of people starved while the people at the top feasted with food that could have fed the entire state for a day.
"The depravity of the Reinaldans are only matched by the cruelty of the Roppongans and the zealotry of the Lisvians. Even our mortal enemies on the other side of the Kingdom cannot match the sheer evil that pours out of the Frozen Leaf Alliance."
Her teachers frequently emphasized the evilness of the trio of states across the border by showing the aftermath of their raids. Broken homes, fallen mechs, families torn apart, the Reinaldan pirates did not even let off children like Relia and her classmates!
"Sic semper pirata!"
Relia didn’t know what that meant, but everyone repeated it for some reason, so she mindlessly yelled out the words in unison.
Most of the time, Relia was a precocious child who played whenever her classes ended. Her idyllic days in that small town came to an end when she reached her tenth birthday. Some Hafner men brought her family to a hospital at a nearby city and put her in some big machine.
Having heard about it from others, she knew that the machine tested something funny called genes. It was said that genes were long strips of strings, and if they wound up just the right way, you became a bigshot that other people called a potentate!
Occasionally, some boy or girl from her town would test positive for the right genes. Their entire family had cause to celebrate because Hafner bestowed them lots of money so that the newly-discovered potentate could attend a distant academy, which was like a school for fighting!
Still, this almost never happened, so Relia didn’t think she was anything special.
She was so wrong.
The console in front of the doctor beeped in alarm. After a short analysis, the doctor grinned and whooped.
"What is wrong? Is there something wrong with our child?" Her mother asked with concern.
"Nothing of the sort! Your child is very likely to be a potentate, and not a weak one at that! Further testing is required!"
The excitement uprooted the entire hospital. Doctors and nurses kept prodding at her, taking out samples of blood and saliva. They even cut her brown locks of hair!
For some reason, the hospital couldn’t come to a definite conclusion about the specialness of her genes. Only half a day later, a big and menacing shuttle arrived before the hospital and took away Relia and her parents. Little Relia thought that they would be taken to the capital city of Carpenter System.
She was wrong.
Despite the harsh military lines of the shuttle’s interior, the journey went absolutely smooth, so much so that Relia only found out later that they had been brought into space!
"Wow! I’m actually in space! My friends will be so jealous of me!"
She didn’t know that she would never return to Carpenter II at that time.
As Relia stared out of the porthole of the shuttle, admiring the globe that was her home, the vehicle slowly docked with a larger vessel that turned out to be a corvette. While the Fosters made themselves comfortable in the cramped ship, the corvette zipped to an entirely different star system!
"Wow! We’re actually travelling faster than light! Mom, is light really fast?"
Her mother laughed awkwardly before trying to distract her daughter with some toys.
A few days later, the corvette arrived at a star system that Relia only heard from her teachers. "We’re in the Beicham System!"
The Beicham System was the capital system of the Hafner Duchy! The Duke of Hafner himself resided in a massive palace on Beicham III! When the big men told Relia that she would be brought to a special facility on that same planet, Relia’s eyes began to grow stars! What wonders would she see?
Once the corvette went through a number of security checks, another shuttle brought the Fosters to the surface of Beicham III. The shuttle touched down in an enclosed parking space, whereupon men armed with weapons that Relia had only seen in dramas firmly guided her family inside a massive research facility of some sorts.
The little girl oohed and aahed at every fancy machine in her sights, even though she recognized none of her functions. Their high-tech appearances alone served to ignite her curiosity.
Once deep inside the facility, Relia underwent a more expansive round of testing. The frequent prodding made her feel scared, but her parents were always by her side, so she managed to withheld her cries.
Fortunately, the Hafner doctors didn’t disturb her for too long. They ended their testing after three days of testing and informed their family of some of the results.
"Congratulations Mr. and Mrs. Foster, your daughter is a promising individual!" The senior doctor announced with a smile.
"Is she sick or anything!?"
"Oh, she is as healthy as she could be. Genetically, she’s remarkably perfect! There are Fridaymen who would be envious of her genetics!"
"Then... what is all this about? Why isn’t Relia like the other potentates from our town?"
The doctor took on a serious expression. "Potentates are rare among our population, but they emerge frequently enough for Hafner to treat them according to long-standing policies. However, there are some cases which merit a closer look. Young Relia is exactly such a special case. The preliminary results from the clinic from your rural planet were so astounding that we didn’t hesitate to bring you to the capital of the Hafner Duchy. What our state-of-the-art machines have determined has only verified those amazing results!"
"So is this something good for little Relia?"
"It is more than good!" The senior doctor proclaimed, then turned to Relia with a gentle smile. "Relia Foster, your potential has been tested, and not found wanting at all. From this day onward, you may now bear the status of potentate with pride!"
Relia already thought about the extra allowance the Hafners would pay to the family members of a potentate, but the doctor wasn’t finished.
"It is our pleasure to announce to you an additional blessing! Through rigorous investigation, we have determined that your genetic aptitude has reached one of the most uppermost percentiles of all potentates! In normal parlance, your genetic aptitude falls squarely into A grade!"
A grade genetic aptitude!
Even though the Foster parents didn’t know the full weight of that grade, they knew that little Relia was much more special than they thought!
"Then... will she be attending an academy at Carpenter II?"
"No! Absolutely not! Why would Hafner want to waste uncut gem like Relia? Those hillbilly teachers at your podunk academy won’t be able to bring out more than a tenth of her potential! Ah, forgive my excitement. This is good news for you! Though the paperwork will come later, I can already tell you that Hafner will sponsor your new lives on Beicham III! Your daughter will enter one of the most prestigious mech academies on our capital planet and receive the highest level of tutoring! Come twenty years later, your daughter will definitely become one of Hafner’s heroes!"
From that day onwards, Relia said goodbye to her pleasant and tranquil life on Carpenter II. The Hafner administration whisked the Fosters away to a villa ten times larger than their old home. While her father and mother received easy jobs on the capital planet, Relia was pushed into attending a fancy academy.
All of the changes scared her if she was being honest. She was scared out of her wits when she found out that a lot of noble sons and daughters attended their elite academy!
Fortunately, the Hafner people did their best to welcome her in their midst. After her much more wealthy cadets found out that she possessed an A grade aptitude, her noble cadets bumped away her fellow commoners in the academy and tried to befriend her as much as possible.
It was a wild ride for Relia, though she could always depend on her tutors to set her straight. She only found out later that the Hafners paid a lot of attention to the nurturing of each A grade potentate. In the circle of mech pilots, everyone else were commoners while an A grade potentate like her received treatment akin to a noble!
It was like the galaxy had been turned upside down!
Her time at the academy quickly proved her talent. She breezed through the classes to the point where she mastered the lessons two to four times faster than her fellow cadets! Each time she learned something new, she absorbed the knowledge and skills like a sponge and displayed them with perfect accuracy when she hopped into a training mech!
She quickly distinguished herself at the academy. Besides a handful of other A grade potentates in other year groups, nobody could best her in a fair duel. Relia quickly became accustomed to fighting under handicaps whenever she needed to duel her fellow cadets.
"Your progress is excellent, Cadet Foster."
"I aim to please." She nodded demurely.
Besides learning how to fight, she also learned a lot of etiquette and how to speak words without offending someone important. Just because she was an A grade potentate didn’t mean the Duke of Hafner would stay his hand if she called him a bastard.
"Since you require less time to master your lessons, your supervisor has decided to supplement your lesson plan with officer training."
"Officer training, sir?"
"The moment you graduate, you will immediately become a commissioned officer in the Hafner mech legions. This is a rare privilege that will kickstart your career, so don’t treat this opportunity lightly!"
From then on, Relia not only trained to become a mech pilot, she was also being groomed into a mech officer. Though the former came naturally to her, the latter provided her with much more challenges. Leadership had nothing to do with genetic aptitude, so she needed the learn the ropes the old fashioned way.
If not for the help of her tutors, Relia would have never made it through officer training. As part of her training to become a mech officer, she found herself being challenged to lead her fellow cadets during classes. Since everyone was still young, it was exceptionally hard to get them to adhere to her orders.
The young but growing woman managed somehow. Though some people envied her genetic aptitude and despised her commoner status, the academy teachers made it clear that she was destined for greater things! Knighthood was within her grasp!
Once most cadets knew that she was a knight in the making, they stopped regarding her as a lucky commoner and treated her as if she was already part of the lowest peerage. After passing through this hurdle, Relia smoothly graduated from the junior academy and effortlessly graduated from the advanced academy as well.
The Mech Legion commissioned her as a mech lieutenant when she was fresh out of training.
Though she wanted to spend more time with her parents, the newly christened Lieutenant Foster knew that her family’s privileges could only be sustained by fulfilling her obligations. She followed the arrangements of the Mech Legion and joined a Hafner mech regiment called the Hostland Warriors.
The 7th Hostland Warriors of the 4th Hafner Mech Legion became her new home. After ten years of study, Relia Foster finally found her true calling.
Relia fit particularly well with the Hostland Warriors. While they weren’t particularly elite, their main strength lay in their versatility.
The Warriors adhered to a balanced lineup of spaceborn, aerial and landbound medium mechs. They utilized a dizzying amount of mech models, only some of which had been developed in-house. The responsibility of developing the less important designs had been outsourced to loyal Hafner mech designers operating in the private market.
None of that was important to Relia. The best trait about the Warriors was that they mixed up their mech pilots between different roles and mech types, allowing them to slowly explore their best roles.
Her first few years as a lieutenant served as a honeymoon of sorts. She refined the lessons she learned in real deployments against real enemies. Though her first battle frightened her a bit, her training bit in and she managed to deal through the reality of serving in the armed forces of the Hafner Duchy.
"Mech pilots are trained to kill."
No matter who they fought, the Hostland Warriors always fought on behalf of their homes! To Relia, she fought for the welfare of her family. No matter what, as a dutiful daughter who has received the nurturing of all of Hafner, Relia eagerly wished to repay her debts.
So began her first tour of duty, where she rotated between the vastly different mech companies of the Hostland Warriors. Each mech company possessed their own unique quirks and worked with a different mix of mech models. This allowed Relia to sample different types of mechs and employ them in vastly different circumstances.
From piloting a landbound cannoneer, to intercepting a fleeing pirate in a spaceborn light skirmisher, Relia tried them all. In the end, she returned to her initial choice, and settled on her primary specialty.
"There is nothing better than to wield the sword."
There was a sense of purity in piloting a swordsman mech. Though the lack of shield hampered its defensive capability, from a different perspective it liberated the mech type from getting bogged down. The balance of speed, armor and agility of a medium swordsman mech turned them into exquisite warriors that required a lot of thought and finesse to draw out their potential.
Other mech archetypes did not require too much thinking to put them into use. A knight mech mainly put up their shields to guard their comrades from incoming fire, while a rifleman mech only needed to point the barrel of their guns in the right direction.
Not that Relia still had much to learn when it came to piloting those mech types, but many of her fellow Warriors already had them covered. What she truly craved was a challenge. Piloting a mech came easy to her, perhaps a little too easy for her tastes.
The lack of challenges unsettled her. What she needed was to find the perfect mech type that would slow her down and force her to learn the lessons that she hadn’t been able to receive when she piloted a simpler mech.
The sword looked simple, but it allowed any mech to outplay their opponents. The effectiveness of swordsman mechs against ranged opponents depended on whether they could catch up to them. As for slower mechs and other melee mechs, it was fair game to Relia.
With the right techniques and a deep understanding of her mechs, Relia became a whirlwind of violence against the opponents of the Hostland Warriors. This predominantly meant fighting against Reinaldan pirates.
"Greedy and cowardly scum!"
No matter how hard the Hafner mech legions tried to guard their borders, the Reinaldans always managed to invade their stars! Often times, the Hostland Warriors arrived too late to save a vulnerable shipping convoy or an isolated planet. Each time she witnessed the aftermath of a pirate attack, she became more and more angry.
She stepped up her sword training, learning various styles and techniques from her fellow Warriors. Her mech regiment patrolled a vast stretch of stars and formed roving patrols that allowed their mech pilots to witness different sights. Each new star system opened Relia’s eyes to what Hafner truly consisted of. These were the stars she was duty bound to protect!
Her sense of purpose strengthened with each new sight. She fit in well with the Hostland Warriors too, as her competence won over the skeptics who thought she was a bit too young to be an officer.
Still, nothing was ever certain when piloting mechs. Most of the times, the units Relia was a part of achieved some measure of success. Whether it was smashing apart pirate mechs or chasing them away, the Hostland Warriors always caused the pirates to scatter in fear.
That was until her patrol unit met a large pirate gathering composed of over four spaceborn mech companies.
Compared to the two mech companies that the Hostland Warriors sent out to their location, they were woefully outnumbered!
The pirates smelled blood and immediately moved to gang up on them! Relia fought with vim and fury in her spaceborn swordsman mech. Even as her fellow Warriors fell under the onslaught, she found a fire within herself that allowed her mech to move a little faster and hit a little harder.
"Sic semper pirata!"
This tiny difference meant everything to her, and she started to chop a succession of pirate mechs in rapid tempo. She felled so many pirates that day that she single-handedly drove them off from continuing the fight!
The loss of so many mech pilots devastated the Hostland Warriors, though. Relia didn’t feel as if she achieved a victory. Nevertheless, the Warriors celebrated her prowess, and due to an opportune vacancy, even managed to push her into becoming a captain.
Ever since then, Relia sometimes called back to her amazing back then. Whenever she found herself in a challenging situation, she drew upon some hidden strength and burst out with an amazing level of performance.
For a long time, Relia thought that she was drawing upon feelings of vengeance and righteous retribution.
Yet the Hostland Warriors began to grow suspicious. When they activated all of their sensors in the next big fight, the truth astounded every Warrior, including Relia!
It turned out that she had poked a tiny hole into the barrier that barred her way from becoming something greater!
"Captain Foster, you’re an expert candidate!"
Even though Relia was blessed with A grade genetic aptitude, she had never dared to dream that she would be able to advance into an expert pilot. Every expert was a transcendent figure among them. They were more than human and could even be said to have stepped on the path of godhood!
For all of those scientists to claim that Relia had the potential to join their ranks simply made her silly. How could she be so blessed? Had she saved an entire planet from annihilation in her past life?
When the Warriors offered to sponsor her entry into an elite training camp meant to push promising mech pilots into breaking through the barrier, Relia tentatively accepted this opportunity.
"At my current state, I won’t be able to take revenge against every pirate. Once I become a genuine expert, it will be a different story."
As for her automatic elevation to the noble rank of baron, Relia didn’t care. Mundane trappings ceased to spark her interest, though she faintly thought that she would be able to give her family an even better life.
Training Camp Quistas brought her away from the war against pirates, which she initially hated. What was the use of battling a bunch of giant tigers and other animals when there were pirates out there that needed to be stopped?
Relia quickly learned that the training camp was not as easy as she thought. They developed a rigorous training program that could push the limits of everyone who participated. Even expert candidates like her couldn’t breeze through the program without effort!
"There are so many monsters on this planet!"
From reptiles to mammals to bizarre alien creatures that resembled crystals and living oozes, Relia fought against numerous mech-sized beasts every day. Sometimes she travelled in a squad, but most of the time the training camp had sent her out alone.
Only when she was alone would she face a sufficient challenge.
Due to genetic programming, adult monsters possessed a grouping instinct where they often gathered together in small gatherings. Against a standard mech squad, such a group of monsters could be deadly in the wrong circumstances.
Against a single expert candidate, this group of monsters pressured her like nothing she had experienced before. Even the fight that formed the catalyst to the transformation of her life phase, withstanding an onslaught of monster attacks was supremely challenging for her. These creatures weren’t stupid and utilized rudimentary pack tactics against a lone mech.
Each battle seemed to be a struggle between life and death. She drew out her potential in each and every hard fought battle, of which there was many in her time on the Kamwin continent.
"What does not kill me makes me stronger."
Though she believed that the training camp wouldn’t let her die against a bunch of overgrown beasts, she still experienced a lot of stimulation during her fights. Each time she survived another fight, it became a little easier to enter into that particular state of mind where all of her capabilities received a comprehensive boost.
"It’s taking less and less effort to enter my super mode!"
Relia guessed that once she reached the point where she could sustain her so-called super mode indefinitely, she had successfully advanced to expert pilot!
According to her own judgement, she was five or six months away from that point. Though the threat from the monsters had diminished a little, she still experienced enough harvests to continue this pattern of training.
That was until foreigners invaded the Nova Migolatus System!
"Brighters are coming! The Flagrant Vandals have come to burn down the entire system!"
The Flagrant Vandals had become the entire kingdom’s latest bogeymen. Their daring assault on the Detemen System and their successes in beating back the Calico Dancer Bats and Frosty Meteors had given them a formidable reputation! Vile, greedy and unprincipled, this raiding regiment was nothing different from a pirate gang!
Even as everyone in the training camp panicked, Relia instead relished an opportunity to fight against the famed Vandals.
"You’re in danger, Captain Foster! Word has come that they are specifically here to deal with you!"
The camp commander prioritized the safety of their most promising seed over everything else. Against her judgement, Relia had been ordered to board her mech and run as far away as possible!
It was humiliating, yet orders were orders!
She had witnessed the events that followed after. From the unscrupulous use of artificial meteorites, to the landing of the Vandal landbound forces, Relia witnessed it all through her connection with the underground communication network.
The Vandals proved more competent than Hafner had thought. They somehow sniffed out the right direction of Relia’s retreat, and sent out their fastest in pursuit.
Since Relia piloted a medium swordsman mech, she would never be able to outrun the hounds. In addition, her flight had also been severely hampered by the need to erase all of their traces. If not for that, then her head start would have been more substantial!
Still, the way the Vandals honed in the right direction was suspiciously uncanny. Was there a spy among her escorts?
It didn’t matter. Spy or not, she would use her strength to smash their ambitions!
"Get ready to fight! Sic semper pirata!"
"Sic semper pirata!"
The first skirmish unfolded in a fury. The overeager mech pilots of the scout mechs that hounded her squad couldn’t help but take their first bite. Their skirmishers employed hit-and-run attacks, relying on their excellent mobility to remain out of reach.
"You’re not the only one who can sprint!"
Unfortunately, Relia’s swordsman mech was capable of exerting a large amount of power in very short bursts! The legs of her mechs exploded into action, enabling her to close the distance in rapid tempo. Her mech instantly performed three slashes in succession as it dashed through the ranks of the Vandal mechs.
Three of their mechs instantly collapsed to the ground, each of them bearing fatal sword wounds!
"My sword will run red with Brighter blood! Sic semper pirata!"
Relia piloted a special swordsman mech provided by the Quistas training camp. The Neyvar model excelled in fighting against the creatures. It boasted an even armor coverage that strengthened its weak points at the cost of reducing its frontal armor. That was not a problem for her, because she could easily deal with any beast attacks that came from the front.
The mech further distinguished itself with its strong mechanical power. The augmented artificial musculature combined with a strong engine allowed the Neyvar to burst out with a humongous amount of strength.
The only downside to the mech was that it drained a lot of energy when Relia pushed its capabilities. Training Camp Quistas pointed out her lack of care regarding her energy levels.
Most of her engagements up to now consisted of ambushing pirates. The Hostland Warriors only deployed her unit when the carrier she was on had taken an advantageous position against the pirates.
Working with the Neyvar taught Relia a brutal lesson on how to conserve her energy. Attempting to survive more than a day in the monster-filled forests of the Kamwin continent couldn’t be done unless she rationed her energy.
Though she made good strides this day, all of her concerns about conserving her energy went out the window as soon as pirates tracked her down. She gritted her teeth in fury as she beheld the surviving scum. The cowardly pirate light mechs backed off after she demonstrated her skill with her sword.
Her Neyvar picked up a score of incoming enemy mechs. She couldn’t stay still for long. Between flight or fight, she picked the latter any day.
"We won’t be able to shake these pirates off without a fight! Cover me! For Hafner!"
"For Hafner!" Her escorts repeated over the comm channel.
The Neyvar groaned as Relia put the swordsman mech to its paces. It wielded its long and straight blade in wide, sweeping swings, demolishing a couple more light mechs until the Vandal mechs pulled back out of range.
"Forward!"
Relia entered a heightened state as she pushed her Neyvar onwards. She needed all of the power she could get in order to get rid of this nuisance. She released a guttural growl as her mech gained power and speed. All forms of grace disappeared from its movements as Relia focused on gaining maximum efficiency.
With a mental thought, she diverted extra power to the Neyvar’s legs. This boosted the swordsman mech’s speed, allowing it to spurt forward in a dangerously unbalanced dash. Only her exquisite control allowed the mech to keep its footing.
The Vandals attempted to scatter and wear her down with ranged weapons, but the light ballistic rifles hardly dented the Neyvar’s compressed armor. Training Camp Quistas had been conscientious enough to provide her with an excellent mech.
The Vandal mechs that tried to flee from her reach all stumbled a bit due to the uneven terrain. The kilometer-long trees that towered over the entire Kamwin continent all developed extremely extensive root systems that occasionally penetrated above the soil.
These extraordinarily hardy roots provided mechs with an extra challenge. To the trainees who spent months trekking through the forest, they had already gotten used to the uneven footing. Their mechs also utilized specialized feet that made it easier to travel on uneven terrain.
Unfortunately for the pirates, they entirely lacked these preparations. Several mechs stumbled as they fled as their feet inadvertently dug into roots. They were operating on completely foreign soil compared to Relia.
"You can’t run!"
The Neyvar’s sword pierced the rear armor of the slowest mech. A minute amount of blood dyed the blade as the mech pulled out its sword.
Relia went for the killing move!
"No mercy for pirates!"
The Neyvar expended more and more energy to outsprint the fleeing light mechs. Unlike Relia, the foreign mech pilots couldn’t sustain their speed as well due to the strange terrain that limited their sprinting ability. It was as if they were running through mud!
Relia’s escort mechs struggled to catch up with her as she ran down the squads of Vandal mechs. Each time she reached an enemy mech, the Neyvar only took a single stab or swing to disable the light mechs. The expert candidate showed off her full prowess by unconsciously utilizing the most effective means to defeat each enemy mech in range.
Her eyes had gone red with blood as she hunted the Vandals with rabid fury.
What she didn’t know was that the Vandals had not just run and scattered from her grasp. Instead, covertly lured her into a prepared kill zone where a whole host of Vandal mechs lay in wait.
"Captain Foster! There’s an ambush ahead! Cease pursuit!"
Relia barely registered the warning from her escorts. She had already inferred that enemy mechs lay in waiting around her through interpreting the complex sensor data that had been dumped in her mind. Ordinary mech pilots couldn’t handle so much sensor input at once, but the expert candidate willed herself to endure the strain.
"That’s enough, Captain Foster!" A medium spearman mech that looked a little fancier stepped out from behind a tree trunk. "You’re outnumbered and outmatched! This fight doesn’t need to go on any longer!"
The Neyvar slowed and halted into place. Relia faintly realized that she faced a mech captain. Still, she felt no fear despite the threats arrayed against her. To her, every pirate was a pushover.
Her squad of escorts eventually caught up to her. They spotted the enemy mechs as well and took up defensive positions behind some massive tree trunks.
"Captain! More enemy mechs are inbound from the site of the former training camp! According to the sensor data, the Flagrant Vandals are moving to encircle us!"
The pressure piled up on Relia’s shoulders. Even though she was an expert candidate, she wouldn’t be able to withstand the fury of several mech companies by herself. There was a limit to how much she could defy the odds.
Nonetheless, Relia thought nothing about retreat. "This crisis had already reached a critical point. Running is pointless. I would rather fight and give these pirates a lesson they won’t forget! Are you with me, trainees?!"
"We’re with you, captain!"
The mech pilots that accompanied her all consisted of young elites. All of them assented to Relia’s plan. Surrender was not an option, especially against pirates!
"Attack!"
She uttered no more words than that. Relia could trust her escorts to know what to do. Right now, they were more useful to her alive than dead, so her fellow mech pilots didn’t follow her into battle.
The Neyvar endured an onslaught of enemy fire as it charged forth. This time, Relia didn’t opt to run in a straight line. Since her opponent believed that they had enough numbers to take her down, they stopped trying to run.
Big mistake.
"Astral Swordwind Starwalker Steps!"
Relia utilized her homemade movement technique. The Neyvar became as domineering as the astral wind, blowing in each direction with purpose. She developed her incomplete Astral Swordwind techniques in order to unify the necessary movement and attack moves on land and in space. Thus, the Neyvar’s current movement seemed especially strange.
Most of the Vandals missed their shots. The few hits that impacted the Neyvar came from luck rather than skill. The average Vandal pilot fell far short to Relia in terms of skill. She easily hoodwinked their aim and successfully reached the closest squad of mechs.
This time, she faced a number melee mechs, including a hardly medium knight. Yet Relia didn’t slow down her approach.
"Astral Swordwind Swallow Stab!"
The Neyvar bent over at an angle and put its full weight behind its stab. The tip of its sword amazingly went through a gap in the opposing knight’s defense and pierced its left chest armor! Relia didn’t waste any time and instantly retracted the sword before slashing a light skirmisher that attempted to spring an ambush from the side.
"Redemption Slash!"
"Swallow Stab!"
"Triple Redemption Slash!"
"Execution Chop!"
"Double Redemption Slash!"
Barely twenty seconds after making contact, the Neyvar left a trail of ruined mechs. An entire squad of Vandals was no more! Relia’s opponent didn’t stand a chance! Even worse, at least half of the mech pilots had been killed before they managed to eject!
"Death to pirates!"
Relia barely took a breath and continued her assault. The Vandals meanwhile didn’t expect that one of their squads would last so short against the expert candidate. They fully underestimated the prowess of an advanced pilot with one foot in the realm of experts!
As the Neyvar crashed into another squad of Vandal mechs, Relia put her Astral Swordwind techniques to full display. A violent orchestra of speed and power tore through the foreign-operated mechs. Despite resembling popular Vesian mech models, the enemy mechs appeared completely tainted in her eyes. Only slaughter would cleanse the sins of these mechs!
"Redemption Slash!"
"Starwalker Steps!"
There was barely any obfuscation in her moves. Relia disdained the use of feints and forms of misdirection. However, her seemingly simple movements belied her strong foundations and the inherent grace behind her strength. Her Neyvar danced to her palm as it evaded through volleys of incoming laser beams and projectiles.
With each mech she felled, Relia became more and more aware of the flaws to her piloting skills. She had fought against too many monsters lately and had gotten used to their instinctual fighting style.
Battling against human opponents was much more difficult than she thought!
The Vandals surrounded the Neyvar and her escorts in a horseshoe-like formation. No matter where Relia fought, she always needed to be aware of mechs approaching from behind.
While she was able to resolve most of the attacks from the rear, sometimes she simply couldn’t do anything but endure the battering. In this situation, her escorts had no choice but to step in. They diverted over a third of the Vandal mechs sent to deal with her with great difficulty.
Their choice did not come without a price.
"Pritchard!" She yelled in pain as her mech sensed the collapse of a friendly mech.
The other participants of the training camp may have been some of the best that Hafner had to offer, but they all lacked the heaven-defying capability of an expert candidate like Relia.
Two more mechs fell in quick succession, causing Relia to falter in her aggression. "Moseley! Veronique!"
Soon enough, her entire escort squad had been felled. The Vandals had not been merciful to the Hafner mechs, opting to go for the killing blow in revenge against Relia’s deliberate cockpit targeting.
Relia did not even think about who was to blame. All she thought was that she lost all of her new friends. They had trained together and fought together for several months. She remembered each and everyone of their faces.
The Vandals thought that Relia had given up once she realized she was the lone Hafner mech pilot standing.
They were wrong.
"You murderers." She wheezed out as she beheld the mechs that surrounded her. Another mech company had caught up and cut off her escape route. "ALL OF YOU MUST DIE!"
An invisible explosion emanated from the Neyvar, causing the Vandals to be taken aback. Relia didn’t waste the opportunity and moved her mech into attack. Like a furious tiger, the Neyvar sprang towards the Vandal mechs and slashed them down one by one in quick succession.
As the Vandals spread out from the Neyvar, the Hafner mech pushed against its limits and outright broke its speed limit as it dove into another squad of enemy mechs.
The Vandals didn’t stand a chance up close!
Mech pilots started to eject by the dozens as the Neyvar performed far above its nominal performance. Within a span of five minutes, the Neyvar slaughtered over fifty mechs with no signs of rest! The Neyvar radiated a lot of heat, causing the air around the overstressed swordsman mech to distort.
"DEATH!" Relia screamed into an open channel as she chased down the Vandals that desperately wanted to widen the distance.
The hunters had become the hunted!
High above the sky, the ships of the Verle Task Force intermittently witnessed the footage of the astounding events that happened deep within the forest. Ves had to rub his eyes as he stared at the sensor data of a specific measuring instrument.
This particular tool measured the resonance strength of a mech pilot. Currently, the readout had spiked to 1.67 laveres! This was far beyond the bounds of 0.00001 laveres that an expert candidate typically exhibited!
"Sir!" Ves called out to Major Verle. "Captain Foster has broken through her bottleneck! The Neyvar mech that she’s piloting is currently exhibiting forced resonance!"
No one was able to keep calm when they heard that announcement. Even Major Verle lost his composure for a moment.
Captain Relia Foster was a candidate no longer! The difference between an expert candidate and a bona fide expert pilot was not as simple as an amplification of resonance strength.
A true expert pilot was like a demigod, whose attributes and skills received a large promotion. More importantly, an expert that had recently broken through still enjoyed the baptism of breaking through their shackles!
Their life phase was in flux and the power they commanded could be stretched. What this basically meant was that they could draw on a lot more strength than usual!
The Neyvar glowed as an indistinct energy field surrounded it. The entire mech resonated with Captain Foster despite lacking any resonating elements in its design!
This was an obvious display of forced resonance, where an expert pilot achieved the impossible and resonated with a normal mech!
An ordinary expert pilot wasn’t capable of performing such a feat. In fact, forced resonance was one of the signature abilities of an ace pilot. The only reason why Captain Foster could accomplish this feat was because her recent breakthrough left her piloting abilities in flux.
"Sir, Captain Foster is still riding the aftermath of her breakthrough! This is the worst time to be fighting her! I highly suggest you pull back our forces from the chopping board!" Ves advised. "Think through this! Captain Foster may have become an expert, but she doesn’t have the right tools to take advantage of her new state! Right now, she’s obviously pushing her Neyvar mech beyond its limits. That mech won’t be able to take much more abuse, and will certainly be in much worse shape once it cools down! Its energy reserves are rapidly depleting as well!"
Major Verle eventually woke up. "You’re right, Mr. Larkinson."
He ordered an immediate retreat. Unfortunately, due to the spotty communication environment on the Kamwin continent, his orders hadn’t reached the Vandals on the ground in time.
Almost a hundred Vandal mechs lay ruined on the ground. All of the Vandal wrecks bore deep and penetrating sword wounds. The only activity left in the vicinity came from the Neyvar, which hunted down the cockpits that had ejected from the Vandal mechs in time.
"No quarter to pirates!"
Ten minutes passed by until Relia gave up on hunting down the elusive pirates. As the battle rage faded from her mind, she fell out of her super mode and slumped down from her cockpit seat.
"Damnit!"
She defeated so many pirate mechs, but had been unable to bring her comrades back to life. For a moment, she felt as if all of this struggle was pointless, but then she stared at the broken Vandal mechs and regained her resolve.
"As long as pirates still run amok, my duty has not yet ended."
She regained her clarity and scanned the environment for threats. Spotting none in the immediate area, she glanced at the status screens of the Neyvar and winced.
"Sorry old partner, I pushed you way too hard."
The Neyvar had been designed to accommodate mortal mech pilots. It couldn’t withstand the level of performance that an expert pilot demanded from their machines.
The temporary boost in performance from Relia’s display of forced resonance may have turned the Neyvar into a genocide machine, but she was unable to turn water into wine. The material composition of a mech remained the same whether it was piloted by a normal mech pilot or the best expert pilot in the galactic rim.
While the Neyvar definitely needed to be scrapped, Relia tentatively judged that the swordsman mech could still last a couple more days if she didn’t put too much strain on its systems.
This was enough. Relia still thirsted for blood.
"I need to replenish the Neyvar’s energy cells."
The short burst of hyperactive combat left the mech with a much-diminished energy reserve. Thirty minutes more, and the Neyvar would have collapsed despite her best efforts.
Though it saddened her to do so, Relia forced her damaged mech to trudge over to the wrecks of her escort mechs. She picked a medium mech and turned it over to its belly before prying open its lower back armor plating. Carefully, the Neyvar’s delicate movements opened up the fallen mech’s back, revealing several banks of energy cells.
Relia activated a special command, causing the Neyvar to open up its back armor on its own accord and eject the fully depleted energy cells. After that, she quickly manipulated her mech with utmost concentration. The Neyvar carefully removed the energy cells from the fallen mech and slowly inserted it into an open slot at the rear of the swordsman mech.
Almost no mech pilot dared to replenish their energy cells by themselves. Lots could go wrong, and mechs generally weren’t precise enough to handle energy cells without denting them in some way.
These concerns didn’t apply to expert pilots like Relia. Her control over her mech had vastly improved. Precision work like this was child’s play to mech pilots at her level.
The biggest threat she faced besides the Vandals came from the Kamwin continent itself. The Vandals had largely been able to mop up the native genetically modified monsters through sheer numbers, but Relia needed to keep her eyes peeled for any ambushes.
Fortunately, the scale of the fighting had scared away all of the monsters in the vicinity. They still possessed some sense of self-preservation despite all of the genetic modification.
As Relia became accustomed to the chore of swapping energy cells, the Neyvar moved faster and faster until it filled its tank. Though the fallen mech’s energy cells already expended some of its energy beforehand, the Neyvar’s energy levels had risen to seventy percent, enough to sustain it for another big fight.
The Neyvar rose to its feet and powered up its sensors. "Where are you, pirates?!"
Back at the Shield of Hispania’s command center, everyone still needed time to register the disaster they provoked on their own accord. Nobody expected that Relia would break through her shackles so quickly and prove to the Vandals why expert pilots were regarded as demigods.
"I guess we’ll have to start calling her Venerable Foster from now on." Ves muttered to himself. "Her performance after her break through is wildly out of bounds from our most pessimistic projections."
Ves had fallen into the expectations of others, and never really considered whether Captain Foster spontaneously broke through during battle. When it came to expert pilots, his understanding still contained a lot of gaps.
"This isn’t anyone’s fault." Major Verle spoke after a long moment of reflection. "The responsibility for the deaths of our comrades on the ground lies squarely at Venerable Foster’s feet. The only way to absolve ourselves from this setback is to finish the mission and subdue our primary objective. Her advancement to expert pilot just turned her into a bigger priority."
Venerable Foster was worth a lot more than Captain Foster, that was for certain. Peace for Hafner would have to cough up a lot more compensation to the Vandals if they managed to take care of the wild and unstable expert pilot. Ves wondered if the rebel group would make up for their losses. The Vandals had already bled a lot of mechs and mech pilots from this battle.
"Sir! Venerable Foster is on the move!"
"In which direction is she escaping towards?"
"She’s not moving away from our forces! The Venerable’s mech is moving towards our landing site!"
Nobody knew what to think about this decision. Venerable Foster was obviously out for blood. If she knew that the Vandals could only linger in this system for a very short time, she would have been better off running away. By turning around and forcing a fight with the Vandals, she had cut off all hope for escape.
This was good news for the Vandals since they wouldn’t have to worry about running out of time. The only downside was that they needed to face fully-fledged expert pilot in battle. Even if Foster lacked a tailored expert mech, she had already shown what she could do with a Neyvar mech.
Another factor that may have encouraged the expert pilot to turn around was that running away meant bumping into other monsters. While Foster would be able to take them out without too much effort, each encounter would inevitably slow her down and deplete her precious energy.
On the other hand, backtracking the path that had recently been trod by over a hundred Vandal mechs meant a smooth journey. The monster mechs in the vicinity had all been cleaned up, and it would take time for other groups of monsters to take over these lands.
"Your analysis, Mr. Larkinson?"
Ves cleared his throat against Major Verle’s prompt. "If Venerable Foster wishes to force another battle against us, sustaining further casualties is unavoidable. That said, her approach will allow us to make ample preparations."
"I doubt she’s stupid enough to approach us head-on." The tactical officer said. "She might have gone berserk after being cornered in the previous fight, but she’ll be fighting with a cooler head next time. Don’t forget that she’s a qualified mech captain."
"Then do you think we don’t have what it takes to defeat the Venerable?"
"That is not what I said, Mr. Larkinson. We all have to remember that she is all by herself. In addition, her Neyvar mech isn’t able to catch up to her level of performance. These limitations will be vital in defeating her without sustaining too many casualties."
Ves agreed with those points. "According to theory, her previous display of forced resonance is also a one-off phenomenon. Now that her life phase has stabilized, she won’t be able to pull more power from nowhere. She is like a knight with no armor. Without the right equipment, her threat is vastly reduced. We won’t be facing a monster on the level of Venerable O’Callahan."
The other Venerable piloted a mech worth billions of credits, while Venerable Foster had to make ends meet with a damaged mech worth sixty million sovvies at most. This fundamental gap in mech quality couldn’t be overcome by a newly ascended demigod.
"She won’t be alone either." The tactical officer added. "Don’t forget that the Kamwin continent is Hafner’s home ground. Training Camp Quistas initially scattered all of their trainees and instructors because they bet that Foster would have been able to stay out of reach. Now that she is turning around, they are bound by duty to assist."
"How many mechs are we talking about?"
"According to the intelligence provided by Peace for Hafner, the training camp hosted over twenty instructors and around a hundred trainees. All of them are highly skilled, but their mechs are optimized against monsters."
The Vandals already defeated a handful of trainees, so the total number of enemy mechs would still be manageable. Still, they couldn’t underestimate how much damage an expert pilot could do when backed up by over a hundred mechs.
The Vandal landbound contingent wasn’t in the best shape after that disaster of a battle. Ves silently counted how many mechs still retained enough battle capability to resist the enemy and came up with around two-hundred-and-fifty mechs.
"Will this be enough?"
The invasion of Nova Migolatus I by the Flagrant Vandals had taken a very unexpected turn. The Verle Task Force expected to stomp through the jungle and strangle a baby in her crib. They never imagined that the baby would grow up all of a sudden and turn into a dinosaur.
By definition, an expert candidate could always break through to the next rank. Yet most of the times the expert candidate had to accumulate up to that point. This was why Venerable Foster’s sudden advancement came as a surprise. She practically leapt through several stages at once!
"This is going to be another hard-fought battle." Ves thought as he watched on as the Vandals prepared for the worst.
Already, the sensors that the Vandals had placed around their beachhead detected the approach of large groups of Hafner mechs.
They had initially spread out in every direction in order to confuse the Vandals, but ever since Venerable Foster revealed herself, they changed gears and grouped up in one massive formation. With veteran instructors rallying promising young mech pilots, even without an expert pilot at the helm the group had become very formidable.
Naturally, the Flagrant Vandals didn’t shy away from a fight. They possessed their own pride, and after repeated beatings from the hands of different Vesian mech regiments, the Vandals eagerly wished to redeem themselves in battle.
"How manipulative." Ves remarked as he recognized Major Verle’s influence in action. "If I haven’t been watching out for his effect, I might have been caught up in this rising tide as well."
He had gained a greater understanding of Major Verle’s methodology. The man utilized various channels to promote a standpoint. From broadcasting announcements to spreading rumors from chosen agents among the lower ranks, the mech officer always managed to succeed in getting the Vandals agree to every major motion.
If Major Verle hadn’t intervened at this point, the Vandals would have lost heart against an expert pilot. The strength and dignity of a demigod was not something which mortals could withstand!
Every average mech pilot would blanch at the thought of fighting an expert pilot directly. Even if Venerable Foster lacked an appropriate mech, it would be trivial for her to defeat twenty or so mechs at once with a single mech. Ves found it difficult to estimate the damage the superhuman might of an expert pilot could inflict.
Still, she wouldn’t be able to defeat a hundred mechs by herself. The Vandals would have already evacuated Nova Migolatus I if that were the case!
"The Hafner mechs are coming!"
The enemy took their time. Likely, some of the instructors realized that time was on their side. After they converged with each other, they made no moves to attack or retreat until some Vandal scouts harassed them from a distance.
The longer the Hafner mech stayed in place, the more harassment they encountered. The added pressure was meant to move the Hafner mechs into action. They couldn’t retreat, because the Vandal mechs would continue to harass them from behind.
Every other option led to a slow defeat. The training camp participants couldn’t remain passive in the face of enemy harassment.
Vandals obviously favored long, drawn out fights where their superior numbers and abundant supplies could tide them over. The group of Hafner mechs on the other hand were all alone and lost their base. The only choice remaining for them was to force an immediate confrontation.
The Hafner mechs came into visual range with the Neyvar in the lead. After a tense moment of silence, the lead mech opened up a broadcast.
"Flagrant Vandals. You have one chance. Go back to orbit and leave this star system immediately. If not, I will hunt you down and avenge my fallen comrades!"
None of the Vandals responded. Verle looked tempted to patch into the temporary base’s speakers, but refrained from doing so. The prestige of an expert pilot was dreadful, and engaging in a direct conversation with one might ruin his men’s morale.
Instead, he issued out a single command. "Open fire!"
Every ranged mech started to fire at the Neyvar. The swordsman mech reacted quickly and pulled back behind a massive tree trunk before it got hit!
The second battle had commenced!
The ample amount of trees provided both sides with an ample amount of cover. Though the Vandals surrounded their base with prefab walls, they mainly relied on the hardy tree trunks to shield their mechs from enemy fire.
Compared to the Hafner training mechs, the Vandals disgorged a lot more firepower at the enemy. Not only did they field more mechs, they also didn’t have to worry about running out of energy or ammunition.
Ves observed the happenings from the command center of the Shield of Hispania orbiting high above. Since the battle took place at the oval scar, the beachhead was able to transmit a direct signal to the Vandal fleet.
This was the benefit of a higher position! As head designer, Ves possessed the authority to send out other mech designers on site. So far, Mercator, Trozin and Vedette had done a decent job in servicing the mechs on the ground.
Since their lives were at stake, the three mech designers hadn’t slacked off at all. Ves had nothing to complain about their work ethic, though they hadn’t been very helpful when it came to identifying the weak points of the enemy mechs.
Ves had to do that for them. After the first battle, he spent an entire hour going through the footage of the Neyvar. He tentatively identified five major weak points that the Vandals could take advantage of in the next battle.
Right now, the Hafner mechs fell into a weak trend. They hadn’t managed to fell a single Vandal mech. Conversely, the Vandals failed to inflict more than a couple of scratches on the Hafner mechs.
"They’re stalling, sir!" The tactical officer exclaimed. "Compare the firing rates of both sides! The Hafner mechs are conserving their ammunition while dragging out the battle!"
Now that he mentioned it, Ves noticed that the Hafner mechs largely kept themselves behind cover. The massive and highly durable tree trunks absorbed most of the firepower being outputted by the Vandals!
This proved once again that while the Hafner mechs couldn’t run away, they weren’t too eager to confront the Vandals either. They played it smart and focused on conserving their strength.
Right now, the ball was in the Vandals’ court.
"This looks kind of fishy." Major Verle stated. He turned to the sensor officer. "Are there any anomalies on the plot?"
"None detected so far, sir."
"What about the monsters?"
"They are showing no signs of.. no wait, they are massing together into a horde!"
According to the sensor plot, every monster pack began to congregate into a roving horde that was slowly moving towards the beachhead. They had already gathered more than a hundred monsters so far, but their count constantly grew.
The only relief to them was that the monsters moved rather slow!
"At their current pace, the monster horde will arrive in roughly fifty minutes!"
Hafner implemented a backdoor in their genetic programming after all.
"Hackers, get to work."
"Yes, sir!"
Ves did not expect too much from the hackers in the short term. Those monsters would overrun the beachhead long before the hackers managed to figure out a way to override Hafner’s controls.
"Our position is untenable if we let the Hafner mechs run out the clock. Begin with the second phase!"
The Vandals gave up on trading potshots at each other. The abundant amount of cover in the forest prevented them from gaining any advantages in a firefight. They needed to take this battle up close and personal.
The Vandals broke up into squads and mech companies and moved out of the base. Taking advantage of their numbers, their mech companies spread out in different directions and unleashed a fusilade against the Hafner mechs from different angles.
The Hafner mechs faced a crossfire if they remained in place! They quickly pulled back from their battered tree trunks and swung around to attack a single flank of the approaching Vandals.
"They’re aiming to run through our flank!"
The Vandals outnumbered the Hafners but it wasn’t easy to encircle them. The Hafners chose to take the bull by the horns and chose to take the offensive rather than to let the Vandals complete the encirclement. With the Neyvar at the head, the Hafner mechs charged into the Vandal mechs without compunction!
Mechs collided as both sides clashed against each other! The flanking Vandal mechs had quickly adjusted their formation and greeted the incoming Hafner mechs with expectation.
For a moment, Ves found it difficult to distinguish what went on. Throughout the chaos, Ves finally managed to pin down the Neyvar.
A Vandal mech captain and a handful of chosen surrounded the swordsman mech in an attempt to contain it! For now, the Neyvar fell into a passive position as it desperately tried to fend off attacks from every direction.
The only problem was that the Neyvar was weaker than expected! Had the mech sustained more damage than projected?
"Sir the Neyvar is a decoy! Venerable Foster is piloting another mech!"
Damnit! Now that he thought about it, the Neyvar demonstrated none of Venerable Foster’s distinctive sword style. Right now, it only performed the basic moves as it defended itself against multiple Vandal mechs.
"Where is she?!"
Just then, another Hafner swordsman mech exploded into action. This bog-standard copy of an average mech model called the Mackey Craic dropped its camouflage and displayed skill akin to a sword demon! It chopped up three nearby melee mechs in quick succession and helped the Hafner mechs punch through the Vandal line!
"That Mackey Craic is piloted by Venerable Foster!" Ves declared with alarm. "It’s a completely fresh and undamaged mech!"
Though its overall specs fell short compared to the Neyvar, its pristine state meant that Foster didn’t have to worry about her machine breaking down mid-battle!
Right now, the Mackey Craic obviously began to strain against the stress that Venerable Foster was forcing upon its frame. The mech moved faster to accommodate her violent Astral Swordwind techniques. Each attack finished off a Vandal mech with a single move at the cost of wearing down the Mackey Craic!
"For Hafner!"
"Death to pirates!"
"Victory to the righteous!"
The Hafner mechs gained inspiration from their Venerable’s performance. Their morale surged enormously as the Mackey Craic ran through the Vandal mechs like a hot knife through butter. Its killing spree only came to a halt when two Vandal mech captains confronted it before it could break the Vandals.
In addition, other Vandal elements had caught up by now and pressured the Hafner mechs from their rear. The battle instantly swung in favor of the Vandals. The Hafner mechs hadn’t managed to break through in time!
"Curs! Get out of my way!"
The Mackey Craic roundly outplayed the two mech captains and took out their mechs with superior skill! She resumed carving up her opponents, causing the Vandal mech pilots within her sight to shy away. They began to lose heart!
"Sir, our mech pilots at the flank are breaking! The Hafner mechs are breaking through"
"Hold the line, goddammit!" Verle yelled into the command channel. "The Hafner mechs are being hammered from the rear! We can finish them off if we can hold them in place!"
Unfortunately, though the battle went well at the rear of the Hafner formation, the front was a very different matter. The specter of Venerable Foster frightened the nearby Vandals into running away. None of them stood a chance against an expert pilot!
With every Vandal mech at the front trying to widen the distance, the Hafner mechs succeeded in removing themselves from the clash. They lost a lot of mechs during the brief engagement, but they succeeded in bleeding the Vandals as well. Venerable Foster was responsible for downing most of the Vandal mechs!
"The monster horde is approaching the beachhead!"
The Vandals needed to finish the battle quickly!
The monster horde threatened the Hafner mechs as well as the Vandals. Ves did not believe that the Hafners had implemented too many controls in the genetically modified monsters. Ordering them to group up and sweep through every mech on the Kamwin continent was a double-edged sword. Short from ordering them to disperse their horde, the Hafner mech pilots might not make it through the monster wave alive unless they possessed another failsafe.
The Vandals couldn’t let their opponents pull out another trick. They needed to end this battle quickly or at least take care of their primary objective.
After the Hafner mechs punched through one of the Vandal wings, they attempted to widen the distance.
The other Vandals attempted to catch up to them, but they were being hindered by their own comrades! The Vandals who witnessed Venerable Foster’s prowess in battle completely lost their will to fight, and became nothing more than obstacles to their fellow teammates! The wrecks that littered the ground also served as an impediment to the pursuers.
The Vandals needed time to reorganize their ranks. They had no choice but to let the Hafner mechs go.
However, before the Hafner mechs successfully disengaged, a furious barrage of cannon fire impacted their formation! Dozens of heavy projectiles and powerful laser beams pelted them from the side!
Over twenty Akkara heavy mechs had been transferred to the surface! Ordinarily, they served as makeshift turrets for the Vandal combat carriers. Major Verle had made a judgement call and opted to field the Akkara mechs on the ground at the cost of weakening the defenses of the fleet.
As long as Hafner didn’t attack the Vandal ships in orbit, the risk was worth it!
The Flagrant Vandals didn’t particularly excel at ranged combat. The only mech model that performed well at range was their Akkara heavy cannoneers. These slow and heavy quadruped mechs provided a stable platform for the numerous cannon barrels mounted on its frame. An entire company of Vandal melee mechs guarded the valuable Akkaras.
Gathering over twenty heavy mechs and ordering them to fire in a single direction was a lethal move. The Hafner mechs hastily ran for the nearest cover, but not without losing over twenty mechs!
Along with the losses sustained in the earlier clash, the Hafner mechs only numbered around fifty mechs!
"This is the best way to beat an expert pilot." Ves concluded. "Captain Foster is deadly up close, but even she has to lower her head when it comes to massed firepower."
The heavy caliber of the cannons mounted on the Akkaras meant that her thoroughly average Mackey Craic mech couldn’t shrug off the shells and laser beams without concern. Already the swordsman mech had gained several ugly cracks and scorch marks upon its armor!
The Akkara mechs continued to unleash death even after the Hafner mechs dove for cover. The heavy shells and laser beams worked away at the tree trunks. While the massive trees were capable of withstanding regular mech fire, the massed firepower of over twenty Akkara mechs was in an entirely different class!
The Hafner mechs lost too many comrades. Their plan was already a longshot, but to come across an unexpected setback depressed the surviving Hafner mech pilots.
However, they never thought about surrender. A warrior of Hafner never relented against pirates!
"The monster horde we’ve instigated should be close!" An instructor said. "We only need to endure for ten more minutes until the monster horde arrives!"
Both sides gritted their teeth as they fought with their utmost. By now, the main thrust of the Vandals finished sorting out their battle lines. They pressed on towards the suppressed Hafner mechs. Even after they sustained some losses, they still outnumbered the Hafner mechs by at least three-to-one.
The power of the Akkara mechs was in full display right now! Though Ves often complained in his mind about their cost and troublesome maintenance issues, he couldn’t help but celebrate their inspiring performance!
"If Venerable Foster piloted a true expert swordsman mech, then she would have been able to dash up close and slice and dice these clumsy heavy mechs." Iris said besides Ves. "It’s tragic that she never got the opportunity to show off her expert abilities in a better machine."
Ves huffed in response. "If she hadn’t broken through in a completely spontaneous moment, then we wouldn’t have to drag this battle out."
"Sir, the monster horde is five minutes away!"
Major Verle already looked pensive at the worsening situation. Though the Akkara mechs did a good job keeping the Hafner mechs from pulling something off, they weren’t able to finish them off.
"Divert the Akkara group and half of our main group to deal with the monster horde."
In any case, the Hafner mechs only numbered a bit more than forty mechs by now. The Vandals didn’t need to allocate all of their landbound forces into finishing them off.
The battle lines shifted. Half of the Vandal mechs eagerly split off in order to confront the incoming monster horde without distraction. The Akkara mechs along with their escorts also moved away from the Hafner mechs.
By now, the monsters numbered over five-hundred mech-sized beasts. That was sufficient to trample Training Camp Quistas even if they hadn’t suffered from a massive bombardment.
Diverting around a hundred-and-fifty mechs was overkill to Ves, but Major Verle and the mech captains on the ground wanted to finish off the monsters quickly before they attracted more beasts. With the collective firepower of the Akkara mechs, the Vandals wouldn’t have any problems with massacring the monsters.
This left just a bit over a hundred Vandal mechs to confront the remnants of Hafner. Though forty mechs still remained standing, none of their mechs had made it out unscathed. Seeing that the Vandals diverted much of their mechs elsewhere, Venerable Foster saw an opportunity to disengage.
"Retreat!"
Without the Akkara mechs suppressing their freedom of movement, the Hafner mechs emerged from behind the trees and retreated at an orderly speed.
The Vandals that remained followed in pursuit. Their ranged mechs fired their weapons as they ran, hoping to chip away at the fleeing Hafner mechs.
The Hafner mechs reciprocated. All of their mechs possessed the capacity to rotate their torsos by at least a hundred-and-sixty degrees. This gave their rifles enough of an angle to fire right behind them, though their mech pilots struggled to keep their mechs on their feet.
Both sides retained some scruples against each other.
If the Vandals split up into different elements again, they would only make themselves more vulnerable against Venerable Foster. This prevented the Vandals from splitting off their light mechs in an attempt to flank or surround the Hafner mechs.
Venerable Foster on the other hand felt constrained by her opponent’s stubborn insistence on sticking together. Their close formation and lack of diversions meant that Foster would have to challenge all hundred Vandal mechs at once if she decided to take the offensive.
She calculated the outcome of the battle between the monster horde and the Vandal mechs. Due to the meteorite bombardment, most of the sensors and communication lines buried in the vicinity had been cut off. She found it difficult to estimate how long the monsters could keep the defending Vandal mechs in place.
"With those heavy mechs lending their assistance, those stupid beasts won’t last very long. I doubt they can hold out for an hour."
She needed to finish off the pursuing Vandals before that time!
"We need to turn around and attack!"
Her prestige swayed the Hafner mech pilots without much convincing. She didn’t even need to provide an explanation for her to direct her fellow comrades.
They turned around abruptly and closed in on the pursuing Vandal mechs. Both sides predominantly retained their melee mechs, so the battle quickly devolved into a confusing melee.
Two different mech captains confronted the Mackey Craic with varying levels of confidence. Though they couldn’t match the speed and power displayed Venerable Foster, they possessed enough experience to preserve their mechs and their lives.
The expert pilot quickly grunted in frustration as her opponents stopped her from massacring the rank-and-file.
Although the mech pilots of the Flagrant Vandals were not as competent as proper mech pilots of the Mech Corps, their mech captains represented the best of their best. None of them were slouches when it came to piloting skill! Both mech captains happened to be elevated to their ranks due to their praiseworthy skill. While they weren’t able to command all that well, their piloting prowess was enough to suppress their subordinates!
Right now, they utilized every drop of their skill to survive the Mackey Craic’s onslaught of techniques! If a human made the same moves as the Mackey Craic, they would have strained their muscles or snapped their bones. Foster’s sword style could only be performed by a specific class of flexible swordsman mechs!
Utilizing the inhuman range of motion of mechs and combining it with the weight of a mech, Venerable Foster attacks came fast and heavy. If not for wielding a highly reinforced mech-sized sword meant for slaying hardy monsters, the Mackey Craic would have long cracked its only weapon!
Each sword strike pushed the defending Vandal mechs back. One of the mech captains piloted a knight mech. Its shield began to split from all of the abuse. The other mech captain piloted a spearman mech, which tried and largely failed to keep the Mackey Craic out of reach.
Under the control of Venerable Foster, the Mackey Craic moved with precision. The mech always managed to avoid a stab and spin close in order to sweep the spearman mech. After several failed attempts at stabbing the Mackey Craic, the mech captain finally made a misstep!
The Mackey Craic battered the spear to the side with an arm and hacked its sword with the other arm! Though the hasty move didn’t have too much power behind it, the sword somehow managed to hit a critical junction in the spearman mech’s arm!
"No!"
The Vandal knight mech moved to shield its comrade, but the Mackey Craic already recovered from its first attack and launched a second attack. Its sword stabbed straight at the chest of the spearman mech!
Just moments before the sword touched against the battered chest armor of the Vandal mech, its cockpit suddenly ejected from the rear! A scattering of rear armor plating bloomed out of the spearman mech’s back as the cockpit safely flew out of sight while barely managing to dodge the trees in its way.
The survival rate of a season mech officer was much higher than a rookie because they could always judge the right time to eject!
However, the loss of the spearman mech meant that the remaining mech captain lost a vital pillar of support. Venerable Foster growled in anger as the opportunity to kill a pirate captain slipped.
She quickly turned to vent her fury against the other mech captain. With her skills, it didn’t take more than five seconds to finish off the knight mech. The mech captain didn’t hesitate to eject once he fell in a hopeless situation.
She won!
However, once she glanced at the state of her comrades, she discovered that they quickly fell in numbers! Only twenty Hafner mechs remained standing, and their numbers diminished in rapid tempo!
"Foul Vandals!"
The Vandals succeeded in diverting the main threat. Once Venerable Foster became constrained, the Vandals shamelessly took advantage of their numbers to crush the diminished and worn out Hafner mechs. A disparity of two-to-one quickly grew wider and wider until the disparity surpassed a ratio of four-to-one!
No matter how well the Hafner mech pilots fought, defeat was inevitable!
"Venerable! Please run! We’ll hold them back as long as possible!" An instructor yelled. "I’ve already passed over the commands to incite the native monsters to your mech! Use them to finish off the invaders!"
Venerable Foster couldn’t afford to linger on the battlefield. She quickly came to a ruthless conclusion and turned the Mackey Craic around to run.
"Hold the Vandal scum in place! Don’t let them catch our future hope!"
Tears fell down from Foster’s cheeks as she overloaded the Mackey Craic in order to hasten her flight.
The beachhead repelled the monster horde with great difficulty. The genetically modified beasts moved in an uncoordinated mob and attacked the temporary base with mindless frenzy.
"Hold the line! Hold the line, lads!"
Though the weight of the charge almost buckled the Vandal lines, their tight grouping also became their undoing.
"Akkara mechs, open fire!"
The twenty Akkara heavy cannoneers positioned themselves at the left and right wings of the frontlines. Guarded by an ample amount of melee mechs, they unleashed a torrent of firepower at the dumb beasts whose cunning and instincts had been overridden by a genetic backdoor.
It was like shooting fish in a barrel!
The monsters pressed themselves against each other in an effort to push forward. There was not a single chance the skilled mech pilots of the Akkara heavy mechs could miss a single shot when faced with a huge wall of flesh!
Incredibly violent noises emanated from their gun barrels as they mowed down the monsters. The frenzied beasts may have been large, but they weren’t too resilient as their flesh lacked any special qualities compared to certain kinds of exobeasts.
Hafner wasn’t extravagant enough to lace the Kamwin continent with valuable exotics!
The lack of any metaphysical qualities from the beasts meant that they were basically giant bags of flesh. While their offensive strength was enough to threaten a mech, their lack of defense enabled ranged mechs like the Akkaras to play out their full strength.
Thus, even if the monster horde outnumbered the defending Vandal mechs by three-to-one, the battle slanted heavily towards the latter’s favor.
It was at this time that an alert sounded out in the command center of the Shield of Hispania.
"Sir, our sensors are detecting unusual movements from the capital city! The garrison mechs are on the move! Transports are already departing from the spaceport!"
"Where are heading?!"
"The Hafner transports are heading directly towards the beachhead!"
Some of the Vandals cursed a bit. The garrison troops finally made a move. Throughout the invasion, they had kept themselves holed up in their bunkers. Now, they finally moved out their mechs.
"Hafner must have ordered them to abandon their positions in order to reinforce Venerable Foster, sir. A newly advanced expert pilot is worth risking everything on Nova Migolatus I."
The garrison mechs didn’t bring too many mechs, and their mech pilots were a far cry from those who served in proper mech regiments. According to the intelligence provided by Peace for Hafner, the rebel group had infiltrated their ranks a lot more extensively compared to Training Camp Quistas. Their inaction up to this point could be directly attributed to rebel interference.
It was likely that the garrison troops wouldn’t fight all that hard. As long as they did the motions, their superiors wouldn’t be able to fault them that much.
However, their entry into the battlefield was enough to inconvenience the Vandals. The base defenders expended a lot of energy in trying to repel the beast horde. Many melee mechs at the frontline incurred heavy damage, while the Akkara mechs shot themselves dry.
"Make sure to service the Akkara mechs before the garrison troops arrive!"
"Yes, sir!"
Ves conveyed Major Verle’s priorities to his mech designers, leaving the matter in their hands.
The entry of the garrison troops and the unusual movements of the beasts on the Kamwin continent complicated this operation even further. What the Flagrant Vandals initially conceived as a lightning raid and assassination commission had transformed into a difficult hunt and base defense operation.
A significant amount of mech pilots lost their lives, and an even greater amount of mechs had been trashed. The Vandals lacked the time and manpower to retrieve the latter. Their losses already surpassed their expectations!
And the worst part of it was that none of their actions turned a profit!
"There’s nothing about the carcasses of those genetically modified monsters that’s worth harvesting." Ves quietly summed up. "The wrecks originating from the mechs of the training camp also isn’t enough to make up for our losses."
The more they fought, the more they lost! Scarce and precious mech pilots lost their lives while their machines were too far for the Vandals to salvage. This entire venture was an asset-draining operation. To someone sensitive to money as Ves, this was a nightmare!
"The only way to redeem ourselves is to capture Venerable Foster."
Killing her would earn the Vandals a lot of kudos from Peace for Hafner, but how much was their appreciation worth? Not very much, especially if the group insisted on sticking to the original agreement.
No, the only way for the Vandals to recoup their losses was to capture Venerable Foster alive and treat her as a valuable bargaining chip. It was impossible to convert her to the Bright Republic, but the Vandals could still hold on to her while they renegotiated their agreement with the rebel group.
If Peace for Hafner remained obstinate, then the Vandals might even be able to trade their hostage back to the Hafner Duchy!
Of course, it would be a bad idea for the Vandals to free an expert pilot with a massive grudge against them. Ves figured that the Vandals would likely pretend to entertain the Hafner Duchy’s offers in an effort to pressure Peace for Hafner into coughing up more concessions.
However, all of this depended on whether the Vandals could capture the expert pilot successfully. Capturing the ferocious Venerable was easier said than done!
Down on the surface, Venerable Foster managed to hold out for over an hour. With her comrades holding the bulk of the Vandals back, the Mackey Craic managed to disengage from the battle.
However, the Hafner mechs couldn’t hold back all of the Vandals, causing around twenty light mechs to go on pursuit.
The Vandals were wary of another counterattack, so the light mechs on her heels did not come too close. They instead pelted the Mackey Craic with the handful of ranged weapons in their possession. Though their accuracy was poor and the damage wasn’t all that much per shot, the Mackey Craic’s rear armor was much less durable than the Neyvar’s rear armor.
One of the complicating factors of the chase was that they occasionally bumped into monster groups. These beasts hadn’t made it in time to join the first horde, so they congregated into a second one. Before they joined the main group of monsters, they refrained from attacking any mechs.
However, defending themselves was another matter!
Venerable Foster cleverly dashed towards any grouping of monsters with her mech. The Mackey Craic would then tap them with its sword, causing them to grow angry and defensive. Since the beasts weren’t smart enough to distinguish which mech belonged to which side, they indiscriminately attacked every mech in the vicinity even if it belonged to her opponents!
Several times, she successfully incited the beasts and sneaked away at a critical junction. Though it didn’t take much effort for her pursuers to put down the dumb beasts, they inevitably lost a lot of time!
One time, the Vandals decided to split up into two. One group held up the beasts while the other group continued the chase.
"A chance!"
Venerable Foster impatiently drew them away from the other group before pouncing on them! Before the Vandals could adjust their defense, the Mackey Craic already ran through six mechs in quick succession!
"Scatter! Don’t engage Foster directly!"
Only after a mech captain caught up and held her back did Foster turn around and continue her flight. Venerable Foster knew very well that her mech wasn’t strong enough to finish them off.
Her counterattack served as a deterrent! If the Vandals thought they could split up and cut off her escape route, then they were badly mistaken! The Mackey Craic still possessed sufficient reserves to finish off her pursuers if they dared to split!
"Come on, you pirates! Kill me if you dare!"
She wasn’t entirely in her right mind. She recently experienced a break through and witnessed a traumatic event. The recent transformation of her mind and life phase had left her in an exhausted state. She desperately needed to rest, but the constant fighting forced her push against her limits!
"I can’t rest until these pirates are taken care of!"
Through her familiarity of the terrain and the occasional interference from the beasts, Venerable Foster managed to bleed her pursuers. She picked off a couple of mechs each time they made a mistake.
However, an hour in her flight, the Mackey Craic rapidly reached its limit. No matter how well she dodged, the shots coming from the rear occasionally landed a hit. Some of the shots even started to damage her mech’s internals, which directly impacted its performance!
In addition, the stresses she exerted on her mech slowly broke down its frame. Cracks already started seeping in, which Venerable Foster compounded each time she forced the Mackey Craic to move past its limits!
"It’s getting hot in here." She panted as she checked her heat and energy levels.
Typical to melee mechs, the Mackey Craic did not incorporate an extensive heat management system. While her mech didn’t accumulate as much heat as a laser rifleman mech, it didn’t hold as much reserves or possess any means of dumping the heat in an expedient manner.
As for the Mackey Craic’s energy reserves, the mech performed numerous extreme movements that expended large amounts of power. This mode of operation was extremely inefficient, but Venerable Foster had no choice if she wished to maintain her superiority over the Vandals. Each extreme technique wasted at least twice or thrice as much energy!
The Mackey Craic’s energy reserves dipped below twenty percent. This gave Venerable Foster very little leeway. She realized that she wouldn’t be able to shake off all of her pursuers during this time.
The only way for her to contest her fate was to fight upfront!
No matter how much she wore out her mech and her own self, she was willing to risk it all!
The Mackey Craic instantly turned around without warning and dove at the pursuing Vandal mechs with a vengeance.
"Starwalker Steps!"
Her mech moved with great momentum as it weaved through most incoming fire. Once her mech reached the closest enemy, its sword instantly flashed through a seam within the armor plating, cutting through a vital component related to the power management system!
"Redemption Slash!"
While she wasn’t a mech designer, her studies had given her an extensive understanding of the anatomy of a mech! Redemption Slash coordinated with the momentum of the mech to deliver a powerful vertical slash that could part through frontal armor with ease.
The only problem with this move was that it consumed way too much energy!
The Mackey Craic moved to the next Vandal and utilized a fast and powerful stab that poked through another universal weak point of her opponent’s mech. The sword punched through the armor with ease and penetrated a section of its engage, causing the mech to lose all of its mobility.
"Swallow Stab!"
Venerable Foster piloted her mech with great effort, trying to spare as much energy as possible. Vandal mechs pressed against the Mackey Craic on all sides. If they managed encircle her and press against her from every direction, her mech would definitely lose all of its mobility!
"Get out of my way! Double Redemption Slash!"
Slashing twice in quick succession while making both blows count was extraordinarily difficult for Foster. If she wasn’t an expert pilot, this move would have remained a possible dream for her. Right now, she managed to fell two mechs at once with this move, providing her Mackey Craic some breathing room.
Though the Vandals constantly lost mechs in their attempt to subdue Venerable Foster, they didn’t hesitate to throw in more mechs! These wave tactics forced the expert pilot to the brink. Just as she finished off the latest mech that suicided into the Mackey Craic, her mech beeped out a dangerous alarm.
"What?! How can this be?!"
The Mackey Craic’s energy reserves had dipped below five percent and was diminishing towards zero at a rapid pace!
The console that projected her mech’s current status provided her with the answer. The Vandals had directly attacked the Mackey Craic’s energy cells! Though most of them had run dry, the few remaining cells that still supplied energy to her mech had been punctured!
Before she could figure out how to escape, the Mackey Craic finally locked up! Its energy reserves completely ran dry!
"Reporting, sir, Venerable Relia Foster has been captured alive!"
"Good! Make sure to keep her sedated, and don’t give her the opportunity to commit suicide!"
Everyone on the command center cheered or sighed in relief. Ves was one of the latter, since this entire ordeal had far surpassed everyone’s limits!
"Sir, the garrison troops that landed at the other edge of the oval scar is diverting away from the beachhead! They are moving to intercept our pursuit group!"
"They are moving to rescue Venerable Foster! Don’t let them intercept our pursuit force!"
The plot depicting the positions of the mechs on the ground shifted in response. Dots representing Vandal mechs moved away from the beach head in order to cut off the approach of the Hafner garrison mechs.
This caused the Hafner mechs to adjust their course, which led to another shift from the Vandal mechs. This dance went on and on, with neither side willing to get close enough to fight it out.
The only reason why the Vandals didn’t allocate more mechs to take care of the garrison force was because they needed to fend off another wave of monsters. Now that they slaughtered hundreds of beasts, the Vandals gained a great understanding of their weaknesses. They didn’t need as much mechs to ward them off in the next attacks. It was sufficient to leave behind a single line of melee mechs while entrusting the duty of slaughtering most of the monsters to the Akkaras.
"It’s getting more chaotic here! Prepare for extraction! Make sure to chase the garrison troops away from our beachhead!"
Now that the Vandals managed to capture their prize, they had no reason to linger on the Kamwin continent. The sooner they departed they departed this star system, the better!
Ves glanced towards another plot that showed the state of the Nova Migolatus System. Two seperate fleets of combat carriers had crossed into the star system and would take less than twelve hours to reach the Vandals!
They were running out of time!
Both fleets represented entire mech regiments. One of them was a spaceborn regiment called the 3rd Silent Starpiercers. Their mech composition was made up almost entirely of cavalry mechs, more specifically lancer mechs. One or two lancer mechs might not seem so scary, but when they numbered more than eighteen-hundred mechs, a single charge could easily demolish the Flagrant Vandals even if they hadn’t split up the main fleet!
Of particular alarm to the Vandals was that the intelligence on the 3rd Silent Starpiercers mentioned that they had an expert pilot among their ranks! Venerable Cordoba Hunt piloted the same kind of lancer mech as Venerable O’Callahan, but unlike the latter Hunt was in the prime of his life.
In a contest between the two, the best result the Vandals could expect was mutual self-destruction.
"And that’s not all."
The other fleet that headed towards Nova Migolatus was made up entirely of the 7th Hostland Warriors! This was Venerable Foster’s mech regiment, and fielded both landbound and spaceborn mechs. Though their strength was nothing special, the fact that Venerable Foster hailed among their ranks meant that the Warriors wouldn’t hold anything back!
The bonds between mech pilots of the same mech regiment could rival the bonds between siblings. Everyone treated each other like family and would never hesitate to rise up and rescue a beleaguered comrade. As the villains of this story, the Flagrant Vandals would not enjoy a good end at their hands!
In short, the Vandals on the ground needed to wrap up this operation quickly to escape the calamity heading in their direction. Once the Silent Starpiercers or the Hostland Warriors caught up with the Vandal fleet in orbit, they would never be able to escape this star system!
"Come on, hurry up!"
Fortunately, in the time it took for the pursuit to return to the beachhead, the garrison troops failed to sum up the courage to attack. This allowed the pursuit force to smoothly enter the temporary base. A handful of doctors escorted by lots of armed security officers placed the unconscious expert pilot on a floating stretcher and transferred her to the heaviest transport the Vandals had on site.
"Drive the Hafner garrison mechs away from the oval scar! Don’t let them take potshots at our transports!"
Support personnel already began to dismantle the base. The pursuit force that succeeded in capturing Venerable Foster quickly paused to replenish their supplies. Every mech technician worked hard to replace their energy cells and supplement their ammunition with rapid tempo. Time was short and each mech technician needed to pull their weight.
When Ves patched into the observation systems, he watched on as his mech designers each took up responsibility over important tasks.
Vedette had the unenviable task of supervising the replenishment process. A lot of mechs from the pursuit force had sustained some damage. The impact marks from the native beasts often dented the armor of the lighter mechs. This caused certain functions to cease functioning, such as opening up the rear of the mech to allow the mech technicians to replace the energy cells.
All of this required a quick resolution. Ves saw that Vedette utilized his recent gains in his studies on mechanics to propose expedient solutions. Though they weren’t always the best, at least the man had the sense to prioritize speed over minimizing damage. Right now, they couldn’t care too much if they sent out a mech with half of its rear armor plating missing!
"He’s the most capable mech designer, but he’s the most grounded of the bunch."
Trozin on the other hand liaised with the mech pilots. Ever since the start of the Vandal ground operation, she acted as a mediator between the mech pilots and the mech technicians. Ves faintly thought she was slacking off a little too much because she didn’t do anything else besides talking.
"She hasn’t showcased her technical skills all that much, but she’s great when it comes to communicating with mech pilots."
Ves remembered that Trozin was related to a mech captain of the Vandals. Ves already looked up the connection before and found out she was the uncle of Captain Branser, who was stationed aboard the Wolf Mother.
"Right now, the Wolf Mother is part of the other fleet commanded by Colonel Lowenfield, so Trozin can’t stir up too much trouble at the moment."
As for Mercator, the other high-ranking mech designer on the ground mainly bossed around the remaining mech technicians. Though the man’s behavior was rather loathsome to Ves, the ambitious mech designer made sure that none of the mech technicians slacked off. Under his strict supervision, every technical personnel working on site exerted their utmost into keeping everyone’s mechs running.
"He’s way too abusive, but maybe that’s the only way to keep everyone’s productivity high. There’s no room for soft-heartedness in the middle of a risky operation."
All in all, the mech designers all fulfilled their roles and prevented any major jams. Transports and shuttled landed and departed from the landing site with hardly any delays. It wouldn’t take too long for the Vandals evacuate from the planet.
His only regret was that the Vandals weren’t able to retrieve all of their fallen mechs. Many of their wrecks were strewn at least an hour away from the oval scar. The roaming monsters and dense trees made it far too dangerous for them to send out transports to pick up the valuable wrecks.
While the Vandals gained a tiny bit of earnings by salvaging the mechs from the training camp, it far outweighed the losses they sustained so far. Ves roughly estimated their casualties to reach up to half of their landbound contingent!
"Leaving so many mechs behind will hurt our finances a lot." Ves murmured. "Venerable Foster hasn’t been merciful to our mech pilots either. She deliberately targeted the cockpit whenever she saw an opportunity."
The latter led to a lot of nasty glared towards the unconscious body of Venerable Foster. Still, most of the mech pilots would never condone any mistreatment of an expert pilot. Even if they ended up in captivity, they still retained their dignity!
More importantly, the Mech Trade Association paid close attention to the treatment of any expert pilot in enemy hands. The organization cared little if someone executed any captives on the battlefield or in a cell. Honestly speaking, the population of humanity had reached a mind-boggling figure. Even if only three-and-a-half percent of them could call themselves a potentate, that left way too many people left.
"An individual mech pilot is worth nothing. An expert pilot is worth an entire mech division."
This was only a figure of speech, but it highlighted the extreme valuation of expert pilots at the state level. The worth of a young and promising expert pilot such as Venerable Foster might reach as high as ten-thousand mechs!
Of course, this reference value could only be taken loosely, as states rarely paid so much in ransom for a captive mech pilot. The actual ransom payments were much more modest as states only paid a ransom up to a certain point.
Nonetheless, their captive was a real prize for which both the rebels and the Hafner Duchy would fight hard to gain. The Vandals directly gained the power to affect the balance of power over this territory.
Right now, the ground forces hurried up to evacuate their beachhead at the oval scar. They successfully managed to evacuate over half of their mechs so far. After driving away the timid garrison mechs, the Vandals bought enough time to evacuate the other half of their mech force.
The ground force left a lot of supplies and other goods in their hasty evacuation. They simply didn’t have the time to attend to these matters as the Silent Starpiercers and the Hostland Warriors
"We’ve retrieved all of our essentials from the surface, sir!"
"Begin our departure from the system!"
The Verle Task Force moved towards the nearest Lagrange point. However, just like on the surface, the Vandals also needed to be wary of the garrison fleet that miraculously kept themselves alive during this operation. Their fast and nimble combat carriers continuously played hide and seek against the spaceborn mechs the Vandals sent in pursuit.
Right now, they formed the largest threat to their escape. As long as they continued to pester the Vandals, they could easily prevent any transitions.
"These cowardly garrison combat carriers are a thorn in our sides." Major Verle stated. "It’s a good thing we’ve come up with a plan."
The only way the Vandals could halt the pestering was if they made some sacrifices. At first, they retracted all of their spaceborn mechs as the fleet moved towards a Lagrange point.
This lured the garrison fleet closer to the Vandals. It didn’t take too much time for them to enter into range. Some of their mechs already started firing at the Vandal combat carriers.
"Begin!"
However, just as the Hafner spaceborn mechs began to get comfortable, all of the Inheritors and Hellcats boosted from the fleet and overloaded their flight systems! Their rapid acceleration towards the garrison fleet alarmed the Hafner mechs. They quickly boarded their high-speed carriers in an attempt to dance out of reach.
Due to the modest head-start of the Vandal mechs, the garrison fleet risked getting caught. This only prompted the stripped-down Hafner combat carriers to accelerate even faster.
This chase lingered on for half an hour. The Vandal mechs had ceased to overload their flight system, but they still posed a large threat to the Hafner mechs.
Just then, the Vandal mechs collectively turned around and burned back to the task force. They never intended to catch up to the garrison fleet!
As the Inheritors and Hellcats burned their way back to their motherships, the garrison fleet halted their acceleration in confusion. Eventually, they realized what the Vandals were up to and frantically turned around their ships to return to the vicinity of the Vandal fleet!
"Hah! I knew they were scared!" Major Verle exclaimed. "Just like their landbound force, the spaceborn garrison fleet is full of rot. They clearly treasure their lives over the mission."
The Vandals gained a decisive delta-v advantage through their maneuvers. Simply said, the garrison fleet had run away so eagerly that it took a lot of time for their ships to turn around and catch up to their targets. It would take at least fifteen to twenty minutes for their mechs to be in range to disrupt their enemy’s attempt to transition into FTL.
"Too late!"
The entire task force successfully entered into FTL with more than enough time to spare. The impotent garrison fleet could only watch on as their cowardice allowed their prey to slip away untouched.
The Flagrant Vandals made it out!
Those who fought on the surface almost couldn’t believe they made it out of hell. Pretty much all of the mech pilots came out of their mechs in a broken state. Though they admirably held themselves together on the field due to their training, once they returned to safety the trauma seeped through the cracks.
Ves and Chief Haine stood on a ramp overlooking one of the hangar bays of the Shield of Hispania. They watched on as mech technicians carefully peeled open the cockpits of heavily damaged landbound mechs to reach the mech pilots trapped inside.
Throughout it all, the overall mood in the hangar bay was depressing. While the inherent resilience of the Flagrant Vandals prevented them from lashing out or doing anything drastic, Ves sensed nothing good from the men.
"Have the Vandals always sustained so many losses in a single campaign?" Ves asked.
"Plenty." The chief technician replied. "Just not in big battles like this. Ordinarily, we don’t like to move in huge formations and pit our mechs against anything tough. Normally, we split up in smaller squadrons and spent most of our time raiding Vesian shipping lines. Sometimes, we’re able to catch a juicy convoy, and in other times, we end up bumping our noses into a patrol. All of those skirmishes takes a toll on our numbers."
"I see. So the Vandals are used to losses, but only in bite-sized packages."
The chief glanced at Ves with a cool expression. "Mr. Larkinson, we are soldiers above else. We aren’t cowards who value our lives above anything else. Even if the Mech Corps doesn’t regard us very highly, within ourselves lies the hope that we can prove ourselves to be equal to those shining mech regiments that have become household names in the Republic."
Mech regiments such as the Stellar Lancers, the Infernal Hellhounds and the Volari Starhawks all enjoyed significant renown back home. Their funding and support was incomparable to the Flagrant Vandals.
Ves could see how the pride of those who had been forced onto the Vandals had been impugned. If Ves was a mech pilot who had been thrown into this garbage bin of a mech regiment, he too would have wished to prove himself in battle.
"I mean no disrespect, Chief Haine. It’s just that the civilian in me can’t get used to seeing so many comrades fall. How can the Vandals push on and keep their heads high?"
"Everyone deals with loss in a different way. The survivors are taken care of. We’re not clueless in that regard. Soldier or not, humans are fragile. From the moment our civilization has ascended to the stars, we’ve become very good at handling trauma."
Ves nodded. He could see that a number of mental health specialists already started receiving the mech pilots who emerged from the cockpits. Ves ordinarily ignored the specialists since they hardly did anything but take up space, but right now they were worth their weight in gold.
"A lot of our landbound mechs got trashed. You’ve got a lot of work ahead of yourself if you want to salvage something out of this mess."
"I know." Ves laughed sardonically at himself. "I don’t even look at the latest figures anymore. I’m scared I’ll get a heart attack once I see how many mechs we’ve lost and how many wrecks we need to restore. Those giant monsters on the Kamwin continent aren’t gentle at all."
A large proportion of mechs that got trashed consisted of melee mechs that received an awful battering from the monster hordes. The monsters attacked with a combination of blunt and cutting forces that combined resulted in some of the most awful sort of damage to the mechs.
"The damage to the melee mechs that got smacked around by the monsters is incredibly arduous to fix. It’s different from the mechs that Venerable Foster managed to down. That feisty girl always tried to finish off her opponents as expediently as possible, so most of the damage we’ve incurred from her is concentrated on a small set of critically damaged components."
Ves understood her point. "On the other hand, the mechs that incurred damage from the monsters require a complete overhaul. All of that blunt force has penetrated through the surface armor of our mechs. The damage to their internals is extensive, and it will take lots of time to pin down which component needs to be replaced."
Leaving out the wrecks that the Vandals had been forced to leave behind, the Vandals hadn’t sustained too much material damage. Any damaged mech they managed to retrieve could be fixed up over time as the mech technicians could easily take out a damaged parts and recycle them in order fabricate replacement parts.
The only problem was that this would take way too much time with their current equipment and manpower.
Without the industrial capacity of the Wolf Mother, the Verle Task Force needed years to make up all of the losses they sustained. Their landbound contingent was in shambles while their spaceborn contingent never regained their prime.
"Our spaceborn battle efficiency isn’t too bad, so it is not the end of the galaxy." The chief patted his back in an attempt to console him. "Repairing the landbound mechs is a megaproject. No one expects you to fix everything up. Right now, it’s more important to finish our mission and return home before we can consider rebuilding our forces."
She was right. The Vandals went through hell and almost reached the gates that led to heaven. Once they crossed the borders of the Hafner Duchy, they would finally be able to breathe easily as they didn’t have to worry about constant ambushes from the reigning power in the region.
Though the Reinald Republic wasn’t exactly an ally of the Bright Republic, their shared enemy kept their relations fairly cordial. It wasn’t uncommon to see Brighter ships trawling about in Reinald space and vica versa.
Many of the larger Brighter companies established subsidiaries in the Reinald Republic. The Flagrant Vandals would be able to gain preferential treatment from them. The Vandals counted on this to be their deliverance after this ordeal was over.
"What happens next?"
"That depends, Mr. Larkinson. We’ve captured an expert pilot at a very great cost. If I was the Major, I would be very eager to trade her away for some much-needed concessions."
"Major Verle is going to try to play the rebels against Hafner, I bet."
"He’ll be playing a very dangerous game. The thing about negotiating is that it works best if nobody is aware of what others want. Right now, it’s plain to see that every side wants."
The Flagrant Vandals wanted to cross the borders.
The Hafner Duchy wanted their precious expert pilot back.
The rebels wanted to weaken the Hafner Duchy.
"The negotiation is going to be a dance." Ves guessed. "Each side will go through the motions, but I think everyone has already settled on an outcome."
"The process is still important. It can decide whether we’ll enjoy the bulk of the rewards or if our rebel partners will lay claim to the lion’s share of the spoils."
From what Ves could see, the only way to please all three sides was to involve everyone in the same transaction. Venerable Foster was the main prize. While it would have been better for the Bright Republic to deny her release, she wasn’t very useful to the Vandals.
It was like having access to a huge bank account. Would the impressive figure be able to save his life if someone pointed a gun at Ves?
No!
Right now, the Vandals desperately needed to raise their strength. Trading away an expert pilot despite the huge threat she posed to her enemies in the future was more attractive than squirreling her away like a lump of precious ore.
Considering the sheer value of a young and healthy expert pilot, the Hafner Duchy would likely be willing to bleed really hard to get her back.
Of course, the Vandals hadn’t been able to capture her by themselves. Peace for Hafner helped a lot in the background, from providing actionable intelligence to sabotaging the Hafner forces from within.
Their help was especially valuable at the end where their double agents caused the garrison fleet to waver at critical moments! Therefore, the interests of Peace for Hafner shouldn’t be neglected.
Besides, considering that the Verle Task Force was about to enter the Reinald Republic, making the rebel group happy was an important concern. Though no Reinald official ever confirmed the rumors, it was pretty much an open secret that the rebel groups operating in Hafner space were Reinald’s sock puppets.
"I hope that we’ve got some competent negotiators among our ranks, then." Ves muttered. "In any case, these mechs won’t get serviced by themselves. Let’s get to work, shall we?"
Ves took stock of the damage together with Chief Haine. He studied the abuse the landbound mechs had suffered from the blunt force impacts from the rampaging monsters. Though he only inspected a small sample, the damage looked worse than he thought.
The beasts possessed a weak defense, but a powerful offense! Any mech that tussled with the monsters of the Kamwin continent up close required a complete disassembly. The main reason for this was that in some cases, the internal frame had been affected!
"It’s going to take multiple days of work from an entire group of mech technicians to fix one of these damaged landbound mechs." Ves concluded morosely. "That doesn’t sound so bad if only a handful of mechs require such treatment, but we’re talking about close to two-hundred machines here."
Chief Haine had been right that the Vandals didn’t plan on fighting anymore landbound battles for the foreseeable time. However, Ves did not believe that everything would end once they reached the Reinald Republic. He already started casting his gaze on what the task force would be doing next.
"Will we really be returning to the Bright Republic for a lengthy downtime?"
Somehow, Ves did not believe this odyssey would end so soon. At the very least, the matter with Lord Javier and his secret presence aboard the Shield of Hispania foreshadowed a continuation of their secret movements.
"What’s so important about Lord Javier and why is it so important to reach the Reinald Republic within a certain time?"
Ves still couldn’t connect the dots despite the vast amount of data at his fingertips. In fact, the awful state of the Vandals made it clear that they weren’t ready for another major operation at all. He dearly hoped that bigwigs didn’t have another difficult mission in store for them once they reached the end of the journey.
After taking stock of the situation at the hangar bays, Ves returned to his office to draw up a new schedule. The original one he composed more than a month ago was plainly unworkable considering how much the Vandals had been set back.
When he entered his office, Ves saw that Iris wasn’t present at her desk.
"She’s probably helping with the negotiations."
Ves wondered if he would soon be saying goodbye to Iris. Now that the Vandals were about to reach their destination, they had no need to trade for favors from the rebel movements that made themselves home in the Vesia Kingdom.
Realizing that she would soon be out of his life, Ves realized that he would miss her presence. She had been of great assistance to Ves. Not only did she introduce him to neural interface technology, she also deepened his understanding of Vesian culture and military.
"I’ll have to prepare a farewell gift to her." He affirmed to himself. "Perhaps once the war is over, she’ll finally smarten up and give up on her unrealistic dream to turn the Kingdom away from feudalism."
Ves chuckled to himself. Sometimes he had the feeling that nothing would ever change. The Bright Republic and Vesia Kingdom would likely look the same a hundred years from now.
He wouldn’t know what to do if something changed.
"So that’s an expert pilot."
Later in the day, Ves had been invited by Major Verle to the medical bay. They walked past numerous pods where the bodies of heavily-injured mech pilots bathed in strange solutions that slowly restored their bodies.
These days, machines performed most medical treatments. They worked much more precise and extensively than humans. Though the risk of tampering remained, the medical machines were subjected to strict and frequent inspections. A modern-day doctor was both a medical specialist and a machine operator.
To Ves, doctors were like mech technicians. The only differences were that they possessed better degrees and worked with living bodies instead of cold, mechanical machines.
Doctor Eric Cuscar greeted the two at the end of the medical bay. As the chief medical officer, Cuscar was the most senior and knowledgeable doctor in the entire task force. He was also responsible for keeping tabs on Ves’ abnormal body.
"Doctor." Major Verle greeted the old man with a nod. "How’s the little girl?"
Cuscar deliberately coughed in his hand. "I suggest you mind your manners, major. The ’little girl’ you are referring to is a superhuman mech pilot! She’s a genuine marvel of the human potential! I’m gathering bucketloads of data right at this moment!"
"You didn’t answer my question, doc. How is she doing?"
"Ah, ahem, Venerable Foster is not in a good state. She broke through under great stress and in less than ideal circumstances. That she advanced to expert when she was several steps away is a testament to her talent. I’ve treated several expert pilots in my life, and each one is a unique work of art shaped by a combination of nature and human influence. The potential of my latest patient is hands down the best I’ve ever laid my eyes on!"
The doctor’s excitement was palpable from the amount of spittle that escaped his mouth. Both Ves and Major Verle inched away in order to avoid getting hit by friendly fire.
"What makes her special compared to the other expert pilots you’ve treated?" Ves asked.
"As I’ve already mentioned, her genes are exquisitely perfect! In addition to that, she contains more activated genes that are known to be beneficial to mech pilots than every other expert pilot that I’ve laid my eyes on. The simplest way to put it is that her body has a lot of good switches, and most of them are flicked in the right way."
Ves wasn’t a complete novice on expert pilots. It was everyone’s dream to advance into an expert pilot, so the general population knew what a mech pilot required in order to reach this height.
First, they needed the right genetics! Just as humans could be divided into norms and potentates, the latter group in turn fit into different subcategories.
The most expedient way to categorize potentates was to measure their genetic aptitude. Biomedical experts who specialized in studying the physiology of mech pilots utilized many different measures to classify their strengths. However, laypeople mainly referred to a single summarized grade that ranged from A to F.
Genetic aptitude was a complex concept in itself. All Ves knew about it was that it signified how strong a potentate’s gene expressions would facilitate the act of interfacing with a mech.
Ves possessed a genetic aptitude of F. This meant that his brain might as well be a rock when he tried to interface with a mech. No matter how hard he tried, his mind and body firmly rejected any attempts at engaging with the interface. In fact, if Ves tried to force a connection, his brains would likely suffer permanent brain damage.
Potentates with a genetic aptitude of E could barely be called mech pilots at all even when trained. They comprise a fairly small chunk of potentates, so most people who fell into this category resigned themselves into becoming the reserves of the reserves. A state wouldn’t put them into a mech unless they started to scrape the bottom of the barrel in terms of manpower.
Ves remembered witnessing one mech pilot with a probable genetic aptitude of E or E-. Only with such a low blessing would Leviticus have trouble making basic movements as he competed against other mech duelists in one of Bentheim’s many mech arenas.
Aptitudes ranging from D to B comprise the vast majority of mech pilots.
Mech pilots whose aptitudes fell into the D-range mostly ended up piloting frontline mechs when they served or industrial mechs if they remained civilians. Though they weren’t particularly valuable, there was a lot of them, so states rarely let them go to waste.
Potentates with aptitudes in the C-range mainly consisted of the rank and file of every mech force. They possessed enough talent to pilot a humanoid or bestial mech proficiently. However, for every mech pilot with a C-range aptitude, there were at least two mech pilots with a D-range aptitude. Their relative scarcity meant that states cherished them pretty deeply.
Those with aptitudes that reached up to the B-range could be called winners in life. Their piloting careers were bound to be smooth, and they could easily pilot advanced mechs as extensions of their own limbs.
Due to focused genetic breeding and all kinds of other medical voodoo kept out of sight, the offspring of the Larkinsons mainly fell under this enviable category. The Larkinsons wouldn’t be much of a military dynasty if their genes weren’t so fortuitous, which they inherited from the Larkinson Ancestor.
Ves in fact possessed many of those genes as well, but there was more to genetic aptitude than having the right materials in place. The problem in his case was that his body refused to make use of those materials. Instead, it pretty much left them into the dust, treating them as nothing more than junk.
This was the special part about Venerable Foster. Not only did she possess the right materials, her body also utilized most of them to construct a beautiful palace that allowed her to advance higher than anybody else.
"A genetic aptitude of A is extremely rare." Doctor Cuscar lamented. "It’s such a shame that the Mech Corps never assigns their prodigies to the Flagrant Vandals. My understanding of these blessed mech pilots is far too lacking!"
"What about Venerable O’Callahan? Doesn’t he have an A-grade genetic aptitude as well?" Ves asked.
The doctor snorted. "That old man’s body is only useful for studying how long a human can cling to life in their final moments. Besides, Venerable O’Callahan only works with his own medical team. He’s keeping his cards close to himself. I think his actual genetic aptitude is closer to B rather than A, if you ask me."
Both Ves and Major Verle nodded in understanding. Genetic aptitude didn’t signify whether a mech pilot halted at advanced pilot or not. There had even been cases where losers with D-grade aptitudes had somehow lucked out and advanced to experts!
Naturally, this almost never happened in reality. There was a direct correlation between the probability of advancing into an expert and genetic aptitude. The higher the grade, the more likely someone would be able to break through. However, even for a blessed potentate with A-grade aptitude, their odds of advancing at all was smaller than a percent!
"I can’t help but marvel at the sight of Venerable Foster’s aptitude." Doctor Cuscar praised as he approached a control panel that operated the complex medical machinery in the chamber beyond. "If you look at her brain scans, you can see that they are much more divergent than a more average mech pilot. The high plasticity of her brain cells essentially allows her subconsciousness to rewire their brains to better facilitate a neural connection! This is also a benefit of her youth. If she was as old as Venerable O’Callahan, she would never have been able to present such a remarkable nervous system!"
Ves and Major Verle could barely follow Doctor Cuscar’s commentary. They simply watched through the transparent viewscreen as Venerable Foster’s sedated body covered in a thin wrap received various proddings and injections.
"She isn’t getting worse, is she?"
"The Venerable is stronger than she looks. Don’t you worry Mr. Larkinson, she’ll be as right as rain once I fix her up. Right now, her body needs lots of rest to stabilize her life phase as well as lots of nutrients to allow her body to finish its transformation. The transition from mortal to superhuman is truly a wonder to behold!"
It was obvious that Venerable Foster wouldn’t be waking up anytime soon. This disappointed Ves for a bit, but it also provided him with an extra cushion of safety for what he was about to do. He had always wanted to flex his Spirituality with others. He wanted to do more with this Attribute than using it to bestow his works with the X-Factor.
Thus, as Major Verle discussed some matters with Doctor Cuscar, Ves quietly stared at the prone body of the expert pilot while extending out an invisible tendril of thought.
Ves never really managed to accomplish anything when he reached out to a baseline human. Neither norms or mech pilots showed any signs of being affected by his Spirituality. It was as if they consisted of nothing but air!
He theorized that most of the shenanigans that revolved around his Spirituality actually happened in a parallel dimension that Ves loosely referred to as the imaginary realm. Any human being with a deficient Spirituality didn’t have the qualifications to enter this realm. This worked both ways, so entities in the imaginary realm wouldn’t be able to affect that vast majority of humanity.
His current experiment was important to him, because Ves hypothesized that expert pilots partially derived their special powers from expressing their own brand of spirituality. It was the only variable that Ves could think of that could conceivably explain the magic that they performed.
He tuned out everything else and urged his mind probe to reach the unconscious woman. Just as it reached Venerable Foster’s body, Ves faintly felt a small amount of feedback from his tendril!
It worked!"
Half a minute went by as Ves carefully brushed against something that felt like cotton. Whatever spirituality Venerable Foster possessed, it was extremely weak and poreus. If Ves didn’t specifically look out for it, he might never have noticed its presence in the first place!
Ves was very glad right now that once of his assumptions had been proven right. Spirituality may be one of the keys that allowed a mech pilot to advance to an expert pilot! Though this was just a preliminary result, if proven to be correct, this insight could change the galaxy forever!
Most humans stumbled blindly in their attempts to find a way for mech pilots to break through the bottleneck. If Ves casually leaked out his findings, he would doubtlessly unleash a storm of epic proportions in human space!
Once he realized the immensity of his experiment, he quickly dissipated the mental probe and kept his mouth firmly pressed together. He walked away from the transparent screen and turned around as if he grew bored from watching an unconscious mech pilot.
Major Verle paused his discussion with Doctor Cuscar and turned to Ves. "Have you taken a good glimpse at her? How does she measure up compared to the expert pilots in your family?"
"We only have three expert pilots in our family. Two of them lost their strength and were forced to retire. Our only active expert is holed up in Citadel Havensworth for much of my life. I hardly ever saw the hero."
"Colonel Ark Larkinson. A good man. He is truly a shining example for the Mech Corps." Major Verle complimented without any sarcasm. "So is Venerable Foster worse than Venerable Larkinson?"
Ves shrugged. "How could I tell? Uncle Ark is strong, but he isn’t young anymore. Venerable Foster could potentially reach a greater height than him. What do you think, doctor?"
"Her potentially is frightfully high." Doctor Cuscar slowly said. "I don’t think you realize the import of my statement. She’s a mech pilot who won the jackpot multiple times she played the slot machine. I would dare say that we’re not keeping an expert pilot in our custody. Instead, we’re looking at a future ace candidate!"
Ace candidate! Ves widened his eyes, and so did the mech officer standing next to him. An expert pilot that had the potential to advance to the next step in the road to godhood was practically extinct in much of the Komodo Star Sector! The only aces that have ever emerged in this part of space all came from the second-rate states.
For Hafner to have been blessed with an ace candidate was of enormous significance to the balance of power between the Vesia Kingdom and its neighbors!
After visiting Venerable Foster, Ves gained a wholly new understanding of the higher ranks of mech pilots. He now understood a little better why humanity worshipped them. Their strength and force of will transcended the boundaries of mortal men.
"They may even be the vanguard of the future evolution of humanity."
In the Age of Mechs, no human enjoyed more renown than mech pilots. There was a very strong desire for parents to give birth to potentates. Though mech pilots often risked their lives, there was no greater glory for a human to pilot a mech.
This had led to a very strong desire to breed for genetic aptitude. Though the proportion of potentates to norms hadn’t changed all that much in the last four-hundred years, researchers understood more about genetic aptitude than ever before. Certain families and organizations such as the Larkinsons grasped some profound means to vastly increase the odds of birthing a potentate.
Of course, the Larkinsons paid a heavy price to fund these special treatments. Without money and the right genetics, it was impossible for the vast majority of humanity to enjoy the same opportunity. Even then, there were limits to human intervention. The occurrence of A-grade genetic aptitude was completely up to chance.
Venerable Foster was truly a unique specimen in the Hafner Duchy.
Almost a week had passed since they departed from the Nova Migolatus System. The entire task force fell into a depressingly familiar routine. The Vandals mourned their losses but also pulled up their sleeves and went to work. Countless mech technicians scoured over the damaged mechs and prioritized the repair of the least-damages ones.
Once they emerged from FTL, the fleet conducted the biggest space burial ceremony as of yet. Every Vandal shared the pain of loving a close brother or sister, and Major Verle had done his best to get them to look forward to the future.
After that, the Vandals mostly turned back to normal, though there was a rising undercurrent of discontent among the rank-and-file. Ves heard the usual talk of deserting the Mech Corps, but this time a lot more people shared the same opinions.
Ves didn’t think this was a good sign. The Vandals always had a tendency to speak their minds. It was a way of venting their frustrations whenever they got dealt a bad hand. The battle on the Kamwin continent had been a lot more deadly than everyone initially expected.
People started asking again why they fought these battles in the first place.
"We’re not a battlefield regiment! This high-risk journey through half of the Kingdom is insane!"
"If I was Colonel Lowenfield, I would have taken the entire fleet away from this depressing corner of the galaxy. With a full mech regiment at her back, she can mix with lots of different outfits."
"I should have joined a mercenary corps instead of the Mech Corps. Pah, what does all of this talk of pride and glory has to do with us? It’s the big wigs who are earning all of the glory! They don’t even have the guts to step on the battlefield in person, but they’re the first ones to step forward when it comes to taking credit!"
No matter where he went, Ves continued to pick up borderline treasonous talk. It made him profoundly uncomfortable when he visited the mess hall to eat his meals or went down to the hangar bays to inspect the repair work.
It had even birthed a faint suspicion in his paranoid mind. Was their trip to the Reinald Republic a one-way journey?
"Whatever is happening, it shouldn’t take too long for some of the truth to come out."
During their time of recuperation, the task force continued to approach Hafner’s borders. It wouldn’t take too long before they finally arrived at the barrier of heavily-patrolled star systems.
Ships that made use of standard FTL drives had no way to surmount this barrier. The stars on both sides tended to be dim and small, which meant they were far from energetic enough for ships to dial into their coordinates from afar. There weren’t any port systems in the vicinity either.
This basically meant that ships crossing the border needed to take multiple stops in order to avoid any accidents. This was akin to walking through a forest in the dark. People needed to take one step at a time in order to prevent anyone from smacking into a wall.
Throughout this buffer time, rumors continued to disseminate about the negotiations. Some of them had a lot of basis in fact, but it was difficult for Ves to take them for granted.
Ves wanted to cut through the falsehoods, so he went straight to one of the sources. He invited Iris to come up to one of the Shield of Hispania’s lounges after their shift had ended.
"Mr. Larkinson! Why did you invite me up here?"
The lounge that Ves had picked out was a prime relaxation area for the ship’s warrant officers and more junior commissioned officers. The Vandal mech pilots and mech officers tended to favor their own watering holes in the lower decks.
The luxuriously-furnished lounge was situated at the upper deck and ordinarily featured an observatory that allowed everyone to look up at the stars.
Right now, the task force was submerged in FTL travel, so thick plates of armor shielded up the transparent dome. Looking out at the higher dimensions had a tendency to make some people nauseous or worse.
Ves waved at Iris and beckoned her to join him at a corner. A discrete privacy screen surrounded the corner, which prevented others from eavesdropping on them. This was very helpful for off-duty officers who wanted to discuss sensitive matters outside of their work environment. Naturally, the ship’s monitoring system still recorded every word that was being said.
Once Iris sat down, Ves invited her to order a drink. "Come. It’s my treat."
Seconds after they ordered their drinks, a small floating serving bot arrived to deliver their chosen poison.
Ves took a swig of his mug of heavy stout. He almost spat it out right after. "Damnit! How can the Vandals be so cheap?! This is synthesized from nutrient packs!"
The woman sitting opposite to him smiled amusedly at him. "What do you expect? They spend the vast majority of their funds on keeping their mechs and ships together. They have no energy to waste on procuring authentic food and drinks."
He had already become used to meals derived from nutrient packs. The only times he got to enjoy authentic food these days was when Major Verle held an elaborate dinner occasion. At least the big boss knew how to enjoy himself. Ves couldn’t imagine what kind of foodstuffs the mech officer squirreled away.
"You must be wondering why I asked to meet with you here."
"The thought did cross my mind."
Both of them shed the veneer of formality they normally wore while on duty. This would have been a lot less common in Vesian circles. Even the rebels that advocated for the overthrow of the nobility still couldn’t shake off the class system that had been imposed on them for all their lives.
However, Iris had mingled with the Vandals for almost two months now. Her continued exposure to how the Vandals treated each other had opened her eyes.
"Our journey is almost at an end. From what I can see, we’ll be crossing the border one way or another within the week. This might be the last time our lives intersect with each other."
The female mech designer smiled. "It’s been a wild ride, hasn’t it?"
"It’s not what I expected when the Mech Corps drafted me. I originally thought I would spend the entire war stuffed inside a hidden research base buried somewhere covert deep in Republic space. Did you know that I worked hard to advance my career in order to avoid getting sent to the frontlines? Hah! Look where that got me."
"Well, it doesn’t appear you’ve suffered loss, Ves. Look at you now. You’re the temporary head designer of this fleet. Although you aren’t as capable as Professor Velten, you’re gaining valuable experience in a role that is hard to come by."
"My job isn’t as comfy as it sounds. I’ve been working very hard each day and it demands the utmost of my capability. Everything would be twice as easy if I was a Journeyman Mech Designer. My own subordinates wouldn’t doubt me all the time."
"Are Trozin and Mercator stirring up some trouble again?"
"Not particularly." He shook his head. "They used to deviate from my orders or interpret them in an unusual manner. They’ve quieted down ever since we’ve departed from the Nova Migolatus System. Maybe their time on the field has done them some good."
"Didn’t you send that other guy down there as well?"
"That’s Vedette." Ves palmed his face when he thought of the low-ranking mech designer. "All I wanted was to stiffen him up. He hadn’t even been exposed to any threats to his life, yet once he came back from his deployment it’s like he turned into a mouse. According to the mental health professionals who examined him, he’s actually suffering from PTSD!"
Of course, this condition wasn’t hard to treat these days. The doctors injected Vedette with some drugs and put him through some kind of program that unscrambled his brains. The only problem was that it took some time for the treatment program to bear results.
"Not everyone can be like you, who survived all alone for a while on Detemen IV. You’re a lot more dangerous than you look."
Ves laughed. "That’s because I bump into danger far too often. It’s partially my fault. The galaxy is a wondrous place. There’s so much treasure to be unearthed from the frontier. Sometimes I yearn to follow in the footsteps of the treasure hunters that ply the untamed stars."
"I can’t imagine living an uncertain life like that. For me, I have only the VRF in mind. The rebel cause is my cause. As long as my people remain under the oppression of the nobles and royals, my duty still remains."
"That sounds... admirable."
"I know what you are thinking." She shook her head. "You don’t need to hide your true thoughts. We know each other well enough to see the truth in our eyes. You don’t believe we have a chance of success, do you?"
"I can’t understand why you are committed to your state."
"That’s because it’s my home. Even if I hate it, I can never let my fellow Vesians wallow in their misery."
Ves truly couldn’t see the point. No matter how many times Iris explained her conviction, he would never understand her stubborn commitment to an ugly state.
They tactfully shifted to another topic.
"Anyway, the reason why I wanted to meet with you here is because I wanted to give you a gift before we say our farewells."
Iris nodded. "I can’t say much about the three-way negotiations that is going on between the Flagrant Vandals, the Hafner Duchy and Peace for Hafner, but we’re already in the process of finalizing an agreement. Hafner values Venerable Foster’s potential a lot. That has given us a lot of chips to bargain with. You can bet that safe passage is highly possible for the task force."
"I don’t believe that the rest of the Kingdom will be happy at Hafner if they grant us safe passage out of their territory." Ves frowned.
"Although the chance is minute, Venerable Foster has a small chance of advancing to ace pilot. Compared to the possibility of obtaining their own ace pilot, Hafner is willing to endure all sorts of recrimination from the other duchies."
Ves frowned a little deeper. He already knew her potential to be high, but it seemed he underestimated her value. "A part of me wishes that she’ll never be let go. The prospect of freeing a potential ace pilot is giving me the chills."
There was no doubt that Venerable Foster had developed an undying hatred for the Flagrant Vandals and the Bright Republic. Letting her loose might lead to a calamity in the future. It was too bad that the Vandals really couldn’t afford to hold on to her. If they didn’t ransom her back to the duchy, the Hafners would likely hound them to the ends of the galaxy!
Ves and Iris chatted about their lives for the rest of the evening. The Vesian guest designer got to hear how he won the Leemar Open Competition and became an apprentice to Master Olson. Ves got to learn that the MTA offered a staff position to Iris.
"That’s an incredible opportunity!" Ves remarked. "Anyone who receives an invitation from the MTA will surely experience the best of what humanity has to offer! Why did you turn it down?"
"The MTA is a neutral organization. It’s not a place for old loyalties. The MTA has made it abundantly clear that once you join their ranks, you’ll never be able to return to your state. Anyone who accepts their offers has to sign a lifetime contract with them. Every bond has to be severed. This not only includes your sentiments for your state, but also entails a clean break from your friends and family."
To a person who cherishes her bonds, such a condition was unacceptable. Though no organization was truly neutral, the MTA came darned close, but it was not without a price.
"I heard that the MTA often assigns its staff members all over human space. Those who are serving in the rim are transferred to the galactic heartland and galactic center. Those who originate from the galactic center are shuffled far away from their prosperous stars."
"That’s because it’s too easy for an official from the MTA to act on their biases. If one day you happen to be promoted to a position overlooking the entire Komodo Star Sector, can you resist the temptation to make things easier for the Bright Republic?"
Ves was no saint. "I don’t think anyone can remain neutral in that case."
"That’s why the best way to sort out this problem is to send every association member at least fifty-thousand light years away from their home state. This is more than enough distance for their people to become estranged to their former states. Even if you can remain in contact with your family through the galactic net, the distance is so vast that even your closest family members will become distance concerns after a few decades."
It was certainly a drastic measure in his eyes. If Ves received the same offer on day, he too wouldn’t be so eager to join their ranks. Although every member of the MTA had access to the best technologies, all of their work would one day become property of the MTA. There was no room for any individuality in their ranks.
"The Mech Trade Association is a great organization. They’re the only bunch in the galaxy besides the CFA who have managed to impose some sensible rules across all of human space. It’s just too bad that the Big Two haven’t been able to take the next step."
Iris chuckled at his words. "It’s been done before. The galaxy is way too big to be ruled by a single nation. It’s pure fantasy at this point."
"Well, the future is still in flux. There’s always a chance that humanity will one day unite under a single banner."
No state called themselves a country or a nation. This was because they lacked the confidence to proclaim their sovereignty over the territories they ruled.
It used to be different in the Age of Conquest. Various star nations all claimed to be the blessed stars of humanity and started to become conceited against other sovereign nations. The animosity that grew between the star nations eventually escalated from minor border conflicts into full-fledged wars, and from there these conflicts escalated into a race to extinction.
It was a good thing the MTA and CFA showed up at the end to smack some sense into the so-called star nations. Ever since then, the Big Two imposed a number of rules and taboos. Taking away the warships was especially fatal to the star nations. They could no longer hold themselves with their heads held high because without any warfleets to defend themselves against other warships, there were no longer capable of safeguarding their borders by themselves.
It was no wonder that people started referring to the emasculated nations as states.
"By the way, what was that about a gift earlier?"
"Ah, it almost slipped through my mind. I wanted to pass on a gift to you before you left. It’s just something to commemorate your time as a guest designer among our ranks."
Ves pulled up a small square gift box and passed it over to Iris across the table.
"What’s this?"
"Open it up." Ves encouraged her with a smile.
Iris eagerly opened up the box to reveal a strange gift. "What is this?"
"It’s a miniature mech."
Ves spent a couple of hours fabricating a miniaturized mech that resembled the Hellcat hybrid knight. He could have fabricated it within seconds if he wanted to produce a toy, but Ves went the extra mile and created a partially functional mech that was scaled down to the size of a hand.
It was an excellent example of craftsmanship to Ves. He not only infused the model with his understanding of the Hellcat model, he also spent a lot of thought in shrinking down the different components and finding substitutes for unworkable materials. While there wouldn’t be any human small enough to pilot the mech through the tiny cockpit, he did manage to incorporate a remote control feature into the tiny machine.
For some reason, Iris threw him a weird glance and shook her head. "It’s an amusing curiosity. I can see that’s it’s pretty functional."
"If you supply its miniaturized nail drivers and missile launchers with appropriately-sized ordnance, the mini Hellcat can actually fire them out. And you best be careful of its sword. It’s sharp enough to stab someone in the chest."
Though she initially treated the model casually, her eyebrows began to furrow as she studied it further. She rotated it carefully around her delicate fingers. "I recognize these materials. This is compressed armor! Did you waste exotics on this toy!?"
"How else will it be so authentic?"
She frowned a bit at that. "Won’t you get in trouble with the Flagrant Vandals for reproducing one of their signature designs?"
"Oh, It’s fine. The mini model isn’t a replica of the Hellcat. I don’t even have complete access to its design specifications. You can say it’s my own spin on its concept. The miniature is cosmetically similar to the Hellcat, but its internals looks completely differently. If it is scaled up to full size, its specs won’t be as good as the real deal."
The woman traced the surface of the tiny mech with her fingers. "There’s something strange about this gift of yours. It’s like the model is warm to the touch without actually feeling my hands getting hotter. It’s like you’ve added in its air of pride and aggression! Why do I feel it’s not just a toy?"
"That’s because the model is a carrier of my own design philosophy." Ves sent her an enigmatic smile. "If you can study it, you might be able to glimpse what makes it so special."
Ves had struggled hard to come up with a gift that Iris would appreciate. He settled on handcrafting his own miniature mech according to his own style. This wouldn’t be just a normal miniature, but one which exhibited a trace of X-Factor. Accomplishing that wasn’t difficult for Ves, especially with his level of Spirituality.
As for choosing which design he wanted to adapt, he considered choosing his own designs such as the Blackbeak or the Crystal Lord, but eventually rejected those choices because they weren’t associated with the Flagrant Vandals.
Only the Inheritor light skirmisher and the Hellcat hybrid knight deserved to be used. Of the two, Ves was heavily partial towards the Inheritor, but its status as a cheap, disposable mech to the Vandals could be seen as disrespectful to the recipient. He didn’t want to give Iris the wrong impression.
The Hellcat was much more appropriate to be adapted because the spaceborn design enjoyed a very high status with the Vandals. The mech’s archetype also allowed Ves to incorporate the lessons he learned from working with other hybrid knights designs such as the Caesar Augustus and the Marc Antony.
The only complication he faced was when he tried to create a miniature flight system. Ves had been forced to fudge a lot of things in order to get it to work without shooting the miniature into the ceiling.
"If you connect the miniature with your comm, you can control it from there. Try out its flight system."
Iris followed his instructions and keyed the miniature Hellcat to her comm. Like operating a toy, she activated the mech and made it over their table. She laughed as she played with the little mech.
"I haven’t played with dolls since I was a kid!"
Several minutes later, Iris had her fill and switched the little mech off. She carefully put the machine back into the gift box it came with before setting it aside.
"So how is my gift?"
"It’s more than I expected, Ves. It’s surprisingly symbolic, in a way. I’m sorry to say that I haven’t prepared a gift of my own for you."
"That’s okay."
"No, I insist. Since you’ve given me such a personal gift, I won’t feel easy until I pass you something of my own."
"Take your time with it, Iris. There’s still time before we enter the Reinald Republic."
She nodded at that. "It’s true that I’ll have to say goodbye to you and the Vandals when we get there. The VRF still needs me back home, and I can’t forsake my family. Don’t worry though, I’m pretty sure we’ll meet again."
"Why is that?"
"It’s. A. Seeecret." She replied with a wink.
At first, Ves thought she only said that in a perfunctory manner, but evidently she knew something that he didn’t. Would they truly see each other again someday?
Perhaps after a couple of decades or so. Ves threw his speculation to the back of his mind.
"It’s getting late. Let’s retire for the night."
The pair wished each other goodnight and returned to their separate cabins. Ves sighed as he changed his clothes and slipped into his bunk. He almost couldn’t believe their escape from Vesian space had reached the endpoint. The border to the Reinald Republic was only a stellar stone’s throw away.
He wondered what would happen next once they reached another foreign state. Reinald was a very different locale from the Bright Republic. Whereas his home state was a little boring, the Reinald Republic was full of life and excitement.
"At least, that’s what all the promotions are saying."
The Reinald Republic was known as one of the liveliest states in the Frozen Leaf Alliance. Though the state wasn’t very large or endowed with an abundant amount of exotics, it had become a nexus of sorts of different foreign influences.
As a small state, the Reinald Republic actively courted other states. Besides the neighboring Vesia Kingdom, Reinald managed to forge diplomatic and commercial bonds with almost every other third-rate state in the star sector.
Their location wasn’t very central. In fact, it was actually a little troublesome to reach Reinald because there weren’t any port systems in the vicinity.
To some people, this was an advantage. The Reinald Republic played host to many ventures of dubious legality. Thieves and gangs mingled with suspected pirates in Reinald’s extensive grey and black markets. Whenever someone needed to get their hands on something dirty, they took a trip to Reinald.
For some reason, the MTA hadn’t cracked down on all of the shady dealings that took place there. Some believed that the MTA tacitly contented to such trades as long as it wasn’t too excessive. If the MTA decided to stomp on Reinald’s illegal markets, the problem would only go somewhere else. In the thousands of years since humanity expanded into space, crime and piracy always accompanied their rise.
"Even the MTA can’t do everything."
The tense negotiation finally came to a conclusion. Although the terms were incredibly detailed and abstruse, the basic layout of the agreement sounded simple enough.
First, the Flagrant Vandals officially handed their custody over Venerable Foster to Peace for Hafner. In return, the Flagrant Vandals received a large amount of wealth and resources as well as undisclosed benefits in the Reinald Republic.
The former two quenched the severe shortages that crippled the Vandals from restoring their battle strength. The Vesian rebel group generously paid the Vandals a fortune in Reinaldan marks. Even though two marks was only worth one bright credit, the Vandals still received a considerable sum, though no one leaked out the exact figure.
As for the latter, no one questioned why Peace for Hafner was able to accomplish this promise. While the Reinald Republic opened its doors to every foreigner, that didn’t mean they enjoyed a level playing field.
Native Reinaldans withheld many privileges that foreigners needed to work for in order to enjoy them. These privileges included lower tariffs, less onerous taxes, fewer import and export restrictions, lower waiting times, residency permits and so on.
According to Iris, while Reinald famously levied low tax rates, they were famous for nickeling and diming numerous conceivable charges. If any Reinaldan thought they could charge a fee for something, they would assuredly set a price for it. Most of the more ridiculous charges only applied to foreigners of course. This gave first-time visitors a huge shock once they found their bank accounts empty.
"Still, the Flagrant Vandals still got shafted."
The Vandals needed to repay the generosity provided by Peace for Hafner. Their preparations, intelligence gathering and acts of sabotage all contributed to the capture of Venerable Foster. Even though the Vandals suffered a disproportionate amount of losses, they had been pressured into giving up more meat to the sock puppet rebel group.
Peace for Hafner undoubtedly gained the most out of this trade. Their investment was fairly minimal, all considered. All of the subversive actions they performed during this operation had already been laid out far in advance. It took time to get the right people in the right positions. Besides a handful of highly placed spies, most of their agents were disposable.
Thus, through a minor effort, they reaped a huge reward. An extremely talent expert pilot in the form of Venerable Foster was worth at least twice as a fully mature expert pilot. Her potential and growth rate was astounding, so much so that everyone at the negotiation table regarded her as a potential ace candidate.
Once Peace for Hafner had taken over custody of the expert pilot, they hashed out a second agreement with the Hafner Duchy in turn. Although it would have been better in the long run for them to kill or keep Venerable Foster captive, they couldn’t resist the enticement of rich rewards.
They already provided a lot of compensation to the Flagrant Vandals. If they didn’t make up for their losses, they wouldn’t be able to call themselves proper Reinaldans- ahem, Hafners.
The Vandals didn’t get to hear the exact details of their agreement, but Ves could imagine that the Hafner Duchy bled a pretty penny. However, Ves also admired the farsightedness of the Duke of Hafner who currently suffered a lot of reproach from the rest of the Kingdom.
The value of a future ace candidate was immeasurably high, but that was only a faint possibility at best. For Hafner to grit their teeth and submit to naked extortion from a rebel group that had long been a thorn in their side, their foresight was very great!
Fortunately, this didn’t concern the Vandals very much. The Hafner Duchy was situated on the wrong side of the Kingdom. If Venerable Foster ever became a scourge, she would definitely vent her fury on Reinald’s proxy forces first. As for the Vandals, they were just a bunch of small fries in the greater scheme of things.
The Vandals kept their heads down throughout the final leg of their journey. After making use of the free passage offered by the Hafner Duchy, they met up with ships affiliated with Peace for Hafner and physically transferred over their prize. In return, the Vandal ships loaded up their cargo holds with lots of critical materials.
One more important event took place at that time. The Vesian Revolutionary Front recalled their liaison. An unremarkable corvette arrived in the star system within Reinald’s borders and parked next to the Shield of Hispania.
Down at the combat carrier’s hangar bay, Iris stood beside a shuttle. A pair of luggage coffers floated behind her, though she still held on to the gift box that contained a miniature mech.
"I can’t believe I lived through all of the excitement." She sighed as she recalled what they went through. "It’s a wonder the Flagrant Vandals managed to stay alive after surviving all of those battles."
Ves had accompanied her down the hangar bay. He shook his head when he heard her words.
"This is a one-off occasion for the Vandals. I don’t think they’ll pop up in the news after this. Every serviceman is tired to the bone. I hope Major Verle cuts his men some slack after we arrive at our final destination. Everyone is looking forward to spending some time on Reinald’s famous pleasure planets to recuperate."
Reinald profiled itself as a dangerous but alluring state. The people that tended to visit the little Republic longed to experience some excitement in their lives. Through visiting the same planets frequented by pirates, dark mercenaries and gang members, they gained the opportunity to sample a life where someone might get rich overnight, only to receive a laser beam through their heads the next day.
Remarkably, many tourists departed from the little Republic with their hides intact. The same could not be said for their bank accounts, but when it came to personal safety, Reinald was surprisingly strict in performing their due diligence. Income from tourism was one of the legs that supported the scrappy little state.
Iris directed her luggage coffers to float inside the shuttle and secure themselves onto a rack. She then turned back to Ves. "I hope you enjoy your time in Reinald. Remember not to fall into a debt trap. You don’t want to know what happens when you run out of money in Reinald space."
"What about you? Where will you be going?"
"I’m heading back to Vesian space, though the corvette I’ll be boarding won’t be crossing into Hafner. Their troops are still on high alert, you see."
"Understandable. Have a safe journey, then!"
"You too!"
Ves waved her shuttle goodbye as it lifted up from the deck. The stubby vehicle zipped through the energy screen that shielded the ship’s interior from the ravages of space.
"I wonder what is next in store for the Vandals."
The next days, Ves busied himself with sorting out the abundant amount of materials provided by the rebels. The mech technicians already started repairing some of their more heavily damaged with the help of newly-fabricated parts.
In the meantime, every serviceman started looking forward to some much-needed shore leave.
Reinald’s openness to foreigners allowed the battered and limping Verle Task Force to relax. For the first time in two harrowing months, they didn’t have to scurry like rats in the forgotten corners of the galaxy. They could openly navigate towards brighter stars that was easier to reach via FTL. Instead of making multiple short hops, their FTL drives could traverse the same distance in a single larger jump.
"Thank the heavens!" An engineer cried out in relief one day at the mess hall. "Our FTL drives are awfully worn out. Compressing so many hops in a short amount of time will do our drives no good. Every ship needs some time in the yard, but our logistics ships are in an especially critical state."
The Beggar’s Bounty and the Linever Swan both relied on jury-rigged FTL drives specced for a different class of starships. Though the chief engineers managed to keep the logistics ships together, their incompatible FTL drives were endless sources of trouble. Each time the two fat ships emerged out of FTL, the task force was forced to endure several hours of delay on top of the ordinary FTL drive cycle time.
Therefore, Ves had a strong guess that the Vandals should be charting a course towards one of Reinald’s major star systems. Only a highly developed star system with plentiful ship and repair yards would be able to satisfy their material demands.
"I wonder what will happen next."
Many of the Vandals didn’t think about it, but Ves hadn’t forgotten that reaching the Reinald Republic wasn’t their end goal. Their true mission began once they reached a particular destination within the Reinald Republic. Ves guessed that whatever was about to happen should take place at their next port of call.
His office appeared much emptier after Iris had left. As Ves quietly allocated different portions of materials, he missed the opportunity to discuss his work with another mech designer.
"A second opinion really helps. Now that my only assistant has left, there’s nothing there for me to bounce my ideas."
Ves scratched his head and considered taking on another assistance. If the task force wasn’t dissolved after the end of this journey, then he would consider the matter seriously.
"It’s too bad I’m not very close to the other mech designers."
Iris provided an ideal foil to him because she was knowledgeable yet also an outsider. She could provide honest advice to him while avoiding any conflicts of interest.
"Mr. Vedette is too junior to provide much help for me. His studies are still too far behind. Pierce is more capable in that regard, but he’s the only person I can trust to keep watch over the Beggar’s Bounty."
As for everyone else, Ves didn’t even consider them. They either lacked the qualifications or didn’t engender a lot of trust.
For now, Ves had to make do by himself. It was fortunate that he was already used to working alone, so the solitude hardly impacted his productivity.
He still reminded himself to stop relying on himself all the time when he went back to running his own business. While working with no one else allowed him to maintain his many secrets, once the scope of his business grew bigger, he couldn’t shoulder everything by himself any longer.
A few days later, the Verle Task Force finally arrived in a highly-populated star system. The Harkensen System was a prominent trade nexus of the Reinald Republic. It appealed openly to outfits and provided many services useful to them. Anyone with enough money could procure enough starships and mechs to conquer another planet.
They key word here was money.
Without money, you couldn’t even buy the cheapest nutrient pack in Reinald! The Republic was never one for charity. The Harkensen System was a little more rowdy than most due to the prevalence of mech pilots that visited its planets.
The Harkensen System wasn’t a port system and didn’t feature any remarkable mineral deposits. What it had instead was three promising terrestrial planets, all of which had been terraformed for human habitation. Each planet offered something good.
Harkensen I was a tourist destination. The slightly hot planet featured fantastic natural sceneries and splendid beaches. Many mech pilots that have gone through a frigid campaign flocked to Harkensen I to unwind. The planet offered many pleasures and various forms of entertainment to those who brought money.
Harkensen II didn’t offer much to foreigners. It was the seat of the local government as well as the primary habitation planet for local citizens. A lot of Reinaldans lived on the planet, and only the most esteemed foreigners received the right to reside on this planet.
Harkensen III lacked most of the fun that could be found on Harkensen I, but it was the planet where the bulk of the trade was being conducted. It featured extensive market places, trading halls and more. Many shipyards orbited the planet, providing many services to various fleets or those who sought to commission a ship.
The Verle Task Force made a beeline towards Harkensen III.
When Ves first received an introduction of the Harkensen System, he felt some deja-vu. In his eyes, the Harkensen System was the poor man’s version of the Bright Republic’s Bentheim Region.
"Harkensen III is a pale copy of Bentheim. Harkensen II is like Rittersberg but a bit less snobby. Harkensen I is like Moira’s Paradise but without the aquatic culture."
Still, copies or not, each of the planets provided something different to the star system. Having them concentrated in a single star system provided enormous conveniences to visitors, especially the bigger ones that brought a whole fleet.
Ves wouldn’t be able to see the thousands of ships that flew back and forth from the viewports, but he easily called up a chart that showed how many vessels were present in the Harkensen System.
The chart depicted thousands of dots, each of which represented a fully capable starship. Many of them were in transit. They either transitioned at the edge of the system and burned their way to the interior, or finished their business at one of the planets and burned towards one of the many highly congested Lagrange points.
One indicator of success to a star system was to see whether congestion took place at their Lagrange points. Considering that the ships needed to wait up to an hour for them to get their turn, Harkensen’s success only paled in comparison to Bentheim.
"This is truly a melting pot of different origins."
Ves casually read through the registries of the ships present in the system. Only a portion hailed from Reinald. Many came from other third-rate states such as the Roppo Principality or the Council Stars of Lisz.
He even spotted lots of trade ships bearing the flag of the Bright Republic! They mostly traveled in convoys escorted by foreign mercenary corps.
A significantly greater amount of Vesian trading vessels flew back and forth as well. It couldn’t be helped as the Reinald Republic was a direct neighbor of the Vesia Kingdom. Even though relations between the two states were rather frosty, that didn’t hinder the pursuit of benefits among their trading conglomerates.
"Earn money first! What? Pirates? Who are you calling pirates?! I’m an honest Reinaldan, I swear to my mother and grandmother! Hey, I’ve got a great deal for you! This five percent discount is yours!"
Although the Vesians and Brighters waged a very intense war against each other, the ships that hailed from the two wartorn states behaved especially discrete.
Neither side attempted to bump into each other, not that their cargo ships could deal a lot of damage in the first place. Reinald’s traffic managers also paid a lot of attention to every ship’s origin. They did their best to separate ships from rival states from each other and forced them to adhere to separate routes.
The Verle Task Force received a lot of attention from the Honored Ones, which was Reinald’s mech military. Every unit of the Honored Ones bore an emblem that consisted of a silhouette of ancient viking warriors.
Just after the Vandals arrived, a patrol squadron flew alongside the Vandals and transferred over a bunch of inspectors. Every mech aboard every Vandal ship needed to be sealed. Ves had already arranged the mech technicians to seal the mechs beforehand, so the inspectors found very few problems.
Of course, people always slipped up. Some of the seals put on damaged mechs didn’t look very proper. These mechs could still inflict a lot of damage at their current state, so the mech technicians worked overtime to fix their mistakes.
"With the problem cases taken care of, I don’t see any further problems, Mr. Larkinson." An Honored One bearing the uniform of an inspector spoke. His accent bore the clipped and harsh tones of a typical Reinaldan accent.
"I’m glad our condition finally meets your approval." Ves replied as they both arrived at the airlock in one of the corridors of the Shield of Hispania. "We’re all looking forward to entering the Harkensen System."
"You certainly deserve it! I’ve eagerly followed mech regiment’s exploits. You Vandals sure gave the Vesians a good thrashing."
"It wasn’t without cost."
"We understand." The inspector nodded with a smile. "The Harkensen System is always open to warriors with honor such as the Flagrant Vandals. Our berths are already reserved for the arrival of your ships. I understand that many deals are in the works. I hope your mech regiment enjoys doing business here!"
Ves scratched his head once he saw the inspector off. From the information he received from men aboard the other ships, the Reinaldans only exerted their efforts on detecting weapons of mass destruction and making sure the mechs bore the proper seals. Their inspectors barely paid attention to anything else, including other threats or contraband.
Their conduct carried an implicit message. Any visitors could bring as much shady stuff as they wanted, as long as they made an effort into keeping their contraband out of sight.
Ves had no doubt that at least a quarter of the ships paying a visit to the Harkensen System sought to offload their contraband to the grey or black markets. Frankly speaking, the Harkensen System appealed more upright outfits that largely worked within the boundaries of the law. Their grey market was far more prominent than their black market.
"If you want to see the really bad stuff, you should visit the Mulendrone System instead." Iris once told him. "That place is a cesspool of humanity. There’s no greater black market in the neighborhood than the one in Mulendrone. Everyone there is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. If the pirates don’t make such a good effort to disguise themselves, the MTA would have imploded Mulendrone’s star by now."
Fortunately, the Flagrant Vandals carried the official sanction of the Mech Corps. Despite the lukewarm support they received from headquarters, the Vandals didn’t have to suffer the ignomies of being branded as outlaws.
Now that the Vandals finally entered neutral space, it was hard for them to shake off the habit to regard everything outside with hostility. Many servicemen had been so inured in war that they found it difficult to adjust to a neutral star system.
At the next conference meeting, Major Verle explained their upcoming plans.
"We will be spending up to four weeks in the Harkensen System. This won’t be enough time for us to restore our full strength, but we’re down almost five-hundred mech pilots, so it won’t help us if we have more mechs than we can make use of. From what the repair yards we’ve contracted have promised, four weeks is enough to restore the FTL drives of our logistics ships."
Both their landbound and spaceborn contingents endured heavy damage in the previous journey. Though the Vandals finally made it out alive, they permanently lost almost half of their precious mech pilots.
These were Brighters who trained from ten years old to pilot a mech. After graduating, they entered into the Mech Corps and underwent another round of intensive training before they were assigned to their mech regiments. Although the Flagrant Vandals might not have been very prestigious, their training standards wasn’t too far off from the premier mech regiments.
Each mech pilot admitted into the Mech Corps was a treasure. Those with poor skills, insufficient aptitude or attitude problems would be rejected right out of hand during normal times. Everyone who made it through the initial inspection possessed the right qualities to become a soldier.
These people weren’t as common as everyone thought. Many potentates failed to live up to their promise and could only find a piloting job in the private sector. Those who had what it took to join the military belonged to a privileged class that wasn’t easy replaced.
The shortage of qualified mech pilots pained the Vandals who attended the meeting. It was impossible for them to refresh their ranks in Reinald space. They had to go all the way back to the Bright Republic to receive replenishment from the Mech Corps. Until then, they had to make do with half as much mech pilots.
Ves raised his hand. "Sir, how extensively do you want to restore our mechs? Do you wish to contract out their repair to the workshops on Harkensen III or do you want to keep it in-house?"
"At the end of our downtime, I want to see five-hundred pristine mechs." Major Verle grinned savagely at Ves. "It’s very important for us to pair each mech pilot with a mech that is ready for war. Since it’s unlikely we can accomplish this aboard our own ships while they are all under repair, we’ll have to resort to outside workshops to do the work."
"Are the Reinaldans principled enough to repair our mechs without fudging them in any way? To be honest, sir, everything I’ve heard about the Reinaldans makes me think that it’s better to keep everything under our control."
"You make a fair point, Mr. Larkinson, but we aren’t strangers to doing business with the Reinaldans. As with everything, whenever possible we should trust but verify. The workshops and shipyards that we are working with have already agreed to let Vandals observe their work. This is important as many components integrated within our ships and mechs are rather sensitive. We’ll let the Reinaldans take care of the less-important repair work while our own men will perform the critical repairs."
That sounded like a messy arrangement to Ves. "This is going to be difficult to arrange, sir. We’ll have to rent a secure workshop on the surface of Harkensen III to do all that work."
"Then it is a good thing you have a lot of experience in this area. Since you’ve founded a mech business before, setting up a temporary workshop won’t be any trouble."
Ves smiled thinly at Major Verle. "I will do my best, sir."
Major Verle turned to a more anticipated matter. "Let’s move on to shore leave. We’ll be adopting a rotating schedule for every Vandal. No one is excepted from this, not even you, Chief Avanaeon! Go have some fun on Harkensen I. I practically order it. Perhaps you will finally see how much renown we’ve gained in the greater galaxy."
Some other staffers stepped in to lay out a detailed schedule for shore leave. Everyone pretty much enjoyed a two-week period of downtime where they could do as they pleased.
Those who wanted to enjoy a pure vacation would doubtlessly flock to the entertainment paradise of Harkensen I. Every Vandal received a fixed salary in bright credits which they could easily convert into Reinaldan marks. With the bump in payments due to serving during wartime, no one should be short on money.
Those who couldn’t divorce themselves from mechs could hang around at the endless amount of mech pilot establishments on Harkensen III. The third planet from the sun also featured a robust mech duelling scene. Though only specialized and registered mech athletes were allowed to compete in the major mech arenas, the planet was notorious for hosting many underground fighting venues.
A Vandal mech pilot with a bone to itch would surely pay a visit there. Major Verle didn’t approve of these fights, but he could hardly control his own men. A couple of Vandals would doubtlessly chew off more than they could bite and lose their lives in the process.
"As far as possible, make sure that your men won’t get in trouble with the law. They can drink until their liver needs a regeneration treatment, they can pump their veins full of stimulants for all I care, but whatever they do, I better not hear any stories of a Vandal getting into a fight with Reinaldans!"
As guests of the Reinald Republic, the Flagrant Vandals needed to retain some scruples to their hosts. The tolerance of the Reinald Republic was fairly high when it came to scuffles between different groups of foreigners, but once a proper Reinaldan got hurt, the Honored Ones cracked down hard on the offenders.You can trace the roots of this content at n0v@lbin
One of the major concerns for letting the Vandals loose for some shore leave was that anything could happen to them. For example, someone might attempt to kidnap in order to beat some intelligence out of their mouths. Some drunk Vesians might bump into some drunk Vandals and come to blows with each other. Some Vandals might even be bribed into becoming a spy or a turncoat.
All manner of dangerous outcomes may become possible if the Vandals enjoyed free reign in the Harkensen System.
This wasn’t the first time they were being let loose in a neutral star system. They also knew how to be discreet during times of war. However, the combination of both resulted in a potentially calamitous situation.
Major Verle announced some precautions to mitigate the danger. "To prevent any untoward incidents, everyone will form groups of ten. Nobody is allowed to wander off by themselves. Even if you go to the restroom, at least one other Vandal should be close at hand. Their comms will make sure that everyone abides by these restrictions. The moment someone goes missing or wanders out of range, every comm will send out an alert to the men and our internal network."
This placated those who looked as if they objected to exposing their men to various risks. While these measures didn’t plug all the loopholes, they at least made it a lot harder for anyone with nefarious intentions to project designs on the Vandals. They not only need to take care of ten Vandals in unison, but they also needed to hack or jam the comms at the same time, all the while preventing bystanders from getting the word out.
As long as the groups of Vandals lingered in public areas, they wouldn’t be exposed to too much risk. Ves knew that much of their confidence lay in their military-issued comms, which contained a lot of strong capabilities.
Usually, the servicemen could only access a couple of core functions on their comm. Features such as browsing the galactic net, taking notes, sending messages to someone or even playing some games would be locked behind a stringent set of rules. Unless someone reached a higher rank or received permission from a senior officer, they wouldn’t be able to get up to mischief with their comms.
This mistakenly gave the Vandals the impression that they wore the cheapest and most basic model of comms.
The truth was very different. Ves estimated the cost of the comms to be at least five-hundred times more expensive than a standard civilian comm model. The Vandals fabricated the comms in-house, so Ves based this valuation from the expensive materials and trace amounts of exotics incorporated in the wrist devices.
Paired with exclusive software, these comms resisted jamming and intrusion much more effectively than any civilian comm model. In addition, their networking range reached across an entire city as long as they received a little assistance. Any attempts to pervert them would require a supreme hacker or a large-scale effort that couldn’t be hidden.
The military comms doubtlessly possessed a lot more functions than that, but Ves didn’t have the qualifications to know anything more. Information about the comms and any other restricted technology used by the Vandals was only available on a need-to-know basis.
"There will be Vandals who will wish to wander off regardless." A mech officer said. "I know the lads. Some will want to sneak off to the underground arenas. Others crave more extreme pleasures."
"They can do what they want, but only if all ten of them go. If someone wants to take a risk, either they rope their entire group, or nobody goes. As soon as someone separates from the group, the rest of the group will be penalized and have their shore leave cancelled immediately. As for the wayward Vandal, we’ll send out a batch of security officers to haul him back and throw him into the brig."
Very practically, Major Verle mentioned nothing about visiting the less-than-legal establishments in the Harkensen System. Considering that most tourists visited the Harkensen System to enter these shady joints, the commanding officer could hardly prevent his men from following suit.
It was a good thing that the Reinaldans in the Harkensen System developed a reputation for safety. The honored ones maintained law and order in the light, while various Reinaldan cartels did the same in the dark. No Reinaldan wanted to upset the apple cart.
The rest of the meeting devolved into assigning different tasks to everyone. Even though every serviceman enjoyed a two-week vacation, the entire personnel roll would only get to enjoy it on a rotating basis. This meant that at least half of the Vandals remained at their disposal.
"Captain Rakeshir, I’d like you to do the usual and supervise the repair and refit process of our ships."
"Consider it done, major." The ship captain saluted. "However, four weeks isn’t enough time to complete all the repairs. We need to set some priorities."
"Focus on the basics first, captain. Increase the reliability of our ships. They need to be ready to keep going for at least a year without requiring another stint in the drydocks."
"Understood, sir."
The current duty of the ship officers was to babysit the ships while they underwent repairs. Many of the combat carriers sustained an extensive amount of surface damage, so their entire shells needed renewing. The two logistics ships urgently required new FTL drives as well.
All of this work needed to be done in conjunction with the repair yards orbiting Harkensen III that offered their services to anyone that paid. Of course, the Vandals could just hand over the ships to the repair yards and call it a day, but letting Reinaldans crawl over their ships without supervision was a recipe for disaster.
Even if the shipwrights behaved honestly, someone might still attempt to sabotage the ship or cut some corners. The worst outcomes would be to derive the exact blueprint or embed spying devices deep within the structure of the ships.
A Vandal needed to be present every step of the way. They also had to undertake the tasks that outsiders shouldn’t meddle with. This required lots of manpower, so even if half of the personnel roll didn’t get to enjoy their vacations, they shouldn’t be short of work.
Ves already received his own duties earlier. He would be responsible for managing the mechs, much of which required extensive repairs and refit as well. He couldn’t do this alone, so he received permission to call up as much mech technicians as he required.
As for the mech officers, they would be responsible for supervising the mech pilots as they underwent a special training. Harkensen III offered many different training programs that focused on developing very specific combat skills. These training programs mostly accommodated private outfits, but the more prestigious training institutes also offered various regimental training programs.
Peace for Hafner provided a free pass to these training programs for the entire mech regiment as a concession to the Vandals.
All in all, despite handing over their ships and mechs to the Reinaldans, the Vandals wouldn’t go idle. Too much work needed to be done, but for what?
As the meeting ended and everyone went their separate ways, Ves mulled over why the Vandals chose to undertake such an extensive refit in the Harkensen System.
"Four weeks is too short to restore everything up to full strength, but it’s way too long for critical repairs."
If the Vandals wanted to fix up their ships in a jiffy, two weeks would be enough to make the Beggar’s Bounty and the Linever Swan space worthy again. As long as the pair of logistics ships became safe enough to undergo a long journey, the Vandal fleet could easily travel back home by following a huge detour around Vesian space.
Yet for some reason the Vandals planned something else. Ves started to guess that the Vandals might not be going home anytime soon.
Four weeks devoted to restoring the combat capability of the task force meant that they would be ready for another operation immediately after. While there was no way the Vandals could supplement five-hundred mech pilots all of a sudden, their current strength was still sufficient to perform some missions that required less mechs.
Ves strongly believed the Vandals ran other plans. He hadn’t forgotten about Lord Javier and his unannounced captivity on the Shield of Hispania. There was no way that Javier would stay aboard the combat carrier when she entered a repair yard.
"Perhaps bringing him to the Harkensen System is the entire point of the journey."
The Harkensen System provided lots of services. All sorts of influences congregated here as well. While the Reinaldan cartels held sway over Harkensen’s underground, many other gangs maintained a small presence in their markets.
He could guess all day for the reasons why Lord Javier needed to be brought to the Harkensen System. Ves obviously wasn’t included among the innermost circle. He didn’t even know who was privy to the truth, though Major Verle and Captain Rakeshir would definitely be among their ranks.
Perhaps their stay in the Harkensen System might not go quietly at all. Lord Javier was not a regular noble and obviously knew some very important secrets.
"I’ll have to take precautions."
First, he returned to lonely office. Right now, he needed to plan for the repair and refit of around five-hundred mechs. Ideally, Ves wanted to squeeze in at least a hundred more mechs in order to increase their stockpile of spares.
"Not all mech pilots die on the battlefield. Many of them are able to eject in time. If we don’t have any spares at hand, those mech pilots won’t be able to reenter the battle."
During longer engagements, extra spares increased the staying power of the Vandals. In addition, spares enabled the Vandals to maintain their combat strength even after suffering a substantial amount of damage. The Vandals would be able to rotate their mechs as they got damaged and repair them while the mech pilots made do with spares.
Before, the Vandals hadn’t been able to build up any spares. Mechs constantly got damaged and mech pilots would inevitably be benched when there weren’t enough mechs to go around. Ves didn’t want to see such kinds of waste, so he planned on restoring at least six-hundred mechs within four weeks.
"This is an ambitious plan, but with so much power at my disposal, I don’t believe I can’t meet my target."
The important point about this task was that Major Verle gave Ves a lot of leeway on how to go about it. He could partner up with the same mech companies that the Vandals had contracted before, or he could shop around and find better alternatives.
Ves grinned at the thought. He had founded his own mech business and grew it from a one-man operation into a multi-billion credit corporation. Although he passed over much of the administrative burden to the retainers sent by the Larkinson Family, that didn’t mean he remained blind the to the vagaries of the mech industry.
"There won’t be any rip-offs on my watch."
He knew the business from inside-out and could tell the scammers from the real deal. Having been warned by Iris on how unscrupulous Reinaldans could be when it came to business, Ves dug in deep in the list of mech companies they could partner with for this massive repair effort.
Red flags immediately showed up.
"Ugh. The original partners are no good."
The Flagrant Vandals evidently visited the Harkensen System a few times, though none of the visits happened recently. In fact, the last time a Vandal detachment entered this system was more than a decade ago.
They entrusted their mechs and ships to various companies with ties to the Bright Republic. This was a prudent choice, all considered, but the companies took advantage of this and charged a steep premium without delivering any material benefits.
They basically ripped off the Vandals in the open.
"This is no good." Ves shook his head. He had a lot of work in store if he wanted to make this awful situation right. "We shouldn’t have to pay a premium for reliable service."
If Ves had to describe the mech industry, he would equate it to a pyramid.
The massive trans-galactic corporations sat at the top. Their businesses spanned entire star sectors and copies of their supremely optimised mechs got sold by the trillions every day.
The next tier of companies consisted of trans-sector corporations. Their activities transcended the borders between star sectors, and they always took advantage of the different conditions of each star sector.
Further down the pyramid, there were the sector-wide, state-wide, system-wide and planet-based corporations. The lower their tiers, the more of them existed. Technically, the Living Mech Corporation could be counted as a sector-wide corporation, which gave his company a lot of prestige.
At the bottom-most tier, the MTA couldn’t even count how many independent mech workshops operated within all of human space. The base of the pyramid was doubtlessly incredibly wide.
Yet the top of the pyramid was rather fat as well. A lot of competition existed in each tier, and no single mech corporation held absolute sway over their markets unless a state had conferred a monopoly to them. All of this activity led to a very high level of friction.
Even with the MTA taking an active hand in regulating all of the mech businesses, their energy could only be spent on so many concerns. They shouldered a lot of responsibilities and generally didn’t bother with petty offenses. The association basically handed over responsibility of policing such matters to the local states.
Some states proved to be less diligent than others. Particularly in third-rate states, enforcement of all kinds of rules could be spotty or lax. This opened the door to all sorts of scummy business practices.
A basic way for a company to stiff a customer was to do a sub-par job. For example, instead of delivering a mech worth 40 million Reinaldan marks, they secretly cut some corners and delivered a mech that should actually be valued at 30 million marks instead.
Of course, any mech business that wanted to sell a first-hand mech that was fresh off the production line needed to send it to the MTA for certification. This provided some protection to consumers, but this limited activity didn’t cover the entire scope of the mech industry.
"Buying a first-hand mech is safe. Everything else is fraught with scams or rip offs."
If someone wanted to sell a second-hand mech, they could send it back to the MTA to certify it again for a fee.
Most didn’t want to pay for the fee or lacked the funds to cover the cost.
Cheapskates that wanted to have it all therefore tended to sell their second-hand mechs directly to buyers through various ways. Of course, without a stamp of approval from the MTA, buyers needed to rely on their own judgement to determine whether they bought the product they expected to receive.
Whiny stories about customers who thought they bought a thoroughbred only to receive mule was widespread on the galactic net. If Ves wanted to have a laugh, he could always visit the forums where scam victims vented their frustrations.
"The second-hand mech market is fraught with both risk and opportunity."
Sometimes, the seller screwed up. Either they needed to get rid of their mechs in a hurry, or they didn’t fully understand the value of the mechs they wanted to sell. Keen buyers could easily pick up a bargain if they watched the market closely. Some fallen mech designers even shifted their careers into full-time mech appraisers to speculate on second-hand mechs or advise other buyers into making a prudent purchase.
"The repair market is also surrounded with pitfalls."
Mechs suffered damage all the time. They were primarily built for battle, so it shouldn’t be any surprise for them to return in a less-than-pristine state. Mech technicians in the employ of smaller outfits only possessed the capacity to perform surface repairs. Anything deeper and more extensive required a full-fledged maintenance department or help from others.
Lots of mech repair businesses set up shop on each planet with a large concentration of mechs and mech pilots. One of the hallmarks of the repair industry was that it suffered from a rock-bottom reputation. Not only were they widely-known as scammers, the sector was also plagued by a lack of capability.
Those in charge of the repair work in these businesses mostly turned out to be retired chief technicians or failed mech designers. Neither of these two types of people possessed any remarkable capabilities compared to a successful mech designer such as Ves. Their prestige was low and their profit margins were even lower due to all of the competition.
The only reliable repair businesses only accepted fixed contracts from long-standing customers. Since the Vandals only visited the Harkensen System sporadically, they fell outside of their ideal customer base.
Ves shook his head and readied himself for a long research slog. "I’ll have to go dumpster diving."
He cast his sight on the larger businesses at first. Though they always charged more than their smaller counterparts, they at least had a reputation to uphold since their revenue was substantial and were responsible for employing thousands of mech technicians.
"The only problem is that their premium is too much."
Picking a larger company wasn’t necessarily a good deed. These companies ripped their customers off in more sophisticated ways. If a customer brought up any wrongdoing, the company could basically shrug them off without suffering any loss of business as long as it didn’t happen too often.
Many of these repair businesses also had deep ties to various organizations and influences, chief among them was the Reinaldan government. The risk of bumping into a spy or informer was too high for Ves to entrust them with fixing up the Vandal mechs. Even under supervision, there were too many ways for mech technicians to fudge a component or two.
"The smaller businesses aren’t any better either."
Two problems resulted from contracting the smaller companies.
First, they only possessed a limited capacity. As Ves wanted to completely restore at least six-hundred mechs, he would need to contract over a hundred workshops. This kind of sprawl was too burdensome to deal with, as each workshop only employed a few mech technicians each that could only do so much work at a time.
The second and more serious problem was that the smaller workshops largely remained small due to their lack of competitiveness. This mostly translated into lack of capability or incompetence.
None of the mech models that the Vandals worked with were simple. The designs of military-grade mechs incorporated lots of sophisticated components and systems that washed out novice mech designers shouldn’t be allowed to get in touch with. Although the smaller businesses often charged the lowest rates, in this case you really got what you paid for. Ves could likely get a better result if he entrusted the work to a monkey with a multitool.
In addition, their lack of business made them highly susceptible to bribes. Anyone that wanted to fudge the Vandal mechs could easily throw a bag of Reinaldan marks at these money-starved beggars. The bag didn’t even have to be too big to get a good result.
"This leaves me with the midrange repair businesses."
Overall, the mid-sized companies fell between the two extremes in terms of pricing and other criteria. Ves judged that most employed sufficiently competent mech technicians to perform competent repairs. Yet he also needed to maintain his vigilance around them. They might not be as shrewd as their larger counterparts, but having grown to such a scale gave them a good instinct of how far they could push the boundaries.
Picking the right companies involved a careful selection process where Ves had to dig through the details of each company within the right range. Harkensen III possessed quite a lively mech scene that wasn’t too worse off compared to Bentheim, so he had about a hundred companies to consider.
Rick’s Repairs, Lovo-Opto Mech Restoration, the Mech Fixers, Argulant Workshop, the names went on and on. Most of the official data only told an incomplete story to Ves. He had to dig deep in the galactic net to get a better picture of their business practices. He ruled out any company with a mountain of recent complaints, which happened to cut his list in half.
Ves then looked at the price quotes, and he cut off those who charged too much of a premium or those who had a habit of adding too many surcharges on their work. This cut his list in half yet again.
He then picked out five companies that delivered decent work while adhering to fairly competitive prices.
"This may not be the most optimal selection, but it will do."
The only thing he couldn’t investigate was their discretion. Perhaps one company was secretly a front for the Vesians, while another opened up their database to a Reinaldan intelligence agency. It was impossible for Ves to uncover these kinds of secrets from the galactic net.
"Paying a visit to each of the five repair businesses will take up too much time."
Considering that relatively few customers complained about the businesses he selected, Ves thought it would be sufficient if the Vandals supervised and participated in the repairs.
Ves straightened out the details in the next hours. He sorted out the mechs according to their type, their damage and the ease of repair. He then contacted each business and sounded them out. Some companies preferred to work with light mechs, while other companies didn’t allow any outsiders to interfere with their work.
"What a mess."
All of these complications made him want to tear his hair out. Ves had to go back to his list and select other companies to substitute for his initial selections that didn’t pan out.
His persistence eventually paid off. He came to a preliminary agreement with five companies that looked good to Ves. Once he determined there was a basis of cooperation with his final selection, he passed the details over to the logistics department to hash out the details.
"My work is done. Lieutenant Commander Soapstone should be able to negotiate some good deals with the parameters I’ve provided."
His job as a mech designer only extended to mechs. Issues concerning contracts, purchasing, financing and the like fell under the purview of the bean counters of the Vandals. At the very least, Ves expected them to be glad that his careful market research resulted in substantial savings.
"If the bean counters don’t drop the ball, they should achieve cost savings up to sixty percent."
This would bring the final cost of repairs down to a competitive sum. Ves leaned back against his chair and mentally patted himself on the back. Only a mech designer who entered the mech industry and engaged in many transactions in the private market could be so astute. The careerist mech designers in the Mech Corps were practically dummies in comparison.
"Careerists have their own strengths, but when it comes to the private market, even a Journeyman like Alloc doesn’t know any better."
His good mood evaporated after Alloc’s name popped up in his mind. The Journeyman Mech Designer still hadn’t showed up on any lists. Two months since the Detemen Operation, the Vesians hadn’t sent any indications that he was a prisoner of war.
After so much time without any news, Ves had to assume the worst. Though he held onto lots of impractical beliefs, he could be highly practical in other matters. He wasn’t the type to hope in vain.
Alloc’s status as missing in action appeared feebler and feebler as time went on. In his mind, Ves had already replaced his status with deceased.
Though the Vandals lost a lot of mech pilots recently, none of their deaths really mattered to Ves. Yet the loss of a single mech designer impacted him a lot. Though mech designers were technically noncombatants, the battlefield was far too cruel. It reminded him of the danger of serving with the Vandals.
Harkensen System looked peaceful at first glance. Yet Ves felt as if he had entered into another battlefield.
The repair businesses the Flagrant Vandals went to bed with all operated out of large workshops. As the Vandals started transporting their damaged mechs to the workshops, Ves constantly had to rotate in between the workshops to prevent the people there from screwing things up.
"Don’t let this mech lay on its back!"
"Where’s the weapons on this mech? It came here with a sword and shield, what do you mean they never arrived?!"
"Goddammit, we contracted you to fix these mechs up, not damage them even further due to rough handling!"
The level of service that each of the five repair businesses provided was worse than Ves had thought. Over the past several days, he realized he had still been a little too naive about the types of characters that operated these joints.
Ves had thought that the repair businesses would operate akin to the maintenance departments of the Flagrant Vandals or another regular mech regiment. At worst, the owners ran their businesses like the workshop of a mercenary corps.
In actual fact, sometimes Ves felt as if he returned among the ranks of Walter’s Whalers. The sheer level of idiocy and sloppiness truly astounded him. How could these repair businesses even stay afloat with this level of service?
"No wonder why most of them charge so much. It’s not just to rip off their customers, but also to compensate for the incredible amount of inefficiencies in their operations."
It wasn’t as if the owners liked to run a tighter ship, but the problem was that they didn’t know how. As head designer, Ves threw his weight around whenever he visited their workshops, and he often got to meet with them in person.
All of them appeared to be exactly as he expected, mech designers or chief technicians who lacked the competence to work for more prestigious organizations.
The most loathsome of the bunch was a former chief technician called Lester Tobruk. He bought up a bankrupt repair business on the cheap and somehow hadn’t managed to ruin it yet, though it hadn’t grown any further either.
The mech technicians that Mr. Tobruk employed all followed after their boss. They lacked the skills, discipline or temperament to get hired by the military or a private outfit. Even the worst gangs rejected these abject failures.
"The repair industry is the trash heap of the mech industry." He concluded. "This is where all the losers go when they can’t get any lower."
Hounding the incompetent employees whenever they misstepped was extremely frustrating and tiring for Ves. Eventually, he shifted over this responsibility to the other mech designers. Though they weren’t as eagle-eyed as Ves, they at least possessed the skills to spot something wrong in time.
Mech designers who used to work in the private sector caught on quickly enough. People like Pierce only needed a few guidelines to do an adequate job in supervising the repairmen and direct the Vandal mech technicians to lend a hand as well.
"This is kind of a sad thing to see." Pierce shook his head as he watched a repairmen clean up after spilling over a barrel of liquid coolant. "In the Friday Coalition, the lowest standard of mech technicians is the same as a mech technician from the Mech Corps. This is only the starting level, and it’s barely enough to work for a small-time gang in Coalition space."
Ves sighed. "Your Friday Coalition is larger and more prosperous than dozens of third-rate states. You guys have the luxury of training aspiring mech technicians to a higher standard. We don’t have the population and training methods to match your standards."
"The Coalition isn’t my home anymore. It’s wrong for you to call it my state."
"You still enjoy Coalition citizenship, do you not?"
"I’m only an average citizen of the Gauge Dynasty. If not for my father, my citizenship would have been revoked. The Gauge Dynasty is extremely strict on these kinds of matters. As the most powerful partner in the Coalition, too many people wish to be a part of them. An exile like me doesn’t deserve to be counted among the strong."
Hearing Pierce put himself down all the time really exasperated Ves. Unfortunately, he couldn’t think of a way to cheer up his colleague. This was because they measured their self-worth according to their capabilities. Even after he borrowed a couple of books from the central database, Pierce had only improved by a snail’s pace despite receiving a couple of free tutoring sessions.
From what Ves had observed, Pierce’s potential might not have been exceptional, but his learning ability was still within an average range. The only problem was that he competed against his brilliant siblings ever since he was born. The shadow they cast upon his mind had affected his mentality.
At least Pierce could perform his latest duty without problems. The same could not be said for some of the other mech designers. The careerists in particular had a tendency to overestimate the competency of the repairmen. They were too used to somewhat disciplined mech technicians that had gone through basic military training.
"Why are you bothering me with this duty? It’s pure babysitting, sir!" Mercator yelled at Ves. He didn’t even hold back his overall contempt at Ves and his current locale.
"You either do your job, or take responsibility if you don’t. The lives of our mech pilots depend on the condition of these mechs."
"These grease monkeys already signed a contract with us, sir. I don’t see the need to spend so much effort on supervising them. It’s redundant!"
"Well, the Vandals won’t be able to ask for refunds from the repair companies once our mechs start to blow up all of a sudden on the battlefield. Look, if you don’t care about the welfare of our mech pilots, then think about who will be held responsible."
This shut the other fellow up. Mercator couldn’t afford to have too many stains on his record if he wanted to climb up the ladder.
After sorting out the careerists, Ves took a step back and let the other mech designers be the main people on point. Though a lot of mistakes still occurred, everything went according to schedule. Planning everything out took a lot of effort from him. He meticulously distributed Vandal men and mechs to each of the repair businesses according to their specialities and shipped in the appropriate materials from the cargo holds of the Vandal ships or from the local market.
It was a good thing that Peace for Hafner rewarded the Vandals with a lot of Reinaldan marks. The Vandal logistics officers must have anticipated their need. Everything became easier in the Harkensen System once you threw some hard currency around.
The only thing that money couldn’t buy was an honest Reinaldan. Ves sighed. Negotiating for the first batches of materials had been especially arduous.
"What’s troubling your mind?" Chief Haine asked as she overlooked a large hall where up to half-a-dozen Vandal mechs were being stripped.
"I’m thinking about how much time and effort we’ve wasted on negotiating with the Reinaldans. If you don’t make a stand, they’ll walk right over you."
"That’s the Reinald Republic for you. This isn’t the first time I’ve been here. It’s a lovely place if you can ignore the ugliness that goes around. Take advantage of your shore leave and see what the Harkensen System has to offer. I guarantee you won’t be disappointed."
"I’m worried that everything will go to hell once I’m gone." Ves smiled sardonically. "Why are the higher ups insisting on granting us shore leave in a foreign state? There’s nowhere we can go that is truly safe, and don’t forget that the Vesia Kingdom is right next door."
The chief snorted. "Sounds kind of stupid now that you think about it, right? If you’ve been with the Vandals for a while, you’ll learn that we don’t do things so simple. Let me ask you this. How many servicemen did we bring to the Harkensen System?"
It took a lot of people to run a mech regiment. While the advantage of mechs to states was that it required a lot less logistical support to field them in battle, they still required lots of support personnel to take care of matters that mech pilots simply couldn’t. When Ves added up the mech technicians and ship officers that supported the mech pilots, he came to a very substantial figure.
"The Verle Task Force comprises over ten-thousand servicemen by my count."
"Close enough. Now, the way the higher ups staggered our leave periods, there’s always going to be half let out in the wild. So there’s going to be at least five-thousand little Vandals running around on Harkensen I or Harkensen III."
A light went off in his head. "I see! It’s actually a distraction! Just like when we split up the main fleet in the Detemen System. One element is a distraction while the other element is vital to completing the mission."
The Flagrant Vandals certainly loved to employ this strategy. Ves reminded himself about Lord Javier. Sneaking off a hot potato like a captured Vesian noble with massive secrets would be very hard to do in normal circumstances.
Ves silently narrowed his eyes as his thoughts went over the situation as he understood it. If Lord Javier was a regular prisoner, the Vandals wouldn’t have gone through the bother of stuffing him in a hidden compartment aboard the Shield of Hispania.
Obviously, taking custody of Lord Javier was not a trivial matter at all. The Vandals tried their best to suppress any news of who they kept in captivity. This basically meant that others desired Lord Javier or the secrets in his mind as well, and weren’t afraid to fight the Vandals if it meant they could get the valuable prisoner in their hands.
In such a dangerous circumstance, letting so many Vandals loose made a lot more sense. The collective movement of the Vandals was a giant smoke screen that obscured the real intentions of the higher ups!
"Do you think we’ll be easy to keep tabs on?" Chief Haine continued. "If you rule out the Reinaldan government, every other influence needs to be discreet and only possesses a limited amount of agents to perform covert actions. Wouldn’t they have a headache trying to find the right target to tackle?"
Ves mentally applauded such a devious plan. Although following around five-hundred groups of ten was a lot easier than tracking five-thousand individual Vandals, moving in groups also allowed the most critical group to bring Lord Javier to another destination in disguise. Besides, any group of ten wouldn’t be easy to deal with considering that most Vandals knew how to throw a punch.
One benefit the Vandals enjoyed was that they were allowed to carry limited small arms such as pistols out in the open. This was another concession received in reward for capturing and handing over Venerable Foster. Average tourists couldn’t even dream of obtaining this privilege.
Somehow, Ves suspected that the Vandals aimed for such an outcome from the start.
"The whole thing about capturing Venerable Foster is a sideshow."
They lost almost half of their landbound mech pilots to capture an expert pilot without their own expert lending a hand. This was a feat of near-legend. To outsiders, capturing an expert pilot while losing hundreds of average mech pilots was a definite win.
Yet the significance of this hard-fought victory was only a means to an end. This overly-transactional way of running things detested Ves somewhat. It was an approach that treated the lives of servicemen like chess pieces.
"Maybe that is what it takes for a leader. In order to complete the mission, you can’t afford to be soft-hearted. War assets such as mechs are meant to be spent on the battlefield. As long as the fighting nets you a greater return, the sacrifices are worth it in the end."
Ves branded this lesson in his heart. It was inevitable that he would wield his own influence someday. Perhaps he would have to weigh the same kind of decision as well.
Ves chose to take his shore leave in the final two weeks of their stopover in the Harkensen System. He wanted to spend the first two weeks into making sure the repair work stayed on track.
Dealing with slime balls like Lester Tubrok or keeping the Vandal mech designers and mech technicians alert was a lot of work. Without his intervention, the massive repair effort would have suffered massive delays. Forget about repairing six-hundred mechs on time. Fixing up just three-hundred mechs would have been a miracle.
His cognition of the repair industry grew by leaps and bounds as he shuttled through the various companies the Vandals had contracted. Once he became more familiar with their circumstances, he grew a little more understanding of their difficulties.
"Do you think it’s easy for us to work with thousands of different mech models on an annual basis? We get every shape and size of machines in our hands, all of them using a billion different parts!" Tobruk snapped at Ves one day. "The only person in the galaxy who can master so many different mechs is the Polymath! Don’t expect mortals like us to match that kind of versatility!"
Ves wasn’t fooled. The fat bastard simply put up an act in order to weasel his way out of another problem of their own making. "Your stance is fine if you’re running a maintenance department for a mech regiment or a private outfit, but you’re not. You are operating a repair business. I didn’t see you whine when you signed the contract. If our mech models are baffling your men so much, then you should have thought twice before accepting our demands."
Mr. Tubrok wiped the sweat off his brow. "Hehe, Mr. Larkinson, can’t you be more merciful to us? The troubles I’ve mentioned are truly affecting our work. Out of all the mech regiments that I’ve worked for, yours is one of the worst! Not only are all your mechs completely battered down to their internal frames, you also make use of too many different mech models! There’s no way for my men to learn the ins and outs of a mech model and apply a set routine on other copies!"
"We’re not asking you to perform the most difficult repair jobs. That’s reserved for our own mech technicians. If you can’t even do the simplest repairs, then It’s a wonder you’re still in business!"
"We can do better! If you would just transfer some extra funds to us, I know a few friends who can lend us some senior mech technicians!"
"We are not paying a single mark more than what the contract stipulates."
Conversations like this happened every day. Half of the time Ves met with the owners, he had to reject their efforts to squeeze more money out of the Vandals. Perhaps this was a deliberate Reinaldan custom of eliciting bribes, but Ves had enough confidence in the contracts to stick to his guns.
After two weeks of close supervision, the repair businesses learned that Ves was not an affable sucker. Whenever owners such as Mr. Tubrok did business with a military mech regiment, they were used to dealing with careerists with zero business acumen or military officers with access to a virtually unlimited budget.
If he Flagrant Vandals maintained a cordial relationship with the Mech Corps, then they would have accepted an inflated price quote without blinking a single eyelid. After all, they could push all of their expenses on to headquarters back on Rittersberg and have them pay the bills.
No wonder the repair businesses attempted to levy ridiculously high surcharges at the start. For example, they attempted to bill the Vandals five-hundred-thousand marks for a single cockpit seat replacement!
What a luxurious chair! And the repair business claimed the cost was justified because it used authentic leather from an alien creature!
Ves only needed to run his finger on the seat to know that the chair was covered with synthesized leather made out of cheap waste materials.
It took a week to stomp on such attempts, and another weak to teach the Vandals to watch out for these kinds of scams. The Reinaldans were truly imaginative in this area.
The worst incident by far left Ves angry for the entire day. This was because he caught the repairmen deliberately botching up a working mech! They even did so under the nose of an inattentive Vandal mech technician!
The culprits would have gotten away with it if Ves failed to recognize the deliberate marks of sabotage. The business owner had to let the repairmen involved in the incident go, and promised to be more diligent next time.
Days like this, Ves regretted getting into bed with the medium-sized repair businesses. He vastly preferred working with the larger businesses even if they charged a significant premium. At least they could be relied upon to deliver a satisfactory job.
"Is the repair industry truly so scummy or is the local business culture at fault?"
He believed that both played a part. Each reinforced the other, turning slightly scummy businesses into a scam factories.
It didn’t help that many of the outfits that did business with the repair businesses on Harkensen III came from elsewhere. The foreigners that stopped over in the Harkensen System for business rather than pleasure tended to operate in the grey area at best. They mainly arrived at Harkensen to dispose of their ill-gotten goods in one of their many shady markets.
Outfits like these weren’t use to high-quality service. Scummy business practices was a daily fact of life for them. This was the price they needed to pay for profiting from the shadow or the dark.
It all highlighted the fact that despite its legal veneer, the Harkensen System was actually a hive of scum and villainy.
"What a dangerously two-faced star system."
While he disliked dealing with these kinds of incidents, he couldn’t help but admire Harkensen’s overarching design. There was no doubt that the small and weak Reinald Republic derived a lot of revenue from both tourism and commerce involving mechs. This was probably one of the many ways in which the Harkensen System narrowed its disparity to genuine port systems such as Bentheim.
Fortunately for his sanity, besides rotating among the repair businesses, Ves also undertook other matters. The Vandals stopped over this star system for many other reasons than to repair their ships and mechs. They also appeared to be preparing for the next leg of their journey.
Inklings of a follow-up mission became clearer and clearer as Ves received assignments to help the logistics department procure more supplies. In particular, his help was needed whenever the planners wished to procure a batch of mech-specific goods.
The latest shopping run involved a set of very specific and very expensive components. The matter was of such import that Lieutenant Commander Soapstone took care of it in person this time.
"Mr. Larkinson." She greeted Ves as he stepped inside a rented Reinaldan shuttle. The vehicle quickly lifted off and sped towards one the cities on Harkensen III. She handed over a data pad to Ves. "Please look at these parameters. We are in need of specialist mech equipment that isn’t easy to obtain. I’ve scheduled a meeting with an equipment broker who can supply us with what we need, but I’ll need your advice on what to purchase."
Ves instantly frowned when he read through the document on the data pad. "You’re looking to buy... Vesian MFS gravitic backpack modules? And not the regular ones either, but the heavy-duty ones that can exert a massive amount of counter-gravity. This... this is not something you pick up from an average mech shop!"
The Reinald Republic sold plenty of backpack modules that fit the Vesian Modular Fitting Standard. A gravitic backpack module was basically a giant anti-grav generator outfitted onto the back of a landbound mech. Their anti-grav fields specifically worked to counteract strong gravity exerted onto the frames of the mechs.
In general, gravitic backpacks were rather troublesome to use because of their bulk and incredibly high energy usage. This was because the gravitic backpacks effectively lightened the weight exerted onto a mech.
This was vitally important for landbound mechs being deployed on giant terrestrial planets with massive amounts of gravities. If an ordinary mech stepped onto a super earth with two g’s or up, the mech was liable to crush its vulnerable internals as it walked.
How could a mech even begin to fight when it couldn’t even defeat a planet’s gravity?
Of course, people didn’t often fight on super earths. No state went through the trouble of terraforming them and establishing settlements on the surface. The only reason why anyone would fight on a super earth was if the place hid a lot of riches.
"A heavy-duty gravitic backpack module is not only fifty percent bulkier than the regular product, they also run out of energy extremely quickly. Going solely by their internal energy cells, they only last half an hour on a normal medium mech."
"We are aware of the drawbacks of heavy-duty gravitic backpacks, but we truly need them. They need to be rated to withstand up to five g’s in atmospheric conditions. The pressure they will have to endure is very substantial."
That made it worse. A super earth with an atmosphere basically pressed a mech from all sides. Still, this request that came out of the blue practically startled Ves. Why did the Vandals seek for specialist equipment that only the most extreme treasure hunting outfits bought?
The whirlwind that the Vandals involved themselves with became murkier and murkier in his mind. He didn’t dare speculate anymore because he lacked too much information to make an accurate judgement.
For now, all he needed to do was to focus on his current assignment.
"The set of criteria you’ve provided are hard to fulfill, but not impossible. The only problem is that it’s going to cost us a lot."
"No problem. This is one of the expenses that Peace for Hafner has agreed to reimburse."
That was another strange concession. The Vandals definitely didn’t decide to go to a super earth for no reason all of a sudden. Everything the Vandals planned to do appeared to be premeditated. Ves felt as if he had been caught in a very large net.
"These heavy-duty gravitic backpack modules don’t look bad. However, are you sure you want them? Piloting a mech with a gravitic backpack on a super earth introduces all kinds of weirdness to the mechs affected by this technology."
"We are certain of their need, Mr. Larkinson. I’m sure you are curious exactly why we would seek this specialist equipment, but I advise you to keep your questions to yourself. Major Verle will explain the full details when needed."
"How many are we looking to procure?"
"Enough to outfit all of our landbound mechs, and some spares besides. These backpacks break easily during combat. Let’s set the figure at four-hundred backpacks."
Ves widened his eyes when he heard that. The cost of a heavy-duty gravitic backpack wasn’t as much as a high-quality mech component, but purchasing four-hundred of them at once was a major transaction.
"Since you’re already asking for gravitic backpacks, are there any other novelties you want to get hold of? We might as well shop for other gear while we are there."
"We are going to need some high-quality transceiver towers and jammers rated for base defense."
"Those are easier to acquire, and they’re cheaper to boot." Ves nodded with a little less tension. "Anything else?"
"Heavy-duty hazard suits." Soapstone added. "If the gravitic backpack fails, we don’t want to see our mech pilots get crushed."
"If those backpacks fail during battle, the mech will practically become inoperative under such a terrifying amount of gravity. Cockpit ejection will likely fail as well. They won’t be able to fly very far under five times the gravity of old earth."
"Our budget is limited. We will have to make do with the favors we received and the liquid funds we have left."
Ves already started to groan. This sudden spending spree came completely out of the blue.
After wrangling with the repair businesses all day for the last two weeks, Ves felt as tired as the Vandal mech pilots who had gone through several successive battles. The mental strain he accumulated from dealing with numerous troublesome issues wore out his patience.
So by the time he finally got to enjoy his vacation, he grabbed it with both hands.
Ves entered the common room of one of the dormitories that the Vandals had recently rented out. Hundreds of Vandals gathered in the morning as they waited for their group mates get out of bed and finish their breakfast.
"Head designer! Over here!"
He turned and saw a young woman waving at him. Ves approached the circle of Vandals and beheld the men and women.
Every group consisted of a different mix of Vandals. There would never be a case where a group consisted entirely of mech pilots or ship specialists or the like. Whoever drafted up the lists deliberately shuffled everyone’s names around so that each group represented every aspect of the mech regiment.
Ves figured this must have been a method for the higher ups to increase everyone’s connection to the Flagrant Vandals and intensify their camaraderie. No one in the common room wore their uniforms. Besides their military-issued comms, nothing on their bodies marked them out as Vandals.
Almost no one in the Harkensen System wore their uniforms, especially if they were off-duty. Lots of people from different states and backgrounds mingled here. If someone wearing a Vesian uniform happened to walk past someone wearing a Brighter uniform on the streets, lots of brawls would certainly ensue.
Thus, for better or worse, no visitor advertised their origins in Harkensen. At best, they would only be able to tell each other’s origin through their accents when they spoke.
"Mr. Larkinson, right? I’ve seen you several times from afar! I can’t believe I’m standing next a genius!" The woman who called earlier chittered next to him.
"Just call me Ves. Right now, none of us are wearing our uniforms."
"Ah, I’m Ensign Tiss Kozik. I work as a junior engineer aboard the Antecedent."
Ves looked at Tiss with a bit more respect. The difficulty of becoming a ship engineer in this day and age was extremely high. For her to be a junior engineer at her age must mean she possessed a bit of promise. Why would someone like her be assigned to the Vandals?
"I see everyone is here." The burly voice of the biggest person in the group spoke. "Let me introduce myself. You may know me as Lieutenant Nolsen Feray. I serve aboard the Finmoth Regal in the ship security department. This means that I’m likely the most dangerous Vandal among our little gathering outside of a mech. Does anyone dispute this?"
A few mech pilot types looked liked they wanted to contest, but eventually they backed down. Though their status and combat prowess with a mech put them far ahead of Nolsen, they weren’t allowed to bring any mechs.
The Honored Ones strictly limited the permits that allowed mech pilots to pilot a mech in Harksensen. Without a valid permit, even local Reinaldans could forget about unsealing a mech and piloting them out in the open. The same regime existed in most major planets and star systems such as Bentheim.
If not, chaos and confusion would be rife as mechs began to slaughter each other on the dime. Most training concerning mech pilots emphasized aggression, so they would usually be quick to anger and quicker to fight. Letting these wild beasts fight with their fists was one thing, but when it came to mechs, an entire capital city might become ruined after a week of unrestrained dueling.
"Alright then." Nolsen let up on his ferocity and smiled. "Forget about your former ranks and positions. We are all fellow Vandals here. Besides keeping you out of danger, I don’t have any interest in bossing you around. I hope we can come to an agreement on which places to visit."
The group members quickly introduced each other before they argued where they wanted to go. Ves quietly noted everyone’s names and postings and noticed that besides Tiss and Nolsen, everyone else came from the enlisted ranks.
Due to the difference in ranks, this gave Ves and the other two a bit more say than the enlisted folk, though Nolsen did his best to balance each other’s requests.
"Alright, we are in agreement then? Spend one week in Harkensen III before spending another week in Harkensen I."
No one disagreed too much. Some of the Vandals favored spending time in Harkensen III, while others wanted to spend all of their time in Harksensen I. Yet most of them wanted to spend a bit of time in both, so in the end the middle ground won out.
Hashing out which places they wanted to visit was a lot more complicated. The entire group had to sit down on some benches in order to come to a consensus on a schedule they could all agree upon. This was far harder to accomplish and it took Nolsen’s considerable efforts to draft up a final schedule.
"Alright, on our first day, we’ll be visiting the shopping district of Black Belle City, the capital city on Harkensen III. I should remind you all that we won’t be able to bring back anything we purchase."
It was too easy to slip in some spy bug inside a gadget the Vandals brought back to their ships. In truth, most of the Vandals wanted to experience the varied shops in Black Belle City.
"In the morning, we’ll stroll through the shopping districts. In the afternoon, we’ll visit Black Belle City’s other sights. In the evening, we enter the city’s grey area."
Over half of the group members perked up when they thought about the grey area. This was where the questionably legal transactions took place. Though it wasn’t as shady as the black areas, it served as a good introduction to the Reinaldan underground.
"Alright, before we set off, let’s pick up our weapons."
All ten Vandals exited the common room from the back and entered a courtyard where a bunch of Vandal security officers distributed standard-issue pistols brought by the crateload from the armory.
Though the public security in the Harkensen System was high, so many people smuggled in weapons that the Honored Ones pretty much gave up on enforcing any small arms weapons ban. As long as people didn’t bring in anything big or destructive, the Honored Ones didn’t bother too much.
The only rule that armed visitors needed to take seriously was that they absolutely couldn’t kill an upright Reinaldan. Certainly, outsiders had the right to defend themselves, but only up to the point of incapacitating a Reinaldan. Only the shadiest Reinaldans didn’t enjoy this protection.
This also distinguished the grey areas and black areas.
"Alright Vandals, everyone pick your weapon!" A grey-haired bosun called. "You only get one and as much ammunition or batteries as you are willing to carry!"
Not every Vandal was a good shot, but they at least underwent basic training, enough not to shoot themselves with their own weapons. They confidently picked their preferred model of laser or ballistic pistols, each of which varied substantially in size, firepower, capacity and more.
Ves had never gone through much formal training in handling a gun, and despite his lengthy practice with the Amastendira, he never regarded himself as a good shot.
Someone like him typically picked a dinky little laser pistol like the one that Tiss had picked out. Their lack of recoil and straight beams made them a favorite among servicemen that didn’t specialize in combat.
He picked a ballistic pistol instead, and not the lightest one either. Instead, he picked up a medium-sized hand cannon and stroked it once before receiving a couple of magazines.
"Do you even know how to handle that weapon?" Nolsen asked while he looked at Ves with a dubious eye.
"My aim isn’t that great, but I won’t be blown away if that’s what you mean."
Ves demonstrated his confidence by stepping up to the shooting range that the Vandals had set up at the end of the courtyard. After he checked his weapon and keyed his identity to the operating system of his pistol, he took up a stance and fired at one of the targets.
"Well, looks like you’re not so clueless after all. As expected of a Larkinson."
Compared to a trained soldier, his accuracy was abysmal. Yet for a mech designer, Ves could confidently hit a target ten meters away, which was sufficient to deal with imminent threats.
The only reason he opted for a ballistic pistol over a laser one was because he already possessed the Amastendira. Picking up another laser pistol did little to enhance his capabilities.
Despite the unsophisticated nature of the pistol, it came with several useful functions. One of which was to lock it in place on his body without a body. Ves opened his coat and slid the weapon in an underarm position. Most Vandals opted to hide their weapons on their person as well, though Lieutenant Feray choose to strap it to his hip in the open.
"Alright, if you’re satisfied with your gear, let’s set off! There are aircars waiting outside for us to board!"
The Vandals rented out a significantly-sized complex in one of the major cities of Harkensen III to accommodate more than ten-thousand servicemen. Ves saw thousands of Vandals in uniform getting onto aircars that brought them to their temporary work assignments. Those without a uniform headed to other destinations.
The aircar they boarded was like a small bus and possessed enough room to fit all ten of them. After Nolsen passed on their destination to the aircar’s AI, the vehicle floated into the air and joined one of the many streams of traffic that criss-crossed the entire planet.
Tiss bounced around in her seat. "This is the first time I’ll visit a foreign market. How exciting! They say that you can find anything from the Komodo Star Sector in one of Harkensen’s many shopping districts."
"I would take that with a grain of salt." Ves said with a bit more calm. "The Harkensen System is far from the major shipping lines. It doesn’t have a lot of products from the second-rate states as well. You can find a greater variety of curiosities from the rest of the Komodo Star Sector in the Coalition or in places like Bentheim."
"Bentheim is boring. There’s too many people there, and it’s all about mechs."
Ves couldn’t refute that. "That’s true. Still, each trading nexus has their own charm. Treasure hunters often try to dispose their gains in Harkensen, so we may see something nice from alien space."
This was one of the reasons why Ves didn’t object too much to visiting the shopping districts. Though all the truly valuable frontier loot only showed up in the grey or black markets, the legal markets had the advantage of safety. No one was liable to shoot someone there for owning something shiny.
As their aircar slowed down and descended from above, Ves looked down at the picturesque black structures that made up the more affluent part of Black Belle City.
The aircar slipped onto one of the city’s many parking areas. As soon as the group members exited the vehicle, another group of tourists entered it and zipped away.
"Alright, stay together. The mech plaza is just ahead!"
The group walked to a market-like street where various street vendors showcased sealed mechs in various conditions. Though it was easier to order a mech from a specialised store or from the galactic net, the lively market atmosphere in the mech plaza fostered many impulse purchases from well-off visitors.
A loud Reinaldan-accented voice called out from the rest of the hawkers. "Mech pilots! Get the latest from the Bright Republic! Purchase the latest sensation that is stirring up the entire mech market!"
Ves touched Nolsen’s shoulders and gestured his head towards the hawker. The security officer understood and detoured the group towards the section where the seller of Brighter mechs set up shop.
As the group neared the stall where the hawker kept boasting about his Brighter mechs, Ves abruptly stuttered in his pace.
"Behold the highest quality premium rifleman mech! Gaze your eyes upon the magnificent gold label Crystal Lord! Imported straight from the Bright Republic, this version is a limited edition! Look at its condition! There’s hardly a scratch on this beauty! For 250 million marks, it’s yours!"
A Crystal Lord. A copy of his second original design. Here in Black Belle City.
Though Ves had always known that the Living Mech Corporation extended its tentacles to foreign markets, Ves did not expect to come across his own product here.
The reason why Ves put on a weird face right now was because of the presence of the supposed gold label Crystal Lord. The LMC’s gold label products held a great amount of prestige that Ves had painstakingly built up step by step.
Ves sold relatively few gold label mechs ever since he went into business. He only sold around ten or twenty of them at a time because each gold label came with a guarantee of quality. Each customer who purchased a gold label mech would have absolute confidence of getting their hands on a mech that had personally been hand-crafted by the founder and lead designer of the LMC.
In other words, such a collectible luxury product shouldn’t show up in some random mech plaza.
"250 million marks for this ultra-rare second-hand mech! It’s an absolute steal to get a mech of this quality at this price!"
The seller was right on one thing. The mech represented a steal. The only questionable point was the customer might not be the beneficiary of the transaction.
This was because Ves immediately sensed that the mech was dead to his spiritual sense. "This is impossible."
His Crystal Lord design came with an unprecedented B-grade X-Factor. Even the stupidest third-party manufacturer would be able to fabricate one of the Crystal Lord variants with a wisp of X-Factor.
However, this only applied when the third-party manufacturer reproduced the Crystal Lord according to an authentic design.
Ves knew that the different labels of the Crystal Lord mainly distinguished themselves by the quality of their center crystal. The gold label version not only hosted a crystal that was twice as large as the lesser labels, it had also undergone an exclusive activation process from a one-of-a-kind crystal cube.
The mech in front of him happened to possess all of the right contours and dimensions of a gold label Crystal Lord. Even the oversized center crystal appeared to be cut into the right dimensions.
"This is impossible!"
The mech had been polished up until its coating gleamed in the local sun. Visually, the Crystal Lord mech looked like the real deal. That characteristic frame with a keen emphasis on mobility while benefiting from a modest amount of compressed armor gave the mech a sense of agile threat.
The alien head devoid of humanoid features that instead contained lots of mysterious starry holes made the mech look strange and exotic.
The slimmed-down rifle locked with seals and placed in its arms looked exactly like the rifles he designed in person.
The only problem was that it was all counterfeit.
"It’s fake."
This mech was an unauthorized copy of the real deal. Due to the complete lack of spirituality, the mech was not only an illegal copy, it wasn’t even an accurate reproduction.
Ves stared at the center crystal and noticed that it lacked the spark that signified that it had gone through the activation process. That alone signified that the mech that the seller claimed to be a gold label Crystal Lord was lying out of his teeth.
"Designed by Ves Larkinson, a genius from the Bright Republic, this is your only opportunity to get your hands on his best mech model to date! Come, take a close look at the majesty of this super scarce gold label mech! 250 million marks and it’s yours!"
When the seller mentioned his name, Ves received a lot of stares by the group members. Intellectually, they knew his name and knew that he was a mech designer. However, they never came across any of his products. Even if they were curious, most Vandals lacked the permission to browse the galactic net.
"Is that yours, Ves?" Ensign Tiss asked with admiration in her eyes. "What a huge amount of money! 250 million marks is like 125 million bright credits!"
None of the Vandals remained calm when they thought about how much money the sums represented. It was as if it had never occurred to any of the Vandals that their head designer was a billionaire in civilian life.
Ves pressed his lips into a very thin smile. "That seller is a fraud."
He didn’t say anything about his wealth or identity. Instead, he stepped towards the seller’s stall.
"Uh, don’t start any trouble here! This is Harkensen, not Bentheim!"
Ves nodded to show he understood and walked up right in front of the extravagantly dressed Reinaldan. The hefty man looked like he couldn’t stuff enough gold ornaments on his body.
"Welcome, customer! Are you interested in my Hayfly?"
"Tell me about the Crystal Lord you’re selling." Ves spoke calmly. "Where did you get it from?"
"Ah, the Crystal Lord! Its tale is long and winding. You see, this mech is fabricated in secret by Mr. Larkinson to his homosexual paramore..."
"...who went ill from an alien sexually transmitted disease..."
"...had to sell his precious Crystal Lord which represents his secret engagement gift to fund his treatment..."
"...some pirates intercepted the convoy that shipped the Crystal Lord..."
"...the alien sandmen ambushed the pirates that got a hold of the Crystal Lord..."
"...a small fleet of treasure hunters beat the sandmen back and coincidentally salvaged some shipping containers, one of which contains this Crystal Lord..."
Ves held up his hand. "Alright alright, enough!"
"Oh, I was only half-way in my story, dear customer! The best part had yet to come!" The seller boasted with a grin.
Some of the group members giggled and laughed behind Ves, which only lowered his mood even further.
"Do you have any proof of authenticity for this mech?"
"Ah, sadly, if you listened to the rest of my story, you would have realized that all of the documentation has been lost. Alien insects infested the ships of the treasure hunters and tragically ate the data pad that contained the certificate of authenticity! I wouldn’t sell this precious mech for such a low price in the plaza if that was the case! The market price for any gold label Crystal Lord is undoubtedly than 500 million marks! I’m giving you half-price here! This is absolutely a great deal!"
"I don’t know." Ves crossed his arms. "Without any proof of authenticity, how would I know I’m buying the real deal?"
"Ah, if you are doubting its performance, you can easily test it out in one of the simulators I have at hand if you are a potentate. For a small deposit of 100,000 marks, I can also let you bring my Crystal Lord to the nearest practice yard and let you or a potentate friend try out my product. You’ll be able to see that it is absolutely authentic!"
Really now. Ves knew that the seller wouldn’t expose any loopholes in this fashion. The simulator likely made use of the official virtual version of the Crystal Lord. As for bringing the Crystal Lord to a practice yard, such locations only allowed mechs to perform a limited amount of actions. They couldn’t even move at a running pace according to the rules, let alone have another mech shoot a laser weapon at the Crystal Lord’s center crystal to test out its trump card.
All in all, even if a prospective customer trailed the Crystal Lord, they would only experience the mech’s performance on the surface, which likely didn’t deviate very much from the real deal.
"I think I better look elsewhere, then. Thank you for answering my questions."
"Hey, if there are any problems, I can give you a discount! What about one percent off? Our prices are negotiable!"
Ves walked away while his group members gawked at him or regarded him with mixed expressions. Once Ves led them out of earshot from the Reinaldan stall owner, he slumped a bit.
"Give me a moment, please."
Ves opened up his military comm. He still retained the loosened restrictions from his field promotion to head designer. This enabled a couple of various handy functions, one of which was to record some footage of what happened around him. In addition, the block on interacting with the galactic net had temporarily been lifted.
After all, a communications blockade wouldn’t be very useful if Ves could borrow the comm from any bystander to utilize the galactic net.
Ves selected a file and saw that it had recorded the entire conversation and more. He composed a quick message to Calsie back in Cloudy Curtain and attached the file before he sent the entire package.
"Let’s go, Nolsen."
The Vandals eventually shrugged and resumed their window shopping. The only thing that changed was that some of them asked for his analysis on certain mechs.
During their stroll through the plaza, Ves encountered many different second-hand mechs. Many of them looked like they had been salvaged from the battlefield and fixed up to look better than their actual condition. He guessed that most of their internals might not be as pristine.
This was one of the areas in which the customers needed to make their own judgement. People in need of mechs might be able to pick up a good bargain if they had good eyes, but most likely they would get ripped off in the end. It all depended on their skill and luck.
"There’s a thrill out of shopping for a second-hand mech." A Vandal group member remarked. "Maybe some of them used to be piloted by heroes. Maybe they killed a lot of people. Who knows. Every mech has their own story."
Ves silently agreed with that. When he brushed his spiritual senses towards the mechs that looked worse off, he tasted echoes of what the mech experienced in the past. Though the recollections he sensed was too indistinguishable for him to make sense of them, it was undeniable that some of these mechs had gone through a lot.
It was too bad that their physical condition leaned towards the lower end. This made sense, as older mechs invariably sustained a lot of damage. The mechs that looked like they only entered the battlefield once or twice felt like dummies in comparison.
Everyone enjoyed looking at the second-hand mechs and made a game out of guessing why it ended up in the mech plaza. Their former owners must have certainly met an unfortunate end for their mechs to be displayed and sold in Harkensen.
One thing that Ves took note that sales appeared to be rather slow. Maybe ninety-nine percent out of every visitor were like the Vandals, who merely wanted to see the sights. Those that looked like they might be serious buyers tended to focus their attention on the cheaper mechs priced at 10 million marks or lower.
This highlighted the low status of the second-hand market. The people or outfits that had the funds to buy a mech would almost always opt to buy a new one. There were mechs for almost every possible price segment. With all the shenanigans that went on in the second-hand market, only the most desperate customers and special cases considered them seriously.
"Alright, we’ve gone through the whole plaza. Let’s move on to the main shopping streets."
The group left the mech plaza and its eclectic collection of second-hand mechs and moved over to the main streets which hosted various mech shops. Different from the chaotic plaza, the main streets appeared far more classier and orderly. The clean white streets and luxurious storefronts made it clear that only those with money would have a chance of spending it in one of the shops here.
Various strange but fancy looking shop brands adorned the storefront. Some of them only sold one brand of mechs, while others sold a variety of models from all over the galactic rim.
Ves looked at a storefront that sold spaceborn mechs. Projections of elegant mechs with hawk wings soared through space as they battled generic opponents in a simulated battle. He wondered if the LMC set up a franchise in one of these streets.
"Probably not. I haven’t seen any plans to that end when I was still helming the LMC."
While shopping for a mech on the galactic net was convenient, the problem was that customers had too much choice. Investing in a physical storefront to profile your own brand of mechs allowed a company to stand out from the crowd. Considering that the LMC mostly spent its energies on selling premium mechs, operating a couple of physical stores in high end shopping streets might be worth the effort.
"We’re being followed." Nolsen said as the group made it to the end of one of the mech avenues. "Don’t look back, you idiots! It’s nothing serious yet if our watcher isn’t good enough to hide his presence from me."
Ves tried really hard not to turn around. He never had a clue that someone followed their group around.
Trian Earls, one of their mech pilots, spat on the pavement. "Why aren’t we doing anything? Let’s go beat the fellow up!"
"Making a move in the middle of Black Belle City’s shopping district will only land us in trouble. Look at how many patrolmen of the Planetary Guard are patrolling the streets. We’ll be sludged and put into custody the second we throw a punch."
Everyone glanced at the uniformed law enforcement officers. They patrolled in teams of two, and wore enough gear to repel a small riot. In addition to their personal capabilities, they were also followed by a hovering bot armed with non-lethal weaponry.
The bot alone was programmed to instantly stun someone from a distance the moment they pulled out a weapon.
"Who’s following us?" Ves asked. "Can you tell?"
The lieutenant furrowed his brows as they pretended to look through the windows of another upscale mech store. "He doesn’t look like a pro. Likely a local gang member. Or someone who never intended to hide his presence in the first place. Right now, the fact that someone is tailing us does not mean that we’re in danger. For now, we can rely on the Planetary Guards and the Honored Ones to forestall any trouble."
Half an hour passed by without a single change. The group members calmed down and resumed their window shopping. The mech avenues truly formed a snapshot of all the mech models sold in the Komodo Star Sector.
Studying the mechs the shops had to offer gave Ves a good idea of the state of the mech industry in the Reinald Republic.
Different from larger states such as the Bright Republic and the Vesia Kingdom, the Reinald Republic was too small to foster a strong and relatively independent mech industry. Apart from supporting a couple of crown jewels, the bulk of the businesses operating in their territory consisted of foreign entities.
While the Frozen Leaf Alliance that the Reinald Republic was apart of gave them the strength to contend against the Vesians in a military fashion, it did not do too much beyond that. Each of the three member states still ran their territories as a separate entity. They refused to operate as a single market with shared borders and a unified economy.
This left the Reinald Republic without the strength to punch above its weight. Its own domestic market couldn’t possibly satisfy a fully mature domestic mech industry.
It was a good thing that the Reinald Republic attracted a lot of foreign visitors. Plenty of mercenaries, gang members, treasure hunters and worse visited the small state to do business. Because each of their outfits based themselves in different states, the Reinald Republic attracted foreign mech manufacturers to set up shop in their trading systems.
After walking past numerous shops, Ves finally found a legitimate vendor for the mechs of the LMC. The group entered a store called The Brightest Mech. Both the Blackbeak and the Crystal Lord occupied a prominent place in the store that obviously catered to Brighters and fans of Brighter mechs.
"Wow. Is that your work as well? This knight mech looks so light!"
"Damn! 135 million marks for a Blackbeak? And it’s only a bronze label? What a ripoff!"
Ves awkwardly laughed. "These mech models are aimed at the premium market. If you look at the spec sheet, you’ll know why they cost so much."
The Brightest Mech featured tasteful decoration themed around torches and stars. It played out as an exaggerated caricature of Brighter culture, and every Vandal couldn’t help but be amused. Whoever operated this shop probably knew nothing about the Bright Republic.
The shop only possessed enough room to showcase half-a-dozen physical mechs that sold the most. The rest only appeared as scaled-down projections. This also applied to the mechs of the LMC. Their high price tag threw off most potential customers.
"What a shame."
If The Brightest Mech devoted some of its limited physical space to showcasing a silver label mech of the LMC, a lot of customers would likely be swayed into buying them. The charm of the X-Factor couldn’t be perceived from a projection, and even a simulation wasn’t able to bring out its full strength.
Ves figured that the LMC might be better off operating their own stores. This allowed the company to exert full control over how to present and sell their offerings. The only issue right now was that his company didn’t have enough original models to justify such a plan.
There was another issue as well. The LMC faced various hurdles each time it tried to enter a new foreign market. Sometimes, the only way they could enter the market was if they partnered up with a native company. The mechs would then be sold through the native company’s own sales channels.
If the LMC wanted to keep their cooperation with the locals going, they had to refrain from snatching meat from their partner’s mouths.
"How complicated." He shook his head. Ves left the matter for later.
Once the group of ten had their fill of seeing familiar mechs, they exited the store and wandered around aimlessly for a while. They eventually ate some lunch before deciding to stroll through a non-mech shopping district.
This time they looked at numerous wondrous products, from luxury comm models to mechanical pets that bore a vague resemblance to Lucky. The AIs that operated the tiny puppies and kittens was very sophisticated, enabling them to speak and interact with children.
Larger pets existed as well with some forms of self-defense. Mechanical dogs proved to be the all-time popular, occupying a full third of the entire store. Customers bought many of the dogs in order to enhance the security of their households or provide some protection against random thugs.
Naturally, truly important figures wouldn’t resort to mass-market mechanical pets. Any determined hacker would be able to intrude their operating systems, so these pets mostly catered to the lower-middle class.
The most impressive pet model by far was an aircar-sized dragon. Sophisticated anti-grav modules and various other creature comforts turned it into an impressive flying mount.
Few actually bought it though. In order to make it harder for it to be hacked, it ran on a very advanced processor and operating system. Subscribing to the mandatory security suite alone cost more than 100,000 marks a year. This went well above the limits of the middle class.
"I wouldn’t know what to do with such an expensive pet." Ensign Tiss said as she admired the mechanical dragon’s exquisite construction. The store normally sold it with a plain metallic surface, but they also offered the option of covering it with life-like dragon scales. "Could you create something like this on your own?"
"Maybe. I’d have to approach it as if I was designing a mech. Hm, if so, it might be feasible. The only area which I’m not very sure of is the operating system."
Ves realized he might have talent in creating a pet as it wouldn’t be too different from designing and fabricating a miniature mech.
Though a lot of mechanical pets got sold each year, their revenue and profit margins paled in comparison to the mech market. Ves had no reason to abandon his current vocation.
As the Vandals weren’t allowed to bring anything back with them, they regretfully had to leave the shop behind. Interacting with all of the friendly pets in the store really helped lift some of their moods.
As the Vandals gawked at various curiosities, Nolsen spoke up again. "Hey, sorry to spoil your moods for a moment, but our watcher has a companion on the opposite street."
"What are these fellows doing? Can’t they observe us from remote?"
The security officer discreetly shook his head. "There are too many ways to spoil such things. My comm contains a security suite that can easily scramble smaller probes. In addition, the Reinaldans won’t tolerate excessive use of spying equipment in their shopping districts. The only observation tools allowed belong to the Reinaldans themselves."
"So are we being watched by someone other than the government?"
"I’d say it’s likely, but we can’t rule out the government, you know. The spies may be there to act as failsafes if we ever try to scramble all of the sensors in the vicinity. Trust me, my comm can do that. To guard against unexpected equipment failure, some plain humans can keep us under observation while they try to get new bugs on site."
Ves scratched his head. He hated playing games like this where he ended up in a passive state. He knew more than Lieutenant Feray and the rest of the group.
It caused Ves to see shadows where none should appear. The wide streets became a prison and every casual bystander might actually harbor ill intentions to the Vandals.
A faint instinct of danger tickled his mind. It was not enough for him to suspect a concrete threat, but it might be a sign of what was in store.
Some days ago, Lieutenant Commander Soapstone brought him to help negotiate the purchase of various specialized equipment. Right now, the broker must have started shipping the goods to a warehouse under the control of the Vandals.
Those who kept their eye on the Vandals must be wondering why they sought to procure so much equipment that would only be useful in high gravity environments.
"Don’t mind the watchers. We’re all innocent Vandals here. We’ve got nothing to hide."
They took it easy in the next hours. Besides visiting various stores, they also entered a museum and visited a few monuments that originated from the founding of the Reinald Republic.
None of the states in the Komodo Star Sector was very old. The entire star sector only opened up for colonization shortly after the Age of Mechs commenced.
At the later stages of the Age of Conquest, human warfleets scoured many planets of life. Once the flames of war died down, the MTA and CFA fostered a great undertaking where it became popular to set out for the furthest reaches of the rim to form new colonies.
The Reinald Republic was one of the losers for the mad scramble for stars at the opening of the star sector. The Bright Republic and the Vesia Kingdom might have been bumped from the resource-rich center of the star sector, but they found adequate clusters of stars to settle upon.
The founders of the Reinald Republic fought with the larger third-rate states for a time, but eventually had to admit defeat in yet again. The star systems that encompassed Reinald wasn’t promising at all. This gave the smaller state a lot of distress until they found a lifeline in tourism and trade in illicit goods.
When evening came by, the group wanted to experience some of the latter by visiting a grey market. Black Belle City happened to host a modest grey market in a vast tunnel network beneath the capital city.
It was as if they descended into a dungeon. Light was purposefully kept dim, and various invisible defense measures made the tunnels a lot more dangerous than he expected.
Nolsen looked concerned at the people that frequented the grey market. "Tuck your pistols at your side. Don’t hide them. You have to show the visitors here that you won’t be easy to bully."
They did what the lieutenant instructed. Once all ten of them showed off their laser or ballistic pistols, the eyes set upon them had diminished by a fair amount. No one wanted to stir up trouble in the grey market either, but the Reinaldans didn’t exert a lot of influence here.
Everything that happened in the grey markets came under the purview of the cartels that set them up. Immediately upon entering a large underground hall, Ves had the misconception that he returned to the mech plaza he visited in the morning. A lot of street stalls dotted the humongous underground hall.
"Now this is what I’m talking about!" A Vandal exclaimed. "This feels just like home!"
A lot of things could be bought here so long as they could pay. Ves already widened his eyes when he spotted a lot of high-value goods brought back from the frontier.This material is derived from n0v£lbin•
Ves ignored the uncertified mechs and the deadly weaponry the stall owners tried to peddle to the tourists and approached one of the stalls that sold frontier loot.
The stall in front of him sold nothing but pieces of ore. None of them shone in the light, but some of them possessed a subtle charm that somehow attracted his attention.
"Welcome, dear customer." The old man who manned the stall greeted. "Are you interested in my wares? They are genuine treasures of the frontier. Whether they are shaped by aliens hands or the natural forces of the galaxy, I am sure you can find what you seek here. Look at this white arcelyx stone for example!"
The man picked up an off-white piece of mesmerizing rock with a gloved hand. "A treasure hunter claimed to have picked this rock from a beast world. He claimed that the planet was filled with exobeasts, and if not for the fast-growing vegetation that kept the herbivores fed, the planet would have long collapsed its own ecosystem."
"What does that have to do with this rock?" Ves asked.
"The planet is sprinkled by this stuff! Hehe, the treasure hunter spent a lot of effort to find these anomalous rocks. At first, he didn’t know their effects, but once he returned to Mancroft Independent Harbor, the effects of this stone finally came into being."
"And that is?"
The stall owner grinned at him with a mischievous expression. "The treasure hunter upended an entire entertainment establishment! Mere proximity to this amazing stone will give you the firepower of a water hose and the endurance of a long-range mech!"
Ves and a few other Vandals attracted to the curiosities offered by the stall looked incredulous.
"You don’t believe me? Why don’t you try it out for yourselves!" The stall owner dropped the hand-sized rock and retrieved some boxes from under the stall. Each of them came with a transparent cover that showed off the slivers of white rock contained within. "A full-sized arcelyx stone can be had for 57,000 marks! If you want to sample its effects, this nail-sized sample can be yours for 500 marks!"
"No thanks." Ves immediately turned away. When he saw that some of the other men looked tempted, he gently pulled them away. "Don’t fall for his story. What exotic treasure, in my eyes the rock is plain ghoshaw ore. It’s an uncommon but fairly abundant ore in the Komodo Star Sector. Its market price is around two-thousand bright credits per ton."
That convinced them all to drop any interest of the supposed ’arcelyx stone’.
"How did you recognize that it was ghoshaw ore?" One Vandal asked.
"I memorized a lot of ores and materials that are available in the Komodo Star Sector. It’s necessary for my work."
Every mech designer worth a damn studied the full list of publicly available materials in their star sector. It could be said that each star sector invented their own unique brand of mechs. Maybe one star sector possessed a lot of exotics favorable to smaller mechs. This would certainly make the region focus their design efforts into developing lots of light mechs.
The group wandered over towards different stalls, making their way through the crowds as best they could. The underground halls offered as much space as the avenues above, but the Vandals barely had any space to move due to the abundance of tourists.
The difference in interest was obvious. Although the luxury shops on the surface sold a lot of good products, the same could be found on any major planet.
In contrast, the grey market offered goods that couldn’t easily be found elsewhere. Many other grey markets restricted their access to known acquaintances.
For example, when Ves wanted something shady, he wouldn’t know where to turn. He had to resort to contacting Dietrich to obtain what he wanted from the grey or black markets.
This highlighted the special and open nature of the Harkensen System. Their grey and black markets didn’t care about connections at all. Neither the seller or the buyer required trust to perform their transactions.
Due to the popularity of this market, business was booming here. Ves saw many unregistered mechs exchanging hands, though calling them unregistered was a euphemism. They should actually be called counterfeits, because they were nothing different from the fake Crystal Lord. At least the sellers were more honest in the grey market, directly admitting that the mechs had been fabricated by a mech manufacturer that hadn’t licensed their designs.
Since most licenses cost a lot of money, the true production cost of a legal mech was significantly higher than a counterfeit mech. Even if they used the exact same production standards, the counterfeit mechs wasn’t burdened by a huge amount of overhead costs.
In general, this made counterfeit mechs around ten to fifty percent cheaper to buy. The discount was more extreme for expensive mechs, as the profit margin was the highest there. Cheaper mechs already cut a lot of corners, so the price couldn’t get much lower even without considering overhead.
"Are you dissatisfied?" Tiss asked when she saw the glum face on Ves. "These counterfeit mechs are taking away your sales."
"Even if I am, what can I do about it?" Ves sighed in a tired manner. "People in need of mechs are always on the lookout for something cheaper. As long as there’s demand, there’s someone who is willing to meet it. Even if counterfeit mechs stop showing up here, business will only move elsewhere."
"Some of these mechs don’t look very reliable either. Though I’m not a mech designer, even I can see that the workmanship on them is too rough."
Ves nodded. "Without the full design schematics, the counterfeiters can only use their own judgement to fill the gaps. A fake mech will never surpass the real deal. If any counterfeiters possess the skills to improve the original design, then they are better off becoming a legitimate mech designer. Therefore, it’s virtually a rule that all counterfeit designers are failures."
Many failed mech designers that tried to operate a workshop would be saddled with debt by the time they folded their businesses. Sometimes, a bankruptcy allowed them to begin anew, but other times their creditors insisted on getting back their money.
Fabricating counterfeit mechs was a good way to earn money quickly, especially if they picked a popular mech model. The counterfeiters basically leeched off the achievements of their more successful peers.
It was a dishonest but profitable way to do business.
"If you look at some of the buyers, they don’t look like the sort that can make a legal transaction." Ves gestured at someone with a wild air. The man looked like a pirate commander who was trying his best to restrain his savage urges. "Where do you think pirates get their mechs?"
"Ah. But pirates never pilot any good mechs, right?"
"That’s because there’s no form of regulation in the underground markets. Anyone could sell a mech that is supposed to last for a decade but breaks down after a single year. Buyers have to judge the seller’s reputation. If they can’t, they should at least have a good mech appraiser by their side."
Ves spotted several men and women guiding big spenders around. They waved at the mechs on display and presumably provided a more accurate assessment of their worth.
Still, nothing could beat the MTA in terms of reputation. Their trustworthiness and reliability trumped every other mech appraiser. Their certification process was almost flawless.
Only the most obscure features defeated their comprehensive certification and validation tests. Ves was very certain that they couldn’t pick up the X-Factor.
The grey market offered more than mechs and rocks. Further ahead, they entered some kind of bestiary where a large amount of exobeasts resided inside climate-controlled cages.
Various alien beasts of all shapes and sizes could all be bought with minimal fuss, very much opposite to the strict controls that most governments set on alien creatures. After all, if specimens ever got loose, they might lead to a very troublesome cascade of failures in the local ecosystem. Remedying the problem was possible, but only at great cost.
Ves hadn’t spotted anything familiar like the hexapods of Groening IV. After witnessing those majestic beasts up close, the boring and mundane exobeasts in the grey market failed to rouse his interests. Most of them appeared to be bred and tamed by humans in some farm for generations, making them good pets for families.
"This entire grey market feels a little phony somehow." Ves remarked to Tiss. "The stuff that’s on sale here isn’t as exciting as I thought."
"Oh? All of the things that are on sale here is illegal, right?"
"That’s a matter for interpretation." He said. "There’s no way that the government doesn’t know what’s going on here. By turning a very obvious blind eye, they’ve tacitly consented to the trade that goes on in these markets."
"So it’s sort of legal, then."
Ves bet that the cartels that operated the underground markets passed some of their profits to the Reinaldan government. Everything that happened here was fully within their range of control. The giant game of pretend didn’t fool anyone.
"The thing is, I can’t figure out the MTA’s stance. On one hand, they can be very tyrannical in enforcing their taboos. On the other hand, they aren’t as diligent when it comes to smaller offenses such as selling counterfeits."
"Maybe they aren’t as powerful as you think they are." Tiss ventured out a guess. "If they’re short on manpower or resources for some reason, it makes sense if they don’t bother with the small stuff."
Ves didn’t believe this to be true. The MTA was unimaginably powerful and employed trillions of people across the galaxy. Even if they were spread a little thin in the galactic rim, they could always hire more people.
"Well, it’s difficult to determine what the MTA wants. Since they left this market alone, it probably won’t go away anytime soon."
After the group of Vandals had their fill of the exobeasts, they exited the bestiary and entered into an entirely different hall.
"Underground arena!"
A massive circular pit formed a single large arena space where two melee mechs went at each other with brutality unbecoming of a proper duelist. Shards of armor plating sheared away while the mechs went on the offensive with little guard for defense.
A large audience cheered and hooted at the spectacle happening in front of them. They all sat on the benches that went lower and lower until they reached the dueling ground.
The group quickly bumped into rough people that looked like cartel members. "We only sell all-day tickets here. Four-hundred marks per ticket. Ten-thousand marks if you want a VIP ticket. If you want to reserve a private theater box, I can take you up to the manager."
"Regular tickets please. We’ll all pay for ourselves."
Four-hundred marks amounted to two-hundred bright credits, which was barely within the range they could withstand. A regular arena ticket cost only half as much, but the sanctioned duels were never as exciting as the underground ones.
The melee mechs currently in the arena sustained more damage every second, but neither of them gave up. Ves could tell that these mechs cost quite a bit, because their armor amazingly held up for a long time.
When he looked at the size of the crowd and how many seats the arena accommodated, he knew how the arena turned a profit despite the immense damage being dealt to the competing mechs.
"Even an underground arena can host more than a hundred-thousand people!"
While the main arenas in Bentheim could host up to half a million spectators, that was in the light. Despite its dubious legality, this underground arena still managed to draw a consistent crowd of tens of thousands of people!
Ves had never thought that the underground dueling scene was so popular!
Huge crowds of humans from every corner of the Komodo Star Sector occupied the seats of the underground arena. Right now, over eighty percent of the seats of the boisterous fighting venue was filled. No matter where anyone bumped into, they would sit next to a Reinaldan or a tourist.
The chaotic crowd cheered their favorite athletes on as the brutal battle in the center entered a heated phase. The frames of both mechs started to show cracks. Some portions broke off entirely, exposing deadly weak points that could lead to instant defeat if struck.
The underground mech athletes pulled back some of their aggression at that point. Both mechs slowed down their pace, and the battle entered a strategic phase where both sides carefully tried to feint and fool their opponents.
Ves and the group of Vandals sat at a random stretch of empty seats. It took a bit of jostling and pushing to get others to make some room for themselves, but their air of savagery and intimidation easily frightened the tourists.
"So this is an underground arena?" Ves questioned. "Besides the aggressive fighting style, I don’t see the difference yet."
"That’s because both of the athletes on the stage are pussies." Trian Earls explained. Their resident mech pilot nodded contemptuously at the mechs trying to probe each other. The lack of excitement caused some of the audience members to boo. "Those mech pilots have skill, but they don’t have the heart. Besides executing their moves, they have no clue what to do. They’re probably thrill seekers looking to have some fun while they’re visiting Harkensen."
"You mean anyone can go up on stage and compete?"
"It wouldn’t be an underground arena otherwise." The Vandal mech pilot grinned. "Unlike the sanctioned mech games, there are no rules involved with the underground arena. Mech pilots don’t have to go through a strict selection process and undergo special training. Neither do they need to set up an organization to manage their team. People come and go whenever they want. They might be a pirate one day, an underground duelist the next, then back to a pirate after they have their fill."
"So the underground arena is a place for mech pilots to vent?"
"Exactly. As long as your skill level and ability isn’t too shabby, the arena operators will give you a chance. The only thing you need to keep in mind is that you have to bear all the damages yourself. You need to bring your own mech and be responsible for your own life."
In order to constantly attract new competitors, the underground arena also rewards them with a cut of the earnings. Every day, the arena earned a good amount of money in ticket sales, but this was not sufficient to keep up with the cost of running the arena.
The true money lay in gambling.
"Look at the people around you." Trian jerked his head towards the audience members. Occasionally, they raised their comm and entered a sum. "They’re all connected to the arena’s internal network. As long as you want, you can bet any sum of credits, sovvies, marks or whatever."
Ves opened up his own comm and connected to the internal network. He immediately encountered a sophisticated gambling interface that allowed him to make a bet on the five matches ahead. Betting on the current match was not allowed unless he paid for a VIP ticket, and even then it came with so many fees that even if he won the bet, he would hardly gain anything.
"I see. Any mech pilot can compete and become rich overnight as long as they draw lots of bets to themselves. Probably the only way for mech pilots to earn more is to make a name for yourself. Once you become a famous athlete, you’ll have thousands betting on your name."
The ones fumbling around on stage only comprised of the lowest tier of underground duelists. Perhaps spurred on by the many boos, the mech duelists heated up their battle. One of them finally made a mistake and left their leg vulnerable. This allowed their opponent to jab at it with their weapon, causing the leg to fail completely.
The stricken mech lost its balance, and that proved fatal as its opponent hacked off the leg and caused the damaged mech to collapse. The winner slammed its leg against the body of the fallen mech and took on a winning pose, causing the crowd to regain their cheer.
"No fatality this time." Ves said.
Underground mech athletes cherished their lives as well. Ves investigated their survival rate after finding out that his cousin Raella had joined their ranks. Though killings weren’t prohibited in the underground arena, he felt relieved that mech pilots didn’t kill each other regularly.
The nature of killings in the underground dueling scene was complex. Some people believed that the threat of death was necessary to provide the ultimate thrill to both the fighters and the audience members. The people who felt drawn to the underground arenas explicitly rejected the tradition-heavy, rule-bound mech games that played out in the open.
The hardcore mech enthusiasts thought that the current incarnation of the mech games had gone overboard in terms of prioritizing safety. The current makeup of the rules had turned what used to be a battle with people’s lives on the line to a broadcast-friendly sporting occasion.
As new mechs poured into the dueling grounds, Ves witnessed many different mechs battling it out with each other. The mechs varied from cheap light mechs to premium aerial rifleman mechs. Both sides hit each other with a lot more daring than at the mech games.
Deaths hadn’t fallen yet, but the mech pilots hadn’t shied away at aiming their attacks on their opponent’s cockpits. This was a big taboo in legal mech duels, but here it was used as a viable tactic to put pressure on the opponent.
The underground duelists usually admitted defeat before their opponents managed to succeed in puncturing their cockpits. If they lacked the time to do so, they immediately ejected from their mechs.
Ves therefore surmised that unless an underground duelist was stupid, they wouldn’t easily die on the dueling grounds.
"I can see the appeal now, in a way." He nodded. "Competing here is the ultimate way to polish your ability to pilot mechs. The real threat of death is an incredible stimulant to the underground mech athletes. It’s realer than simulation battles and you don’t have to go through the trouble of finding a worthy fight in the wild."
Life and death was in the mech athlete’s hands. They bore all the responsibility to themselves. To some, this was an incredibly scary burden. To others, they craved nothing more than to reach new heights by putting their own lives at stake.
Ves figured that mech pilots deep in debt might resort to competing in the underground arenas to climb out of their hopeless situation. As long as they succeeded in winning a couple of matches, they could easily pay back old debts and start anew.
His spiritual sense tasted the desperation in some of the mech pilots that competed on the stage. The flavors came mostly from the shabbier-looking mechs. Ves figured they must be former members of disbanded outfits or survivors of a losing battle.
One battle happened to pit two of them in a single match.
The announcer gleefully introduced the competitors as they entered the killing field. "We’ve got some special duelists here for you tonight! On the west side is Broken Claw! He’s a Reinaldan veteran that fought for several mercenary corps for over twenty years! Though he’s encountered numerous disasters in his life, his ability to sustain his life is second-to-none!"
A worn-out medium bestial mech in the shape of a giant tiger stepped forth from the west gate. The mech was coated in blue marked with black tiger stripes. Besides its fearsome looking claws and jaws, the mech also featured weapons mounts to its side. Two kinetic weapon barrels extended out from the flanks, though one of them was broken.
"On the east side is Avid Serpent! An intrepid Vesian mech pilot, she deserted the Vesian Mech Legion and made a name for herself in Reinaldan space! Her medium axeman mech is the ultimate shield breaker, but will she be able to cope with Broken Claw’s mobility?"
Speculation ran rife among the crowd. Even the group of Vandals that Ves was with started to discuss the merits of each mech pilot. They even opened their comms and prepared to bid on one of the two duelists on the field.
It was a custom in the underground arenas to use pseudonyms to refer to the participants. The real identities of many duelists was rather sensitive, so it was better for everyone if nobody knew their actual names. Both the mech pilots and underground arena operators abided by this custom.
This also made it harder to determine which mech pilot would be a good choice to bet upon. Unless they became a professional underground mech athlete like Raella, the crowd practically bet their money away at random.
"Broken Claw is a battle-tested veteran." Trian spoke. He obviously favored the pilot of the tiger mech over the axeman mech. "Even if he’s a mercenary like the announcer has claimed, a twenty-year mercenary veteran that has mixed up in Reinaldan space has surely experienced a lot of chaos. I wouldn’t be surprised if he joined an outfit that pretended to be pirates and raided Vesian space a few times."
"Who do you favor, Tiss?" Ves asked.
"Hmm, I think I’ll put my money on Avid Serpent. She’s a woman, and girls like us need to stick together."
Nolsen Feray chose to bet a thousand marks on Broken Claw, which was the biggest bet in their group so far. "Avid Serpent is absolutely not a simple mech pilot. You can tell from the marks of her mech that she’s gone through hell and survived."
"Then why did you bet on Broken Claw?"
"Avid Serpent is restrained by her mech type. Between an axeman mech and a tiger mech, I would put my money on the latter anytime. Besides, Broken Claw’s mech still has an intact ranged weapon. That will give him an immediate advantage."
Ves did not think the matchup would be so simple. He felt as if the underground arena organizers deliberately presented what appeared to be a lopsided matchup. The words they used painted a rosier picture for Broken Claw. As for Avid Serpent, they not only painted her with a dishonorable label of deserter, they also reminded the crowd that axeman mechs specialised in tearing down low-mobility knights.
He witnessed enough mech battles to know that mech types didn’t dictate which mech would win. The quality of the mechs and the skill and disposition of the mech pilots also mattered a lot.
Thus, he used his own judgement to analyze the odds of winning.
He couldn’t tell much about the mech pilots. At this distance and in the middle of a crowd of thousands, he could hardly distinguish the nuances of the man-machine connections in the middle. Probing their strength via spirituality wouldn’t work.
He could only rely on his judgement as a mech designer.
"Broken Claw’s tiger mech is a formidable machine, but it bears the sign of sloppy, jury-rigged repairs. You can see some discoloration on some of the portions of the frame. That’s a strong sign that the mech is patchworked with inferior armor. Don’t look at the bestial mech as if it’s a strong machine. In truth, it is riddled with holes."
"What about Avid Serpent’s mech?"
"Her axeman mech is in better shape, but her mech model is of an inferior grade. Its overall build is cheaper and the amount of strength it can exert is lower. However, the axeman mech is taller. Everyone knows that bestial mechs aren’t very good at defending from attacks from above. I think her mech is nimble enough to dodge most attacks from Broken Claw."
Weighing the properties of the two mechs against each other, he chose to bet 500 marks on Avid Serpent. Of course, this amount of money hardly mattered to him, but he didn’t have access to his main accounts right now. Besides, he was only placing a bet for fun.
"Let’s see if my judgement is accurate."
As soon as the signal blared, Avid Serpent’s axeman mech sprinted towards Broken Claw’s tiger mech. The sand pit that made up the underground arena’s soil provided some challenges to the running motions of both mechs. This slowed down the speed of any mechs that ran across the arena.
Avid Serpent appeared to be caught off-guard of her mech’s unstable footing. She was forced to pull back on the throttle, giving her opponent a little more time to respond.
BOOM!
Broken Claw’s only intact kinetic weapon mount shot out a solid slug that accurately impacted Avid Serpent’s mech! Her axemen mech dodged at the last moment, causing the slug to hit its sides rather than its abdomen. The hard slug managed to dig a shallow groove in the sides of the mech. It went through several layers of armor plating!
"Give it up, girlie!" A Reinaldan-accented voice boomed from the tiger mech as it stepped back to put more distance between them. The voice went through a warbler that prevented the crowd from matching a name to the voice. "I’ve fought over fifty battles and survived! There’s nothing you can do that can baffle me! I suggest you bow down before you damage your precious mech!"
The axeman mech didn’t take it lying down and began to accelerate abruptly. Though its footing was a little sketchy, Avid Serpent appeared to be adjusting quickly.
One hand of her mech raised its axe to the air, as if it was ready to split the heavens and earth. While most of the crowd followed the rise of the axe, Avid Serpent’s mech abruptly pulled out a holdout pistol from a hidden compartment from behind and shot at the tiger mech!
"Two can play this game!" The warbled voice of Avid Serpent arose from her own mech.
The underground arena deliberately amplified and spread out their dialogue to ensure the entire crowd followed their words.
Though the axeman mech wasn’t a hero mech, its humanoid form and articulated arms didn’t prevent it from wielding other weapons!
Laser beams scorched the tiger mech. Though the beams didn’t possess a lot of power, Avid Serpent cleverly tried to hit the main sensors mounted on the face of the tiger mech. She was attempting to cripple its eyes!
Broken Claw growled in anger. "Now you’ve pissed me off!"
The tiger mech unleashed another kinetic projectile from its side barrel. Broken Claw’s aim was remarkably good! However, Avid Serpent’s reaction didn’t fall behind, and she pulled her mech aside at the last moment.
This time, the axeman mech suffered a shallower graze.
Throughout its dash, the axeman mech continued to pelt the tiger mech with laser beams.
Though Broken Claw’s mech only suffered superficial damage, the laser beams fell dangerously close to its vulnerable sensors. The possibility of letting his mech’s eyes be blinded was a huge shame to him. The tiger mech stopped retreated but instead started to advance.
"They’re going at it for real this time!"
At some time, Avid Serpent retrieved the pistol and focused instead on her footwork. The axeman mech gained enough proficiency in navigating through the sand that it even started displaying a special dodging technique.
The next kinetic projectile missed entirely!
There was no more time for Broken Claw to unleash another kinetic projectile. The two mechs almost reached each other. When they were just a few seconds from colliding against each other, they each unleashed their separate moves!
Broken Claw opted to make the best use of his mech’s momentum, and threw his bestial mech into a leap while immediately putting both claws forward!
Perhaps anticipating her opponent’s attack, Avid Serpent chose to make away. Her axeman mech dashed against the sand and pushed it to the left, putting the mech barely out of the trajectory of the tiger mech’s immense bulk.
Her mech successfully dodged the first attack!
The axemen mech not only dodged the tiger mech’s leap, it also chopped down with its axe, seeking to breach the spine of the tiger mech as it whooshed past its target!
The air seemed to woosh around the scarred but sturdy axe. Just before the blade of the axe managed to connect to the tiger mech, the latter mech’s rear paws abruptly lashed out to the side with a handful of claws drawn out!
Broken Claw not only used the chest of the axeman mech as a springboard, he also left some awful claw marks behind!
The crowd went wild at that moment! Supporters of Avid Serpent groaned as her mech stumbled backwards from the attack.
"Come on, Avid Serpent! Show the old geezer what girls can do!"
"You almost got him! You can do better next time!"
Meanwhile, those who put their chips on Broken Claw boosted him on. "Claw her to death! Show these foreigners how Reinaldans fight!"
"Don’t let Reinald down!"
The two mechs quickly readjusted and clashed again. This time, the tiger mech barely fended off the heavy axe chop from Avid Serpent. Though the axeman mech was a little lighter, its axe strikes shouldn’t be belittled. A dozen more strikes like that would certainly break the tiger mech’s claws!
"Worthy of a shield breaker! That axe chop is so powerful!"
"Humanoid mechs are better than animal mechs! Only the human form allows you to utilize all kinds of techniques!"
The difference between humanoid mechs and bestial mechs came to the fore. Humans knew humanoid mechs the best, and developed or adapted all kinds of exquisite techniques to best leverage its power.
It could be said that the complexity surrounding humanoid mechs was one of the principal reasons why mech training lasted so many years.
A badly trained pilot would be able to exert only ten to thirty percent of a humanoid mech’s strength. Most of its power would likely be wasted by inefficient motions.
On the other hand, a well-trained pilot would easily be able to draw out a hundred percent of the strength of their mech. In addition, the amount of force it could exert could easily reach up to five-hundred percent if it leveraged its weight and momentum behind their attacks!
The battle between Broken Claw and Avid Serpent showcased two opposite approaches to putting more than a hundred percent power behind their attacks.
While humanoid attacks relied on their vertical posture, flexible limbs and sophisticated techniques to drive their attacks, bestial mechs focused on taking advantage of their natural forms. The latter type of mechs might not possess as much variety in their movements and attack motions, but each of its actions were marked with force and speed.
Broken Claw displayed an intimate familiarity with the strengths and limits of a bestial mech. His old tiger mech didn’t attempt to fight the axeman mech upfront. Instead, it kept leaping or making flank attacks, preferring sideswipes over all-in attacks. The mech’s powerful movements granted by its four paws gave it a strong advantage in mobility.
"Is that the best a Vesian can do?!" Broken Claw taunted. "Deserters deserve to be buried in interstellar space!"
A roar emerged from Avid Serpent as she drove her mech to a more aggressive attack pattern. "You’ll regret those words! A merc like you who never put his life on the line for his state will never understand what it’s like to fight in the frontlines!"
The people in the stands cheered and whooped at the drama occurring on the fighting field. Everyone loved to put a story to the names. A colorful background increased their interest in the duelists!
"Tigers need to be put back in their cages!"
The axeman mech seemed to tire of the drive-by attacks of the tiger mech. It abruptly leapt forward, disrupting the tiger mech’s timing. Both mechs leapt at each other in a haphazard manner, but the difference was that Avid Serpent’s mech spun around its frame!
The extra rotation along with excellent control caused Avid Serpent’s axe to dig into one of the tiger mech’s paws! The axe pierced through the thin layers of armor and practically savaged the limb!
"Down goes a paw!"
The tiger mech hastily pulled back. Though one of its forepaws ceased to be capable of launching any further attacks, the mech’s mobility hadn’t been affected too much.
If a humanoid mech lost a leg, it immediately turned into an immobile and very vulnerable machine.
If a bestial mech lost one of their limbs, chances were it would still be able to maintain at least seventy percent of its maximum speed.
Broken Claw’s experience showed as he easily adjusted his tiger mech’s movement to avoid putting on weight on its damaged limb.
Supporters of Broken Claw cried out in shock or anger. A significant part of the crowd consisted of local Reinaldans. Though they didn’t put their bets on their kinsmen all the time, they always acted on their biases to an extent. It wouldn’t be surprising to find out that over two-thirds of all of the Reinaldans put their money on Broken Claw.
"Come on, Broken Claw! You can still do it! Smash that Vesian mech apart!"
Despite the damage it incurred, the tiger mech did not let up its aggression. In Broken Claw’s perspective, to slow down now would likely widen the gap between his damaged mech and Avid Serpent’s relatively intact mech. He desperately needed to equalize the state of their mechs.
Avid Serpent fell in the leeway in the next minute. Broken Claw continued to push his tiger mech onwards in a reckless flurry of attacks. Due to the crippling of one of its forepaws, Broken Claw quickly adjusted and launched more attacks from its rear limbs. Though it these kinds of attacks were awkward to pull off, the extra power behind the rear limbs caused Avid Serpent to dread getting hit again. Her axemen mech’s chest had lost a lot of integrity from the earlier attack.
"Are you a turtle of an axeman mech?! Show some guts!" Broken Claw yelled out.
"You’ll be at the end of your ropes soon enough!" His opponent yelled back. "Come and peel away my shell if you dare!"
It was obvious that Avid Serpent knew what her opponent was thinking about. She switched from offense to defense the moment Broken Claw sought to accomplish a breakthrough. When Avid Serpent put her full mind on defense, the advantages of her humanoid mech came to the fore.
Her medium mech possessed enough leg power and overall mobility to dodge the simple attacks of the tiger mech. Though the latter machine’s attacks possessed a lot of power, their inherent simplicity made it easy for Avid Serpent to anticipate the possible attacks. Bestial mechs also didn’t lend themselves well to feints, so Broken Claw didn’t possess too many means of opening up the axeman mech to a critical attack.
The aggressive brawl turned into a contest of patience and endurance. The crowd sat tight while the two mechs competed on which mech would last the most.
Arenas limited the amount of power a mech would be able to bring on the battlefield. This prevented boring battles of attrition that stretched out for hours at a time.
It seemed that underground arenas craved excitement, because the mechs showed signs of winding down after an intensive battle.
"As expected, the tiger mech is faltering." Ves said. "It’s slim form and substantial armor doesn’t leave much room inside its body. There’s no way it can fit a lot of energy cells inside its frame."
Every mech only brought out a percentage of its maximum energy charge to the arena stage. A mech built for endurance would still be able to last a long time even with only twenty percent charge.
On the other hand, a mech built for peak performance might already start to shut down in ten minutes or less at twenty percent charge.
Both of the mechs on stage happened to fall in between. They didn’t feature the best endurance, but they could slog it out over a campaign without requiring constant recharges.
The tiger mech critically faltered in its steps due to a sluggish response to one of its other limbs. A critical misstep occurred due to a lack of power being directed to its engine!
"You’re finished!" Avid Serpent exulted and spun her mech into a spin that hit the tiger mech’s head and split it apart.
The damage jolted the tiger mech, but Broken Claw wasn’t resigned to defeat. "Even if I’m going down, I’m bringing you with me, Vesian!"
The tiger mech jerked forward and went all-in, trying to enveloping the entire frame of its opponents into a deadly hug.
However, contrary to her words, Avid Serpent did not follow up on her last attack. Instead, she delayed, causing the tiger mech to grab empty air. Just as the tiger mech landed on the ground, the axeman mech unleashed a simple chop against its back.
CRACK!
This time, the tiger mech’s spine suffered crippling damage!
CRACK!
A second chop followed soon after that dug into the cavity opened up by the previous chop. This time, the power reactor suffered a substantial failure that caused it to stutter.
Avid Serpent was well in her rights to deliver another attack. Her axe raised above the air, and Ves could imagine where it would land. Broken Claw’s cockpit was vulnerable.
The axe barely started flowing down when the tiger mech’s back abruptly exploded. Broken Claw chose to eject!
"Winner, Avid Serpent!"
Avid Serpent refused to move at the end of the match. Even as a bunch of heavy lifter bots hauled Broken Claw’s tiger mech away, the axeman mech remained on the arena grounds.
The audience members stilled as they sensed an unusual spectacle coming.
"Avid Serpent! Avid Serpent! Avid Serpent!" Her new fans repeated her pseudonym like a mantra.
After half a minute of inactivity, her mech finally raised its axe!
"Who said that I was a deserter?! Who said that I’m a coward who values her life over her loyalty? I am a Vesian! That remains true whether I’m part of the Mech Legion or not! I have fought and bled for my state for years, and I will do so once again!"
"Vesia! Vesia! Vesia!"
"Sod off, you Vesians! This is the Reinald Republic!"
"Kick her out already! I wanna see the next duel!"
Ves and the rest of the Vandals looked unsettled. They might have cheered if they shared the same nationality as Avid Serpent, but the fact of the matter was that she fought on behalf of the enemy. No matter how valiant she appeared right now, the enemy was the enemy.
"What do you think she’s doing?" Ensign Tiss asked.
"No idea." He shrugged. "Is this even allowed?"
"There are no rules in the arena." Trian explained. Only a mech pilot understood other mech pilots best. "All types of desperate people compete in the underground arena. The operators love a good drama, and winning a match gives the mech pilot the undivided attention of the crowd. You can do a lot with that attention."
Lieutenant Feray nodded. "I’ve been to a few underground rings. Some mech pilots who compete in these arenas are trying to get hired. Others wish to absolve their mistakes and regain their honor. It sounds like Avid Serpent falls under that category."
The ebuilliant crowd smelled a good story, and sat in anticipation for the Vesian mech duelist’s next words.
"Vesians! I have never forgotten you, nor have I forsaken the stars that I call home! Let me prove my allegiance to you by taking revenge for the shame you have suffered in recent times!"
A large amount of ooh’s and aah’s ran through the crowd.
"As a Vesian citizen, I’ve followed the news and I’m as depressed and ashamed as any of you! The shamelessness of the Bright Republic knows no bounds! Their dishonorable Mech Corps sent out their most depraved mech regiment of all, the Flagrant Vandals, to kill and raid our innocent civilians!"
"I love you, Flagrant Vandals!"
"Meh, the Vandals are the mutts of the Mech Corps!"
"Hahaha! The Flagrant Vandals are the pride of the Bright Republic!"
"The Flagrant Vandals are nothing but pirates in disguise!"
"That means they have Reinaldan blood in them!"
The Vesian mech duelist let the crowd simmer a bit before continuing. "Hearing people’s praise of the Flagrant Vandals makes my blood boil to the brim! Shame on you for idolizing this gathering of thieves! From their name alone they actually take pride in their wickedness! Their crimes against the Kingdom are innumerable! From throwing artificial meteorites into a populated city, to capturing one of our revered Venerables without her own expert mech, how low can they go?!"
Her words polarized the crowd. Since the Reinald Republic bordered the Vesia Kingdom, they paid a lot of attention on what went on with their bigger neighbor. The Bright-Vesia Wars became a keen topic of interest in their daily lives.
Recently, nothing caught more attention than the actions of the Flagrant Vandals. The main fleet had inexplicably split in two, with one branch heading towards the Reinald Republic! Practically everyone followed the exploits of the Verle Task Force and its hard-fought victories against some of the best the Vesians threw at them. Each time the Vandals overcame an obstacle, the admiration among the Reinaldans grew.
Due to the fact that the Reinaldans considered the Vesians as an ominous rivals, the success of the Flagrant Vandals was something to be celebrated. By far the overwhelming majority of the Reinald Republic approved of their achievements.
Not only that, most of the foreigners who visited the Harkensen System admired their performance under adversity as well. It took a lot of guts and ingenuity to run the gauntlet from the middle of an entire enemy state! Nobody pitied the Vesians for their failure to stop the task force from escaping their territories when they had countless mechs at their disposal.
Of course, the outsiders only formed their opinions from a narrow perspective. They didn’t have access to the full picture. The Vesians were not only hampered by their serious internal division, they also faced many limitations and setbacks by the low-key actions of the rebel groups that acted as a cancer to the Kingdom.
How could patriotic Vesians not stand still as their state received a battering from the public? Foreign bystanders fundamentally misunderstood the odds stacked against the Mech Legion!
"I say no more! No more hero worship for the Flagrant Vandals! Wicked thieves deserve to be scorned rather than worshipped! I may be all alone out here, but the Kingdom lives on within my heart!"
Avid Serpent’s axeman mech abruptly threw its axe to the ground. The blade of the axe dug into the sand like a falling executioner’s axe! The thud rang through the hall like a drumbeat through everyone’s ears.
"On behalf of the stars that I call home, I issue a challenge to the Flagrant Vandals! I know you are here! There is no one here who have missed your triumphant arrival in the Harkensen System! Stand up from the seats and show yourselves!"
The entire crowd fell silent. Those who stood immediately sat down. No bystander wanted to earn the spicy Vesian mech duelist’s ire. Avid Serpent’s axeman mech slowly turned around to behold the entire audience.
"Where are you, Vandals? I’m right here! Are you brave enough to meet my challenge?"
The arena lights dimmed down until the entire underground space fell into shadows. A series of flood lights illuminated from above. The largest one shone upon Avid Serpent’s mech standing with its axe thrown before in an immensely heroic bearing.
The other flood lights shone upon several clumps of people sitting in the stands. One one them happened to land squarely on Ves’ group!
Nolsen cursed. "Damn Reinaldans. They’re putting us on the spot! Can’t we enjoy some privacy?"
None of the Vandals in the group looked pleased at Avid Serpent’s naked challenge. Her slanderous words belittled the herculean challenge of fighting their way out of Vesian space. How could they take her words lying down?
Yet her challenge also seemed iffy. Why would she issue a challenge to the Flagrant Vandals out of the blue? Was it because she felt genuinely indignant about the Vesia Kingdom’s defeats? Was she grasping at straws in order to win back honor for herself? Or were others instigating this fight from the dark?
No matter how fishy the situation looked, the Flagrant Vandals had been put in the spotlight. Refusing to stand up to Avid Serpent’s brazen challenge would tarnish their hard-fought reputation.
The only problem was that the Vandals had all split up in groups of ten and went their separate ways. Even if a lot of groups attended the underground matches, nobody knew whether they were the highest ranking officers on site. Unless Major Verle was present in the flesh, no one dared to speak on behalf of their entire unit.
"I see you, Vandals!" Avid Serpent broadcasted from her mech as it pointed a finger at the people under the spotlight. "Come on! You think you can rest on your laurels? Think again! Are the big bad Vandals cowering from a lone Vesian like me? You craven Brighters! Stand up and face my challenge!"
Every off-duty Vandal had to repress their anger. In order to preserve the dignity of their mech regiment, they rigidly stayed in place and kept their mouths shut. Spouting random words in the glare of the public eye might lead to a devastating outcome. No Vandal wanted to bear the responsibility for staining their unit.
Ves looked at the Vandals sitting next to him and knew that none of them possessed the clout to represent the Vandals when they spoke. The highest ranking officer among them was Lieutenant Nolsen Feray, and he was only a mere security officer. A proper response to Avid Serpent’s challenge should be given by a mech officer, but all they had was Trian and another mech pilot. Both of them were relatively junior mech pilots who made up the rank-and-file.
Luckily, one of the other Vandal groups in the audience happened to bring a mech officer. A single figure stood up from the spotlight and a familiar voice rang out. The arena operators already made a move to amplify her voice.
"You want to challenge my mech regiment? What gives you the qualifications to do so!"
Ves widened his eyes. He knew who was speaking out right now, and he had a very mixed history with that particular mech officer.
"I dare because I am a Vesian and I have proved my mettle on this ground! Who are you to question my qualifications?"
"I am Captain Rosa Orfan." The figure on the other side of the stands declared. "I have fought in the heart of the capital city of Detemen IV and have defeated Lord Javier’s Loquacious Raphael in person. I have subsequently hunted down and fought a Vesian expert pilot without an expert on my side on Nova Migolatus I! Twice I have taken down a Vesian elite!"
The majority of the crowd swung in Captain Orfan’s favor. The encouraging cheers fell upon her head, which swelled it past its limits!
Ves and some of the other Vandals groaned or shook their heads. Captain Orfan was one of their most problematic mech officers, though few dared to confront her about her issues. Right now, she basically inflated her importance while leaving no credit to the rest of the Vandals.
"That woman! Even if she’s a captain, she shouldn’t talk like that!" Trian complained.
"Big mouth or not, have some respect for the mech captain." Someone else said. "She can beat any of you within a minute in a mech duel. Her skills are the real deal."
"Captain Orfan." Avid Serpent spoke. "Good. Good. I am not afraid of a mech captain! Do you accept my challenge then?"
Fortunately, Captain Orfan wasn’t stupid enough to dive into the challenge without some prudence. "Only if we can agree on the terms."
"Fine! As the challenged party, you have the right to propose the terms of our duel. Speak, then!"
"Alright." Orfan said as she fell into thought.
Though they were currently in an underground arena where rules didn’t apply, people still attached a lot of importance to the ritual surrounding mech duels. Any terms that flew wildly out of bounds would only make a mockery out of this sacred occasion. Basically, Captain Orfan wouldn’t be able to impose any ridiculous terms.
"First, we’ll hold our duel in three days. We haven’t received any prior notice to this challenge. A fight right now is too sudden for us."
"Agreed." Avid Serpent responded. "If you need to fortify your courage, then be my guest. It’s not my fault you are quaking in your boots."
"Hahahaha!"
Some of the crowd erupted into laughter.
"Second term, we fight in our own mechs."
"I do not agree! My axeman mech pales in comparison to your mech. Even though I’ve never seen your mech before, a mech captain is entitled to pilot the best. Would our duel be fair if your mech is at least thrice as valuable as mine?"
"Fair duel! Fair duel! Fair duel!"
"You idiot, you think a mech captain will choose to pilot a rustbucket?"
Overall, the crowd was swayed by Avid Serpent’s response. This was not a duel where mech pilots pitted their individual strength or the capabilities of their mech models. This was purely a contest of honor.
"Fine then! If the arena operators can lend me a spearman mech of the same value as her axeman mech, I’ll kick your butt regardless!"
Ves shot forward from his seat. "No! You idiot!"
"AGREED!" Some nameless man’s voice thundered from above as if it came from the will of heaven.
Something moved on the arena grounds. A section of the grounds retracted into the ground, then went back up. Surprisingly, the section now bore a partially-damaged lancer mech.
"Property of a deceased competitor. In line to be recycled." The voice spoke again but with less boom this time.
Orfan probably didn’t think much of the broken mech, but refusing now would put the arena operators in a bad light. "Adequate, though I’m not sure we can fix it up in time for the duel."
"Make do, then!" The challenger spat. "Are you not without support?"
Eventually, Captain Orfan and Avid Serpent hashed out a detailed agreement for the upcoming duel.
Word of the duel spread through the entire star system the next day. There wasn’t a mech enthusiast or professional in Harkensen that hadn’t heard of Avid Serpent’s challenge to the Flagrant Vandals.
Details of the terms of the upcoming duel proliferated among the public as well. The most noteworthy stipulation elevated the honor duel from a passing curiosity into the talk of the system.
"Fight to the death!"
"Accept no surrender!"
"Disable all escape mechanisms!"
"The winner shall only leave the arena grounds stained in blood!"
Though the public butchered the wording of the terms, they weren’t necessarily wrong. In order to prove their worth and uphold their deals, both duelists needed to show their sincerity. To an honor duel, there was nothing more convincing than to put their lives at stake.
The message they were trying to say was that even if they lost, they would rather accept death than dishonor!
How exciting!
Harkensen did nothing to prohibit the news. Why would they? The sensational duel only brought more tourists to their system! Drama like this promoted their cosmopolitan nature. Look at our star system! Only in a place where multiple nationalities and cultures clashed can you witness something as exciting as a duel to the death!
Not everyone approved of the duel, however. A small minority in the Harkensen System and a greater majority of people elsewhere regarded it as a barbaric tradition. A proper mech duel should be a civilized affair where the better of the two gracefully won while showing magnanimity to their opponent.
Fights to the death was as barbaric as two cavemen bashing their heads with a rock in order to determine who had the right to mate with the woman with the widest hips. Though the actual mech duelists were both women this time, that didn’t detract from the crude nature of the duel.
Although mech duels happened a lot, the MTA took a very dim view on them when they turned deadly. Still, most people regarded the powerful organization as a distant nanny and took no note of their rules in this area. The mech duel was sacred, and even the MTA had given up on enforcing the no-deaths rule a couple of hundred years ago.
As long as the participants agreed to the stipulation willingly, neither the government nor the MTA had any reason to step in. If the mech pilots had a deathwish, then so be it. It was no different from driving a shuttle into a star.
In a way, the apathy shown by the highest authorities reflected their helplessness against human nature. As much as the leaders attempted to shape human values, they couldn’t have it both ways.
Mech pilots bore the brunt in every war. Though many civilians and servicemen serving in auxiliary units lost their lives as well, by far mech pilots risked the most.
In order to motivate them to fight, the MTA and many states in turn chose to foster a warrior culture among their mech pilots. Honor, pride, glory and adoration were nothing but tools in the hands of the states that drove their mech pilots into deadly situations. Unlike money or material rewards, nebulous concepts such as honor and glory didn’t cost much to come into being.
A famous conqueror once said that a soldier would fight long and hard for a colored ribbon.
In the Age of Mechs, trillions of mech pilots fought to make a name for themselves. The MTA’s initial attempts at encouraging mech pilots to become the main sacrifice in the constant struggle between states went out of control. The warrior culture had taken a life of its own, and various rituals and customs sprung into being that otherwise seemed anachronistic to a civilization that long transcended its home planet.
Right now, Ves, Captain Orfan and Chief Haine sat in front of a desk in Major Verle’s temporary office on Harkensen III. The commanding officer looked sternly at Captain Orfan.
The woman calmly stared back at her superior. Her eyes reflected the strong conviction she held in the righteousness of her case.
Chief Haine sat as if this circus didn’t have anything to do with her. Although she was a card-carrying member of the Flagrant Vandals, mech technicians didn’t buy into the warrior culture as much. Her only job was to fix the mechs of their fighters. What happened after that was none of the grizzled chief technician’s concern.
As for Ves, he refused to waste a single minute of his time. Ever since the duel had been set, he went through some channels and obtained the design specifications of the spearman mech that Captain Orfan would ride into battle. Ves needed to deepen himself in the foreign design before he could come up with the appropriate repairs.
He really hated the short time limit. Couldn’t Captain Orfan be more considerate to the mech designers and mech technicians that prepared her battlegear?
"Alright." Major Verle started after giving up on the silent treatment. "Let me begin by asking you, Orfan. What gives you the right represent the honor of the Flagrant Vandals?"
"Sir!" She barked, making a good show at being a prim and proper Vandal. "When the Vesian issued her challenge, nobody spoke up. I felt compelled by my rank to stand up to her. I doubt any Vandal objected to my actions. The odds of another Vandal mech captain being present at that venue was very slim. Since I’m not only a mech captain but also one who specializes in landbound combat, there are only few among the Vandals who can do better."
Major Verle tapped his desk with his finger. "I will give you that. Nonetheless, hasn’t it occurred to any of you to contact me or send an emergency signal from your comms? Mr. Larkinson! You’re the smartest among the Vandals. Why did you overlook this option?"
"Uh, I have no excuse, sir!" Ves stammered. "I mentally overlooked this option because I’m too used to all the communication restrictions."
"Those restrictions are there to prevent our servicemen from broadcasting our movements and plans to the enemy." Verle spoke. "Right now, everyone and their mother knows our task force has stopped over in the Harkensen System. It makes little sense to maintain a total blackout when we aren’t on a mission right now. Use the options that are the most appropriate at hand. What is appropriate or not changes in each different situation. Don’t make this kind of oversight again. That goes for the two of you as well!"
"I wasn’t present at the underground arena, sir." Chief Haine replied with a touch of complaint.
As for Captain Orfan, she remained recalcitrant. "Sir, asking for instructions from above would paint the wrong picture. Avid Serpent asked for a Vandal who could stand up to her, and I bit the bullet and stood up. If I diverted my attention to my comm while everyone was looking at me, I’d be made into a laughing stock!"
"Your personal reputation doesn’t concern me! Not when you hijacked this mech duel to blow your own horn!" His lips curled into a frown. "My intention was to lay low and let everyone’s interest in us die down. Obviously, that’s shot to hell now. We’ve become the talk of the town and no amount of hiding will stop everyone from paying attention to us. What a great vacation. This wasn’t what I expected when I wanted everyone to take their mind off any battles."
"It’s not all bad, sir. Proving our mech regiment’s worth before the Reinaldans and the tourists will burnish our reputation! The Mech Corps and the Tally Divisions won’t be able to ignore us any longer!"
"I don’t care about that, captain!" Major Verle roared again. "Don’t presume to know our strategic priorities. You are only a battlefield mech captain. Other Vandal officers are responsible for any greater concerns. We do not need a mech officer who lets her fighting instincts do the thinking for her to take a leading position in our mech regiment."
The major tried to rein in his temper while the other three patiently waited for instructions. No matter what Major Verle thought about the duel, they could only go through with it now that it was set in stone.
"Alright, let’s move on to our approach. First, are you fully recovered from battle?"
"Hell, I’m raring to go at that Vesian wench, sir!" Captain Orfan enthusiastically declared.
"Are you even cleared for battle?"
"Hey, the mind doctors only repeated the usual stuff, major. I’m not depressed or hung up over our fallen brothers, if that was what you were worried about. There’s nothing wrong with my body, either."
With Orfan’s sheer force of personality, it was no wonder why she said so. Ves inwardly scoffed at the captain. In his eyes, she thought so much of herself that she hardly had any empathy left for others.
"Very well, I’ll take your word over it for now, but I’ll look up your medical reports right after this meeting. If you lied about anything, I’ll boot you from this duel and replace you with another captain. The Vesian challenged our entire mech regiment, so I doubt she would object to a shuffle."
Captain Orfan narrowed her eyes at her superior. It was as if she was wary of his intentions. The man ignored her stares and turned to Ves and Chief Haine.
"As for you two, you’re going to be responsible for fixing the spearman mech the arena operators dug out of their junk pile. Lay it down on me. How bad is the condition of the mech?"
"The spearman mech is a copy of a fairly popular Reinaldan mech model." Ves replied. It was his turn to answer Verle’s questions. "It’s condition isn’t as bad as it appears. It’s a little old and worn out and has a big hole in its torso, but it won’t take too much effort to get it up and running. All of its essential components are still in place, and what damage it suffered to its internals can be fixed up easily enough, sir."
"What’s the catch, then?"
"Well, I’m not entirely used to the Reinaldan mech standards. There are a few oddities our mech technicians and I have to get used to. The mech had been getting on in years and shows lots of signs of jury-rigged repairs. It’s basically a mass production model that has slowly degraded over the years before meeting its final end in the dueling grounds."
"Will you be able to fix it up in time for the duel?"
Ves grinned. "No question about it, sir. I’m not unaccustomed to working under pressure. I’ve prepared for several duels like this, and in my eyes, three days is enough for me to transform the mech into something new. Give me Chief Haine and a bunch of mech technicians and I can give you a prize-winning mech."
He held the utmost confidence in his mech design skills. Avid Serpent, perhaps wary of the strong support the Flagrant Vandals could provide to Captain Orfan, proposed detailed terms that limited the amount of work that could be done to their mechs.
While this limited what people and what kind of materials the Flagrant Vandals could employ to upgrade their assigned mech, the same limitations applied to Avid Serpent as well.
There was no way she would be on her own after issuing her challenge. Their mech duel had transcended their personal honor. While Captain Orfan fought for the Flagrant Vandals, Avid Serpent represented the entirety of the Mech Legion.
Any patriotic Vesian present in Harkensen would likely flock to Avid Serpent and lend a hand. If neither side limited the amount of help each side could receive, both duelists may soon be piloting extravagant mechs worth billions of credits. A mech duel that was supposed to revolve around honor would devolve into a contest between who could waste more resources than their counterparts.
The reason why Ves felt smug was because one of the terms that Avid Serpent had insisted upon played to his advantage. The term insisted that only a single mech designer on each side was allowed to assist in the preparation of their mechs, and they had to be Apprentices at most.
The terms proposed by Avid Serpent revealed that she only possessed a shallow understanding of the Flagrant Vandals. Someone who knew the Vandals intimately wouldn't put so many limitations on how much strength they could utilize to prepare for the upcoming mech duel.
An ordinary mech regiment employed up to a hundred high-ranked mech designers. Though most of them might only consist of talented Apprentices, perhaps a dozen Journeyman and a couple of Seniors sat at the top.
This was a terrifying concentration of mech design strength.
An average medium state-wide mech manufacturer only employed a couple of talented Apprentices or a single average Journeyman.
A large sector-wide mech manufacturer on the other hand may only employ up to fifty mech designers spread into various teams. Only the larger mech manufacturers employed Seniors. The smaller ones usually made do with Journeymen as their lead designers.
So from an outside perspective, employing several Seniors and more than a dozen Journeymen as well as a hundred Apprentices was massive overkill.
"That's exactly the point." Ves had learned after witnessing several different mech regiments in battle.
The two that stood out the most were the two premier mech regiments of the Mech Legion. Both the Calico Dancer Bats and the Frosty Meteors showed indomitable strength. In their battles against the Flagrant Vandals, despite showing up with a fraction of the numbers of the Flagrant Vandals, both Vesian units proved that they could punch above their weight.
Part of it was their centuries-long martial tradition. These famous names had been founded centuries ago, and they evolved from nothing into the elite step-by-step in their own unique style of fighting. This elevated their mech pilots into true soldiers that clearly surpassed the standard of an average mercenary.
Another part of their strength came from a straightforward expression of wealth and capability. Their mechs utilized many expensive materials that only the government could provide. The duchies weren't parsimonious with regard to their elite regiments. This wealth also allowed them to employ all of those high-ranking mech designers.
The Flagrant Vandals lacked that kind of accumulation. Their status within the Mech Corps was awkward, but this was only known from within and by a small circle of outsiders. To the public, the Flagrant Vandals appeared to be a genuine if eccentric extension of the Bright Republic's military.
This was why Ves felt a little bit more reassured about this challenge. At the moment Avid Serpent issued her challenge, she didn't appear to act as an agent of the Vesians. If the Vesian mech pilot had been an insider, then she wouldn't have been so hasty in ruling out assistance from Journeymen and Senior Mech Designers. She also wouldn't have prohibited external material assistance, though in this area the disparity was smaller.
In short, the terms of the mech duel sought to minimize the influence of outside factors and turn the occasion into a contest of individual strength. If the Reinaldan arena operators hadn't brought out a damaged spearman mech, the mech duel might have commenced right away!
"Avid Serpent has made a big mistake."
Ves knew his strength and considered himself to be highly placed among Apprentices. With his great foundation and his advantages from his Masteries, even after being separated from the System he still possessed capabilities beyond the average Apprentice.
"I don't know who Avid Serpent will turn to for help." He reminded himself.
Each side could employ any single mech designer they wished to enhance their dueling mechs. Both Avid Serpent and Captain Orfan had the right to pick out any Apprentice Mech Designer and a number of mech technicians to assist. They could draw on the underground arena's mech workshops to perform their work and draw upon a limited number of resources from their stockpiles or junkyard.
It was already set in stone that Ves and a number of mech technicians from the Vandals would work on Orfan's spearman mech. Regarding their own side, Ves had no question about their own strength.
As for the kind of help that Avid Serpent could expect, the Flagrant Vandals hadn't been able to find out as of yet. Several agents affiliated with the Bright Republic kept an eye on where Avid Serpent currently resided. They spotted many prominent Vesians entering her room.
Because the mech duel involved the honor of the Vesia Kingdom, there was no question that Avid Serpent could have her pick of Vesian talents. While the Kingdom had a tenuous relationship with the Reinald Republic, officially they were at peace with each other. The Reinaldans didn't prohibit any Vesian visitors, and many did in fact paid a visit to the Harkensen System.
Right now, Ves, Chief Haine, Captain Orfan and a gaggle of mech technicians traveled to the underground arena. Even in the morning, the fighting venue already opened its doors, though only a fourth of the seats were occupied at this time.
"Captain Orfan! Please come this way!" An arena manager called from the side.
The entourage followed the manager to an elevator that brought the Vandals to the lower levels. Once the elevator reached the right floor, they stepped out and walked through a wide mech-sized corridor.
The manager briefly introduced this floor. "This is our workshop area. It consists of thirty halls, each of which has enough space and equipment to service any third-class mech."
"What about second-class mechs?" Ves asked.
"Our apologies, but the variety of mechs that duelists bring to our venue mostly consist of lower-end mechs. There has never been a case where a mech pilot from the Coalition entered the dueling ground with an expensive second-class mech. Mech pilots from second-rate states generally disdain our class of establishments."
The manager spoke those words without any resentment or animosity because it was the bare truth. Having a second-class mech compete in this local underground arena was like putting a warhorse into a pigsty. The disparity was too big, and the consequences of damaging a second-class mech and its mech pilot was dreadful.
"I see." Ves nodded. "Will we have access to a complete suite of mech manufacturing equipment, or do we have to make due with the bare essentials?"
"It's the latter, unfortunately. Compressed armor is too expensive for both our organization and our mech athletes to maintain on a regular basis. It also unnecessarily prolongs the duels, turning them into hitting matches where the side that hits a little harder will win the match."
The underground arena didn't prohibit the use of compressed armor, but the owner of the mechs needed to bear the full cost of repairs by themselves without any assistance from the operators. This could turn out to be very expensive if the mech incurred a lot of damage.
"So neither our captain or Avid Serpent will be able to bring a mech clad in compressed armor to the duel?"
"That's correct. Please be assured that we will endeavor to provide the exact same amount of accommodation to each of you. Let it not be said that we are partial to one side over the other.
Mech arenas relied on a reputation for impartiality to attract a ceaseless amount of audience members and mech athletes. This applied double to underground arenas, as they weren't shackled to any laws. Fudging the outcome of the duels was trivially easy if the arena operators possessed no morals.
Once news of such manipulation leaked out, the mech arena in question lost all of their credibility. In this business, credibility was extremely precious. Once it was lost, it could never be regained.
Thus, the manager went out of his way to explain how fair they set up their preparations. Neither side should have any complaints about favor one side over another.
This suited Ves fine. "If our circumstances are truly as you have described, then I have nothing to say."
After reaching the end of the corridor, they arrived at their assigned workshop. Before everyone entered, they stared at the entrance of the workshop on the opposite side. They weren't the first to reach this location.
"Vandals." A masked and robed woman spat as she beheld the recent arrivals. "Come to prepare for your doom?"
"Hah!" Captain Orfan laughed and stepped forward. "Look who's barking up our legs! What's the matter? Why don't you show us your face? Are you too ugly or something?"
"Hmph!" Avid Serpent huffed and turned her back on the captain. "Engaging in a conversation with a boastful pig like you is a waste of time."
Avid Serpent masked her identity quite well, but her mannerisms revealed peculiar aspects about her personality. When Ves carefully probed her with his spiritual sense, he faintly encountered a strong force of will.
It lacked the sense of realness that Ves had experienced before from an unconscious Venerable Foster, so Ves was pretty sure that Avid Serpent was not an expert. This was good news for all of them. The Vandals dreaded many possibilities, of which one of them was that Avid Serpent played the pig to eat the tiger. His probing ruled out this possibility.
Ves turned his gaze to the people that Avid Serpent had admitted into her circle. The mech technicians looked like a mixed bunch. None of them appeared to be cut from the same cloth, which meant their teamwork should be low, though their individual ability may certainly be better than the average Vandal mech technician.
"Ah, the famous Mr. Larkinson!" A middle-aged man stepped out. "As one mech designer to another one, I hope we can
"You've heard of me." Ves said with a befuddled face.
"How can we not. Word has spread how pivotal you have proven to be in several Vandal battles. Head Designer Larkinson. The only Apprentice Mech Designer to assume a position that only Journeymen should take. How odd for the Vandals to favor you so? Is it because of your family?"
"I have my ways." Ves said cryptically while narrowing his eyes.
Information like that shouldn't have spread to the public. He highly preferred to stay in the background. The less the other side knew about him, the better. Obviously, this hope was shot to hell right now.
"I hope you can showcase your splendor three days from now. I'm eager to see if my work can measure up to the efforts of a head designer."
"You have me at a disadvantage. Would you be so kind to introduce yourself?"
"Ah, where are my manners. My name is Gabriel Creta. I am apprenticed to Master Renona Klaisewist of the Mech University of Loge Imodris."
Ves had never heard of Gabriel Creta, but his eyes widened when the man dropped the names of Renona Klaisewist and the Mech University of Loge Imodris.
Renona Klaisewist was a seasoned Master Mech Designer and lived over two-hundred years according to the public record. She specialized in force application, which meant she designed exquisite mechs that made the most out of their mechanical strength.
Any melee mechs designed from her hand demonstrated extreme destructiveness with every attack!
Ves regarded Mr. Creta without any of his former contempt. Though Ves was unsure of Creta's exact relationship with Master Klaisewist, any apprentice of hers should have inherited some of her best design principles.
In addition, Creta may very well be an alumni of Loge Imodris. The famed Mech University was one of the best in the Kingdom. It enjoyed just as much prestige in the Vesia Kingdom as the Ansel University of Mech Design in the Bright Republic. Both were regularly mentioned in the same sentence.
The status Gabriel Crete enjoyed from both would surely be considerate. Along with his age advantage over Ves, and he may very well prove to be a hard bone to gnaw.
Nevertheless, Ves did not shy away from the challenge.
"I am eager to see what an apprentice of Master Klaisewist can teach me." Ves smiled in a facetious manner.
"Likewise." Mr. Crete nodded back with an unruffled expression. "Master Carmin Olson's sudden rise has disrupted the high end mech landscape in the region. I am eager to see what scraps of knowledge that she has thrown to you."
After Captain Orfan and Avid Serpent finished exchanging insults with each other, they both entered their assigned workshops along with their followers.
As soon as they entered, they commanded the massive mech-sized doors to shut. There was no reason to let their opponents gawk at their progress.
"Alright, what’s up with you, Mr. Larkinson?" Captain Orfan asked. She hadn’t missed his exchange with their rival mech designer.
"Well, this isn’t going to be a walk in the park for me." Ves answered as he started searching the man’s biography on the galactic net. "I don’t know where Avid Serpent has found him, but she picked a good mech designer at the Apprentice-level. The only way she could top her choice was if she accepted the help of a direct disciple of a Master Mech Designer."
Such august figures shouldn’t be mucking about in the Harkensen System. They had better things to do with their time than interact with the low-end mechs favored by mercenaries and pirates.
His brief search on Gabriel Creta turned up a lot of pages that confirmed his status. The man was a seasoned mech designer who ran a successful mech business that offered a complete line of mech models in its catalog.
In terms of business, Creta was far ahead of Ves. The man built up his company step-by-step, never ceasing to develop new mech models to round out his company’s existing products.
"Is there anything I should know about this fellow?"
Ves thought about it. Though the man ran a larger business than him, the evaluation of his designs showed that his skills hadn’t grown as fast. "Mr. Creta is older, but his Master hadn’t taught him much. In that regard, we’re on a similar level. His specialty is something that we have to be wary of. Though I’m not certain yet of his strengths, he will doubtlessly excel at working with melee mechs. In particular, he should be extremely good at maximizing the force application of his mechs."
Captain Orfan scratched her head. "Can you translate that into normal words?"
"It basically means his mechs hit really hard and their movements will be really powerful. Both the arms and legs are going to be really strong by the time he is done with them. Force application entails more than that, but you don’t need to know that."
It would be a joke if a vaunted Master’s specialty only resulted in stronger arms and legs. That was a massive oversimplification of what a supreme insight into force application could do for a mech designer.
Fortunately, Ves was fairly certain that Mr. Creta shouldn’t have mastered the more abstruse uses of force application. That went well beyond the ability of an Apprentice Mech Designer. This was also why Ves didn’t bother to elaborate the concept.
"So this is the mech we have to fix up?" Chief Haine asked as she stepped towards the spearman mech placed in the center of the workshop. "Man, it looks as if the Reinaldans fished it out of a junkyard."
"That’s because you’re right. This is a rejected piece of scrap that the arena operators planned to recycle at a later date."
Ves already studied the design of the spearman mech in detail. It was an old Reinaldan design called the INSF-8088-CS Pointed Sentinel.
Designed by Ophidian-Wheelax Industries, the mech was a typical low-cost design whose only purpose was to earn a quick buck. OWI was a small player in the Reinaldan mech market, and it had only reached the status of medium mech manufacturer after merging two smaller mech manufacturers.
The Pointed Sentinel was in fact a collaboration between the two joint lead designers of OWI. The pair somehow avoided most of the pitfalls of collaborate design work and managed to fuse both of their strengths into a single harmonious design. The Pointed Sentinel possessed little flaws and performed adequately at its price point of 40 million marks or around 20 million bright credits.
However, this description already hinted at its fatal flaw. While the design possessed various strengths and weaknesses, the former was very nuanced. Put in a different way, the design didn’t excel in anything. It was a bog-standard spearman mech design with mediocre specs and nothing special to write home about.
Ves suspected that this may have been a result of two lead designers trying to push their own conflicting vision for the design. Of neither of them agreed to put one or the other in charge, both of them had to make constant compromises in order to finish the design.
The final result of the Pointed Sentinel showed that putting two mech designers in charge of the same design led to overly conservative design choices. It received a small amount of criticism that mentioned this shortcoming when the design first came out.
The only reason why the design hadn’t received more criticism was because the Ophidian-Wheelax Industries was an obscure player in the mech market. Up to now, they never broke through their shackles and experienced any growth. This already showcased their overall level of competence.
To be honest, Ves didn’t really put the Pointed Sentinel in his eyes. Compared to the mech designs he worked with before such as the Inheritor, Hellcat and Akkara designs, the Pointed Sentinel was a throwback to his earlier career. It lacked the complexity and optimization of more successful mech models.
Ves briefly explained all of this to Captain Orfan. "To be honest, the Pointed Sentinel can’t keep up with your level of skill. You’ll constantly be fighting for control and push your machine past its limits. Compared to the mech you’re used to piloting, the Pointed Sentinel’s speed, flexibility and reaction time are only half as good."
"So it’s literally a piece of junk."
"It.. has its limitations." He conceded. "The only upside is that Avid Serpent’s axeman mech falls into the same category as well. They are both meant to be affordable mechs that is supposed to deliver a good price-to-performance ratio. In that, they succeeded, in a sense. It’s a decent mech to buy when you only have 40 million credits to spend when it first came out."
Both designs have depreciated over the years, though. Though they were both currentgen mechs, thousands of designs have popped up that directly competed against them in the same market segment.
A mech design that failed to make a splash and quickly fell into obscurity obviously lacked a redeeming quality. They were too generic and too mediocre. A decent price-to-performance ratio wasn’t enough to stand out in the market. It needed an advantage that was memorable in order to stand the test of time.
From the start, Ves had always designed his production models with an eye towards long-term appeal. No mech was perfect. While it was true that mech designers inevitably had to make compromises with their design choices, that only applied to situations where their means couldn’t catch up to their vision.
For example, wanting to design a mech clad with compressed armor, but lacking an alloy compressor. In such a situation, a mech designer could only take a step back and design a mech with cheaper armor.
What the lead designers of OWI had done was to make too many compromises with the design of the Pointed Sentinel. Defaulting to the safest design choices all the time led to a safe but timid design that never attempted to challenge the competition.
No wonder this design failed from the start. From what Ves had gathered from the galactic net, the Pointed Sentinel barely sold at full price. OWI had to issue regular discounts and conclude various unfavorable deals in order to prevent their mechs from collecting dust in their inventories.
"I’ve piloted many crappy mechs in my career." Captain Orfan said. "It’s a long time ago since I last stepped into a cockpit of a mech as worthless as this. I’ll have to shake off some of my rust. There’s a simulator pod around here, right?"
"Ves jerked at the pod shoved to the side of the workshop. "It’s over there. However, I don’t suggest you grow too familiar with the Pointed Sentinel’s level of performance. Even as we are going to repair your dueling mech, we’ll also going to apply a whole host of upgrades."
"How big of an upgrade are we talking about?"
"It depends, captain. I’ll have to look at the materials the arena organizers are willing to part with to be sure. However, my most conservative estimate is that I can likely boost your Pointed Sentinel’s performance by fifteen percent."
Captain Orfan whistled at that figure. "Fifteen percent? That’s a lot!"
"It’s mainly because the Pointed Sentinel is an old and suboptimal design. Though I don’t have enough time to remedy every issue, elevating its overall performance by fifteen percent while plugging most of the gaps shouldn’t be too much of an issue."
"Good luck, then!"
The mech captain turned out to be an impatient client. Ever since she laid her eyes on the simulator, she never wavered her gaze. She quickly brushed Ves off before he could list a couple of possible upgrade priorities and hopped into the simulator pod.
Ves sighed. "Can you at least answer my questions?"
"Don’t worry about it, Ves." Chief Haine stepped closer to him. "I’m familiar with Captain Orfan’s preferences. I know what she wants in a mech."
"Thank you. Can you briefly tell me about her piloting style?"
Haine put a finger on her lips. "I don’t know how to describe it. For someone like Captain Orfan, her piloting style is a little chaotic."
"How so?"
"Sometimes, I wonder whether she knows what she is doing. The captain isn’t incapable foresight. She can plan and write out reports as well as any other mech captain. It’s just that when she’s on the battlefield, she directly throws out half of her burdens from her brains. Her intelligence basically halves when she fights."
Ves frowned at that. Even if Chief Haine exaggerated her depiction of the mech captain, his personal experiences with the captain didn’t allow him to disregard this description entirely.
"How did she ever get promoted to a mech captain then?"
The chief technician shrugged. "That’s the Flagrant Vandals for you. We can’t be too picky on who we decide to promote. I think that in the past, the brass wanted to promote champions who could fight well to serve as anchors for the mech companies under our command. Captain Orfan may be lacking in some manners, but she’s truly one of our better landbound mech pilot. That alone deserves some respect."
Ves inwardly rolled his eyes. "Respect. Yes. Anyway, you haven’t described her piloting style in detail. Can you give me something to work with? I need concrete descriptions."
"The captain is capable of being patient when she’s on the hunt. Once she finds an opponent her subordinates can’t easily solve, she explodes into action. She loves to pressure her opponents with high-intensity combat. Very aggressive, but also very much in control despite lacking much forethought. She’s the kind of mech pilot that relies on her instincts rather than her mind to see her through a battle."
"So she’s a wild beast in battle, then." Ves palmed his face. "These kind of mech pilots are some of the worst to work with as a mech designer or a mech technician."
Ves had seen many of these kinds of mech pilots among the Vandals and Walter’s Whalers. They usually didn’t survive long enough to make it to the rank of captain, so it was very surprising for Rosa Orfan to succeed where many others have failed.
Mech pilots like Orfan exhibited strong battle instincts. This was an advantage in terms of high-speed combat where quick thinking could never catch up to pure instinct. However, the downside to relying on instincts was that the mech pilot never paid much attention to the status of their mechs. They outright ignored most of the information displayed in the control panels such as how much heat their mechs built up or how fast they depleted their energy cells.
Basically, they turned out to be some of the most abusive pilots to their own mechs.
Overall, Ves faced a serious challenge of his own. The base design of the Pointed Sentinel truly couldn’t catch up with Captain Orfan. Considering her personality, she wouldn’t be able to hold herself back too much.
If she piloted the Pointed Sentinel after it received only the most essential repairs, then she would do much more damage to her own mech than her opponent could ever inflict.
"Captain Orfan is her mech’s worst enemy."
It sounded like a ludicrous statement, but instances like this happened many times before. Countless stories proliferated on the galactic net on how skilled mech pilots met their own end after transferring from a high-quality mech to a low-quality mech.
This showcased a fundamental truth. There should never be too much disparity between the strength of a mech and the strength of the mech pilot. Why do expert pilots insist on piloting extremely expensive custom mechs?
Because they would otherwise break their own mechs!
The newly advanced Venerable Foster obviously struggled with this issue herself. Her old training mech which served her adequately started breaking down as soon as she broke through. Evoking forced resonance only put more pressure on the frame, as her mech’s vastly increased power came with a subsequent tradeoff of accelerating the consumption of its lifespan.
It could be said that the quality of a mech determined the upper limit on the skill that mech pilots would be able to display. Those who possessed more ability would inevitably brush against the limits of what their mechs could perform. Therefore, it was vitally important to match the power of a mech with the upper limits of a mech pilot’s skill.
Ves keenly understood this point, and so did many others. Why did Walter’s Whalers used to buy second-hand trash mech worth 3 million bright credits or less? It was because the average skill of their mech pilots was absolutely abysmal.
Straight-up investing money in better mechs didn’t necessarily improve the strength of the Whalers either. If Walter handed over mechs worth 30 million credits to his badly-trained mech pilots, the actual strength they could express may only be equivalent to the power of a mech worth 10 million credits or less.
"The strength of a mech pilot must be proportional to the strength of a mech!"
Of course, this statement wasn’t absolute. There were many ways of strengthening a mech without overly burdening the mech pilot. The easiest way to cheat this rule was to strengthen a mech’s armor. Many armor formulas shared the same attributes in terms of weight and density, but they differ dramatically in the amount of protection they offered. This was mainly a function of the quantity and quality of exotics they utilized.
This was also the most important point of difference between third-class mechs and second-class mechs and etc. Third-class mechs utilized a much lower standard of armor formulas than second-class mechs. The cost of second-class mechs may easily be tens to hundreds of times more than a third-class mech, but their armor may easily be five to ten times stronger.
Of course, the amplification of strength constantly bumped into the law of diminishing returns. A mech that was twice as expensive may only be ten or so percent stronger in reality.
This made it uneconomical for third-rate states to imitate the standard of mechs employed by the vastly richer second-rate states.
In any case, right now Ves had to work with a third-class low-end mech. In his eyes, every mech that costs less than 30 million credits was a budget mech, and the Pointed Sentinel fell squarely in this category.
The mech industry produced budget mechs en masse. Why not? The private market hungered for them. The skill, training and aptitude of the majority of the mech pilots in the private sector matched well with budget mechs. They would never be able to get their money’s worth if they piloted an expensive premium mech such as the LMC’s Bleakbeak or Crystal Lord.
Ves explicitly designed his original mech designs towards squad leaders, champions, mercenary commanders and the like. Possessing the ability of an advanced pilot was the basic qualification to pilot his mechs, because they both came with lots of strength and highly sophisticated control mechanisms that average pilots would never be able to use to their full potential.
This limited his customer base, but Ves had never intended to compete with budget mechs. Due to their low cost, the barrier for entry in that market was far too low. Too many mech designers plunged into that market already.
Though there were lots of risks involved with plunging straight into the premium segment, his ability and his high-quality work had pulled him through. The LMC stood on a firm foundation thanks to his good judgement and previous hard work.
His private sector experience provided him with lots of experience on what skilled advanced pilots demanded out of their mechs.
On the other hand, his experiences with several outfits such as Walter’s Whalers and the Flagrant Vandals gave him a better perspective on what basic mech pilots asked out of their mechs.
The gap between basic pilots and advanced pilots was actually fairly wide. A mismatch in mechs and pilots between the two basic categories might prove disastrous.
In the case of Captain Orfan, her instinct-driven piloting style magnified that small possibility into certain catastrophe.
When Ves explained his train of thoughts to Chief Haine, she nodded in understanding. "Can’t say I’ve bumped into this issue a lot, but I’ve seen some cases like that over the years. The thing is, you’re asking us to upgrade a mech from something that is suitable for basic pilots into a machine that can handle the stress outputted by a peak advanced pilot. Even if you are a Journeyman Mech Designer in all but name, we’ve only got three days to work with before we have to send the Pointed Sentinel onto the arena grounds."
Her skepticism was justified. Even Ves didn’t fully believe he could accomplish this ambitious goal in so little time.
"Do you believe in miracles?" Ves asked with a grin.
"There’s no such thing as miracles."
"Well, I’ll make you a believer in the next three days. There’s nothing we can’t do as long as we take a clever approach."
"You can’t forget about your opponent either." The chief reminded Ves. "You witnessed Avid Serpent’s mech in battle, right? That’s precious information that you can use to implement countermeasures in your own mech."
"You’re right. I was thinking so much about what I can do with the Pointed Sentinel that I haven’t considered the other side."
By now, Ves had gathered a basic amount of information about his opponent. He not only knew what Gabriel Creta was capable of, but he also studied the basic background of the mech that Avid Serpent piloted.
Her axeman mech was a slightly more modern Vesian design called the Rogue Breaker. It used to come with a two-handed axe, but Avid Serpent’s copy wielded a one-handed axe instead.
The Rogue Breaker happened to be designed by a Hafner mech designer, which strongly indicated that Avid Serpent came from the same territory. This also explained her personal affront to the Flagrant Vandals. Only Imodris and Hafner suffered a drastic drop in reputation due to their actions.
"The Rogue Breaker is an offensive mech." Ves explained to the chief. "It’s overall parameters are actually a notch above the Pointed Sentinel. The only areas where our mech possesses an advantage is armor and endurance."
This was not good news to them. According to the Vandal mech pilots that witnessed her in battle, Avid Serpent was definitely an advanced pilot. It was questionable whether she was an officer-level mech pilot, but in terms of intuition and skills, she wouldn’t be much worse than Captain Orfan.
The more important issue was that the Rogue Breaker possessed a higher tolerance for abuse from their own mech pilots. Its internal frame and mechanical structure was more robust, and its overall agility and flexibility enabled it to perform high-speed maneuvers with much less strain on the integrity of the mech.
Put simply, the Rogue Breaker accommodated advanced pilots much better than the Pointed Sentinel. Both of them were budget mechs, but their design principles took completely different directions.
"I don’t know how Avid Serpent originally got her hands on the Rogue Breaker, but it certainly fits her well enough." Ves unabashedly praised his opponent. "Mr. Creta doesn’t need to overhaul too many systems to draw out the potential of that axeman mech. As for us, we’ll have to tear out at least half the Pointed Sentinel’s frame before we can do anything more."
Chief Haine possessed a rich experience. When she heard his words, she looked suspiciously at him. "I get the feeling that you’re about to do something ambitious."
"Heh, let’s visit the inventory and junkyard before I explain."
Ves and the Chief exited the workshop and asked an arena manager to bring them to the places where they could draw their working materials. The manager led them through the huge but largely unadorned corridors until they entered a massive warehouse area.
"This is our main storage hall." The manager explained with pride. "We regularly stockpile the most common materials used by the mech models that we regularly see on the dueling field. As agreed, you are allowed to draw upon a limited quota of materials for your restoration work. The maximum quota is limited by the cost of materials. For example, you can draw upon tons of plain alloys, but only a handful of junk exotics."
"That’s fair enough." Ves nodded. The underground arena didn’t operate a charity. "I’m very satisfied with your stockpile."
He could draw upon a great variety of materials from the stockpile, including ones he previously used in his production models. His familiarity with these materials allowed him to apply them to his work without worrying about any complications.
"Do you wish to make use of your quota?"
"I’m not in a hurry. Show me the junkyard."
The three left the underground warehouse and walked a short distance before they arrived at a massive pit. Piles and piles of broken mechs, burned-out husks and separated parts rested in the pit. Heavy-duty cranes, lifters and other machinery enabled the arena organization to quickly dump and retrieve their wrecks.
"That’s a lot of mech wrecks." Chief Haine widened her eyes. "All of this is untapped value. Why haven’t you sent them to the recyclers?"
"Many of these remains hold unclear providence. Their ownership is rather troublesome." The manager shook his head with regret. "Many mech pilots that compete in our arena don’t own the mechs they are piloting. Instead, they use a variety of means to get their hands on a battle machine. Sometimes they rent them from a rental company. Sometimes they ask a friend to borrow their personal mech. If there’s a way, someone will doubtlessly make use of it. Ordinarily, there won’t be much of an issue of the mech duelist wins, but a loss is more complex."
Those who lost likely had to face massive repair bills. If they didn’t own the mech, then they had no reason to foot the bill. As for those who outright died in battle, it might be difficult to track down the actual owners of the mech.
All of these complications forced the organization to hold on to the mechs, whether they were intact or not. The arena stored the mechs in better condition elsewhere. Only the mechs and parts in the worst conditions would be relegated to the junk pile.
"Does the organization mind if we appropriate some of these wrecks and parts?" Ves asked. This was a very important question that directly determined the viability of his plan.
"Our bosses don’t care." The manager shrugged. "You can do whatever you want with the junk as long as you’re using it reasonably."
"So there’s no quota?"
"None."
"Fantastic!"
Ves looked at the piles of mechs placed haphazardly on top of each other as if they were mountains of money. All of these wrecks represented untapped wealth. The manager and Chief Haine looked as Ves as if he had gone crazy. What did he want to do with junk?
Chief Haine figured it out first. "You never intended to stick to the Pointed Sentinel’s original design!"
"Exactly." Ves confirmed her guess with a perpetual grin. "Even if I designed a variant of the Pointed Sentinel that can make up for some of its weaknesses, its foundation is too weak! Rather than limiting ourselves to the shackles of the base model, why not break it apart and free it from mediocrity?"
"Are you crazy, Mr. Larkinson?! Do you know the immensity of what you are aiming to accomplish? You’re too ambitious! I wouldn’t be surprised if you chose to go this route if we had a month’s worth of time to tackle the problems that crop up slowly, but you only have three days time!"
Ves took her reproach without any sign of relenting. This was going to be one of his most challenging projects to date. In truth, his ambitious was indeed very wild, but his past competition experience already showed him that he could work under pressure.
He planned to take the Pointed Sentinel, disassemble it into pieces, and substitute its lesser parts with those from the junkyard!
A mech that deviated from any known design by a very wide margin wouldn’t be called a variant anymore. If Ves intended to go through with his plan to assemble an entirely different machine from parts of different mech models, then he was basically building a frankenstein mech!
Frankenstein mechs went far beyond patchwork mechs. The latter only filled up some of their holes with inadequate replacement parts. The former completely represented a new and divergent mech model that possessed only a vague relationship with the original design.
To design and assemble a frankenstein mech took a lot of guts! Mixing and matching wildly incompatible mech parts took a lot of skill, especially since every mech designer adhered to their own standards. Some commonalities would be shared among mechs from the same state, but beyond that every mech model comprised of its own system.
Rashly combining parts from different mech models would be like trying to push a square block through a round hole. The parts fundamentally couldn’t mate with each other. Even if Ves forced a connection through brute force, the parts all ran on different settings and programming. Trying to harmonize all of those complexities into a coherent whole took a lot of time.
Where would Ves be able to find the time to harmonize the programming?
"You’re taking an undue amount of risk for something that might go very bad." The chief warned Ves. "In my judgement, the chance of failure is over ninety percent. That’s way too risky to consider this option. We have other alternatives."
"And what are those options? Repairing the Pointed Sentinel? Making minor adjustments? Replacing some of its lesser components with better quality ones?" Ves retorted. "That doesn’t go far enough. If you understand the design of the Pointed Sentinel as well as I do, you’ll know that it simply can’t compete against the Rogue Breaker, especially after Mr. Creta is done with it. Playing it safe will lead to near-certain defeat in my eyes. In a time like this, the riskier option may be the only viable path to victory."
The regular courses of actions didn’t cut it to Ves. They didn’t go far enough in transforming the Pointed Sentinel from a bargain bin mech into a machine that could fully keep up with Captain Orfan’s piloting standard.
Chief Haine didn’t look convinced. "Even if you’re the head designer, you’re not in charge around here. Captain Orfan has put her life on the line for this honor duel, so she should have the final say. I won’t agree to something as drastic as building a frankenstein mech without her express approval."
"That’s fair enough." Ves acquiesced.
Even though he fully believed his judgement was right, it wasn’t his life on the line here. Though he had a limitless amount of plans in his mind, even he sometimes forgot that mech designers ought to serve mech pilots rather than the other way around.
Ves and the Chief returned to the workshop and waited until Captain Orfan paused her simulation battle. She emerged from the pod with an annoyed expression.
"What is it?"
"It’s like this."
Both of them explained their intentions to the captain. Chief Haine presented the safer while Ves elaborated on his wild scheme to construct a frankenstein mech.
The captain appeared impassive throughout the explanations. "Look at the results of my simulation battles."
She pressed a button on her half-open pod that summoned a projection of the outcome of the most recent battles. During the time that Ves and Chief Haine explored the inventory and junkyard, she completed over five simulations.
The captain lost in all of the scenarios. Ves read through the readout and saw that she not only tried out the Pointed Sentinel in a dueling environment, but also in large-scale battlefields which the captain was accustomed to. None of those situations ended well for her, and after reading the brief summaries of how her virtual mechs met their ends, he knew why.
"This ain’t the time to pussy-foot around." The captain said. "I’ve been wrangling with this piece of crap in five separate simulations and I barely made any progress. Do you know how difficult it is for me to rein in my power? It’s awful!"
"We can make focused improvements into increasing the upper limits of the parts."
"No can’t do, chief. That’s not good enough for me. A piece of crap is a piece of crap whether you polish it or not. If I knew how bad this stupid Sentinel really performed, I would have asked for another mech!"
"So you approve of my plan then, captain?" Ves looked hopefully at Orfan. He had a decent read on her personality. That was why he felt daring enough to think about building a frankenstein mech. Ordinary mech pilots would never think of piloting such a monstrosity.
"If you can deliver on your promises, then go for it!" The captain grinned. "Risky or not, I’d rather pilot something completely new than whatever variant of the stupid Sentinel you can come up with. Beating Avid Serpent is going to be impossible if my mech is too sluggish!"
Once Captain Orfan agreed with Ves, Chief Haine knew her arguments didn’t stand a chance. What Ves proposed matched her intentions better than a more conservative approach. The two looked as thick as thieves as they hashed out a set of criteria the frankenstein mech had to meet.
"First off, the new mech as to keep up with your movements." Ves repeated. "This is the first priority on my list."
"I’m not a speed freak, but I need to react fast and fluidly if I face a close-combat maniac like Avid Serpent."
"Noted. I’ll prioritize reaction speed and agility over top speed and flexibility."
Reaction speed and agility basically described how fast the limbs of a mech responded to the commands of a mech pilot. Heavy mechs notoriously scored badly in both. It might take several seconds for a heavy mech to lift a single leg forward. This was because the engine of the mech couldn’t keep up with the increase in weight of what was being moved.
Light mechs moved faster because the engine needed to do a lot less work in proportion. This was like the difference between swinging around a dagger and a greatsword. Someone could perform ten swings with a dagger by the time they completed a single slash with a greatsword.
Right now, Captain Orfan didn’t care too much about power. Between a dagger and a greatsword, she would rather be wielding a nimble weapon than a more powerful one that could crush an enemy in a single hit.
"Avid Serpent is a slippery pilot." She explained. Orfan hadn’t been sleeping during Avid Serpent’s duel with Broken Claw. "Her mech and piloting style leans towards power. Getting hit even once by that axe will instantly cripple whatever it hits. Her mech is also somewhat fast and agile for a medium mech."
Ves concurred with her analysis. "Those are my thoughts as well. The Rogue Breaker is fully committed to offense. Its armor isn’t bad, but it’s definitely compromised in order to increase the axeman mech’s offensive power."
"Since Avid Serpent’s mech doesn’t have a lot of armor, I don’t see why my mech needs a lot of power. I can handle a mech with a little less power."
This was a very good tradeoff to make in his eyes. "I’m glad we can agree on this. Now that I’ve noted down your demands, I’d like to get to work."
"Go ahead, but keep me informed!"
Orfan quickly returned to her simulator while Ves and Chief Haine walked away. The chief shook her head. "I should have expected that."
"Well, her decision is set in stone, so we better get off to work!"
They already wasted some time exploring their options, so Ves was quick to begin his plan. Building the frankenstein mech in three days was going to be a very tall order for him. He couldn’t take a conventional approach to its design because it wasted too much time.
He couldn’t only attempt do make up the design as he went! Though he already formed a vague vision of his intended outcome, the exact shape of the mech was still beneath a fog.
Ves wasn’t used to working on a mech without a concrete vision of the result. Every time he designed a mech, he carved out a solid vision right from the start and never wavered in his attempt to make it come to life.
Still, he believed he was capable enough to adjust his work methods. The X-Factor didn’t necessarily rely on a solid vision. It could work just as well on a vaguer premise as long as Ves constructed the appropriate images to override the mixed spirituality embedded in the different parts of the mech.
Ves already knew enough about the Pointed Sentinel’s design to know which parts needed replacing. He immediately returned to the junkyard and started dumpster diving for parts.
"Look for a good pair of medium mech legs that emphasizes agility over power." He told the chief. "If I have to do this alone, we’ll be stuck here for a while."
Both of them started to scour the wrecks and parts in the junkyard. To determine which parts needed closer consideration, they didn’t look at them in the junk pile. They instead sorted through projections of the parts from the control panel installed next the junkyard. The arena organization hadn’t thrown in all that junk without documenting what they dumped. Their record-keeping was meticulous, and they even measured all of the damage that had been incurred due to rough handling.
Ves closely sought for pairs of arms and legs. The two pairs of limbs formed the foundation of his frankenstein mech. As long as he made his selection, he could match them with additional parts that worked best with these limbs.
Within a single hour, Ves salvaged a pair of arms from a Lisvian spearman mech. He also dug up two separate leg parts that came from two different mechs of the same model.
Their condition was very important. While they didn’t need to be pristine, they should at least be complete. Ves didn’t know how many parts he rejected because were filled with holes and other signs of destruction.
Based on the body of the Pointed Sentinel and the parameters of the newly selected arms and legs, Ves picked up a host of other components. He picked out a new engine, power reactor, a whole pile of internal structure supports, internal frame rods, and more.
The most radicular parts he picked up required opening up an entire wreck. He salvaged the complete set of artificial musculature from the insides of another fallen spearman mech!
Chief Haine couldn’t believe that Ves was confident enough to transplant artificial musculature optimized for another mech model into his new frankenstein mech! To attempt such a thing was madness!
Ves and the mech technicians at his disposal began to transform the Pointed Sentinel mech immediately. In order to meet the three-day deadline, Ves had to take an expedited approach to building the new mech.
"Taking a sequential approach takes too much time." Chief Haine said. "Just tell us what we need to do and I’ll send enough techs to finish the job."
"Hm." He nodded as he eyed the frame of the Pointed Sentinel and the parts he dug up from the junkyard. "I still need to figure out how to piece together the frankenstein mech, but that doesn’t mean you have to wait on me. First, I want you to disassemble the Pointed Sentinel into complete parts, or as much as you are able to. Make a shallow inspection of all the parts and mark out those with issues."
"What about the junkyard parts? Even if we picked the best that we could find, not all of them are in great condition."
"Allocate some men into prepping them for use. Clean them up and make a more thorough inspection. The integrity of those parts are very important. We can’t afford to make use of something that looks pretty on the outside but is rotting from within."
The swarm of mech technicians quickly split up in teams. While each of them was an independent person, right now they acted as an extension of his will. Ves felt some of his Spirituality at work. It left its brand on the parts through the efforts of the mech technicians.
Though it wasn’t as good as handling the work by his own hand, this was much more convenient. "Achieving similar results through different means. It’s not there yet, but one day I’ll be stronger."
The mech technicians only siphoned away a portion of his Spirituality. The more precise his orders, the better the mech technicians grasped his intentions.
"Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to work when I’m stepping away."
If that were true, his mech technicians back in Cloudy Curtain would have been able to substitute for him when fabricating a gold label mech. Certain properties of Spirituality worked regardless of the distance, while other properties required close proximity to be effective. Ves wasn’t too alarmed by this fact. Step by step, he was figuring out the rules that governed this metaphysical concept.
What magic? Nothing remained mystical once you successfully derived the theory that explained the phenomenon!
Ves always retained a steadfast stance regarding things he didn’t understand. This was a perspective that the Bright Republic and many other secular states had propagated among their people. After all, too much superstition bred chaos, and aliens were known to pose as mystical beings in order to hoodwink humans.
As the mech technicians went to work, Ves figured he had a few hours before they finished their tasks. Until that happened, Ves had to finalize his vision in order to know for certain what he was working towards. It wasn’t his style to fumble around with mech parts and cobble them together without any expectation of what might result.
This was the approach of someone who was working with things he didn’t understand.
"There’s nothing about these low-end mech parts that I can’t explain. Nothing about them is hidden from my sight."
Ves sat down in front of one of the control panels of the workshop and started studying the schematics of the parts he dug up. The facility had already scanned the parts from inside-out, and though they were less comprehensive than the official design schematics, the data from the scans was sufficient for him to understand their essence.
"Good. Good. All of these are good parts."
Building a frankenstein mech was exceedingly complex and involved a lot of work. Ves did not commit himself to constructing such a difficult mech on a whim.
His ultimate purpose was to synthesize a mech of a higher grade from an eclectic selection of low-end parts.
In other words, he had to combine the different parts into a whole that was greater than the sum of its parts!
A normal mech designer could easily puzzle together parts that amounted to 1 + 1 = 2.
What separated good mech designers from the bad was that they could achieve a much greater synergy. Achieving 1 + 1 = 4 would be a cakewalk for most AIs.
However, the reason why humans remained dominant in the mech industry was their ingenuity could reach greater heights! Through a combination of skill, experience and vision, they might possibly achieve heaven-defying results such as 1 + 1 = 10 or even more!
Of course, this was a very simplistic way of looking at the mech design profession. A more realistic equation involved at least a couple of thousands variables. The complexity of designing a new mech without ripping off an existing one went far beyond most AIs.
Nothing was absolute, though. Ves heard rumors about the creation of super design AIs by some crazies from the New Rubarth Empire. There were always people that believed that everything could be automated by machines and lines of code.
As this endeavor directly threatened the livelihood of every mech designer, those crazies hid themselves well. If they ever leaked out their whereabouts, nothing would stop their annihilation!
"Well, that’s not for me to worry about." He shook his head.
He shifted his attention back to his design. He opened a design suite from the control panel and imported all of the parts in a wireframe form. This allowed him to easily modify or remove certain portions from their whole.
An hour went by as he unceasingly fit together the parts. This required a lot of modifications in order to make them fit. Ves had to pay attention to the method as well as the result. If it took too much effort to transform a part into something compatible to the new frame, then Ves had no choice but to discard it due to lack of time.
He needed to achieve the maximum amount of results from the least amount of work. Only then would he be able to complete the mech within the time limit.
Fortunately, his understanding of all of the parts was high. This enabled him to cut things out or change things up without significantly impacting their performance.
Piecing them onto a single mech was more complex though. Ves needed to complete this improvised design fast, so he inevitably skipped some corners.
"This frankenstein mech must be fit for a champion in the dueling ring."
At the same time he puzzled together his design, he also began to form its spiritual identity. He decided to form a single image this time. While he was very partial to his Triple Division Technique, it worked best when he designed a mech from the ground up. Applying it to a machine composed of parts of existing mechs might not be appropriate.
"A frankenstein mech will certainly possess a fractured identity. The mech won’t perform seamlessly in that case."
A vision took shape in his mind as his design came ever-closer to completion. Even though he hadn’t finished the final touches, he already completed the final vision in his mind.
"Not a Pointed Sentinel, but something that looks similar to it. A reborn Sentinel that is not a Sentinel. Fast, agile, lots of reach and most importantly sturdy enough to keep up with high-stress movements. This goes far beyond the range of a Sentinel."
His new creation broke the mold of a budget mech and stepped into a higher level. Though it wouldn’t be easy to achieve this height, Ves was already on the right track.
"The only downside is that I have to make some steep tradeoffs. Prioritizing speed and internal integrity above all else means that this reformed Sentinel will be rather lacking in terms of offensive and defensive power."
His current ability didn’t allow him to plug these gaps. Every choice came with a price. Ves simply didn’t have the time to work on the armor. As for the dip in offensive power, Ves wasn’t too worried about it because Avid Serpent’s Rogue Breaker didn’t excel in defense.
Now that he fixed a vision, he could start on shaping its X-Factor. Ves intended for the X-Factor to be the glue that fused the different parts into an entirely new whole.
In constructing the new imagine in his mind, Ves had two choices available. He could choose to build up a primal or a cognitive image. The former comprised of a totem animal that would massively strengthen the instincts of his mech. The latter took the shape of a human myth that provided more sophisticated aid.
"Considering that Captain Orfan already possesses strong instincts, a human myth is more useful to her. However, she doesn’t seem like the sort who thinks a lot during battle. If she won’t listen to her own brains, then she won’t be inclined to listen to someone else’s brains."
This left him with the choice of going for a totem animal. Images that fell under this category had the ability to fire up a mech pilot and granted them beastly instincts that could save their lives at crucial moments. Adding the strengths of the totem animal to Captain Orfan would mean that he doubled down on her excellent instincts.
Even Ves didn’t know how scary Captain Orfan would become when piloting a mech under such a spell.
"What a champion needs is a steed. A heavenly warhorse."
Ves imagined a godly horse that could sweep an entire plain within seconds. Everywhere it ran, the wake that followed behind it could pull an entire forest from the ground. Fast! The horse had to be fast!
As soon as he came up with the idea, the heavenly warhorse started to spring from his imagination. It came to life in his mind and began to look at the design that Ves worked on with impatience. The liveliness of its behavior astounded Ves.
"Good!"
The stronger his Spirituality, the more real his imaginary creations became. All of this was very abstruse right now, but Ves could definitely tell this heavenly warhorse already started off strong. Usually, his creations needed more accumulation before they reached this point.
With the heavenly warhorse taking shape, its influence started seeping into the design. As Ves finished the rough jobs and started zooming in to perform adjustments, the heavenly warhorse shifted in response. It was as if the design and the image already shared a connection from birth. Before the image took up residence in the design, it underwent ceaseless changes in order to increase its compatibility.
This was a very vital process. Usually, Ves took months to design an original mech, but he only had hours this time.
As the mech technicians completed their tasks one by one, Ves had to put an end to his design work. Though it looked horribly unoptimized in its eyes, its theoretical performance had already reached a higher level than the base model of the Pointed Sentinel! Optimized or not, even a rough utilization of its strength should be sufficient enough to compete against Avid Serpent!
Once he decided to finalize the design, the heavenly warhorse immediately left his mind and took up residence in the new design. Even though Ves hadn’t done justice to the design, the heavenly warhorse appeared very pleased!
"Alright, gather around, everybody! It’s time for you to take a look at my design."
Most mech technicians finished their assignments by now. They eagerly sat up and walked towards Ves, who showed off his new design. In order to align them to his thoughts and turn them into channels of his will, it was important for Ves to explain his new mech.
"This is the design I’ve come up with after selecting all of those parts. Its purpose is to fuse the strengths of all of those separate parts to construct a mid-range mech from low-end parts!"
Though the mech technicians already knew what Ves intended to do, to speak it out like that impacted them nonetheless. It was simply too ambitious for them to comprehend! Wouldn’t mid-range mechs require mid-range components?
"What’s the name of this design?" A mech technician asked as he admired the technical mastery that Ves had demonstrated in fusing those parts together.
"I call it the New Sentinel. It takes the basic template of the Pointed Sentinel but elevates it to the next degree. The finished product will still resemble the old version, but its actual performance is far from regular."
This was because Ves had picked some of the best parts from the junkyard. Though all of them came from low-end mech that the arena organization didn’t attach much value to, they happened to be best points of their original mech models.
"The New Sentinel is built from heavily modified versions of the parts I’ve collected. Each of these parts have their merits, and I’ve taken care to select the strongest parts that will still be able to merge with the frame of the Pointed Sentinel. Compatibility issues will undoubtedly pop up, but I’m confident I can deal with most of the problems."
Each mech model had their good and bad points. Unless a mech designer deliberately screwed around, every design that came from their hands should contain some elements with a competitive level of performance.
In his initial selection process, Ves straight up ignored the trashy bits and and took away the best parts. Combining all of them into a single frame meant that the New Sentinel shook off most of the weaknesses of the old design.
Of course, that was easier said than done. They all had a lot of work in store.
"Chief Haine."
"Here."
"I’ll hand over the responsibility of modifying the parts and assembling them together over to you and your men. Try and finish the work within two-and-a-half days."
"That’s going to be tough." The chief said as she seriously studied the schematics of the new design. "You’re asking us to perform a lot of radical changes."
"I’ve designed this new mech with very loose tolerances. You don’t need to be too precise in fashioning the new parts. Just get it done in time."
"I can’t promise you we’ll meet your target, but I’ll work my men like hell to get it done."
Chief Haine immediately issued a set of orders, dividing the work among the men. Every part needed major adjustments in order to make them compatible with the New Sentinel.
By far the largest job consisted of changing out the artificial musculature. Ves was very unsatisfied with the musculature of the old Pointed Sentinel. Ophidian-Wheelax Industries had plainly cheaped out by buying an inferior component license for the muscles of the mech. This was truly infuriating considering that melee mechs depended on a good artificial musculature system to exert their offensive power.
It was the equivalent of equipping a doddering old man with a spear and a set of armor! No matter the quality of the gear, if the underlying foundation was weak, the mech would never be able to surpass a certain level of performance!
This low maximum ceiling of performance directly countered OWI’s original intention of designing a mech with a high price-to-performance ratio. With such a low cap on performance, how could the Pointed Sentinel ever be a good bargain for mech pilots with decent skill?
Ves basically butchered the old man and pieced a new body together with the butchered parts of other corpses. The unholy creation that came into being would hopefully be able to match the strength of a warrior at his peak.
"Hahaha! What a great feeling! So this is how it feels like to create a true frankenstein mech!" Ves spontaneously laughed. He felt as if he had gone mad for a moment. "I never knew that breaking so many important rules was fun."
Of course, the rules were there for a reason. Mech design was a profession that was littered with rules that formed a comprehensive list of best practices. If Ves was an ordinary mech designer, he would never dream of building a frankenstein mech. The only reason why he dared to do so was that he not only possessed a broad foundation, he also made use of the Jury-Rigging Sub-Skill.
The value of this Sub-Skill was inestimate to Ves. It saw very little use when he designed an original mech, but when it came to modifying existing mechs, Jury-Rigging turned into a vital necessity. It would rarely be the case where he would have the ideal set of mech parts at hand. With this Sub-Skill at hand, he could draw on decades of experience in substituting proper parts with less optimal ones.
It was like replacing an amputated leg with a prosthetic. Although the replacement limb would never work as good as the original, it at least did the job of enabling the person to walk again.
While Chief Haine pressed her mech technicians modify the parts in rapid tempo, Ves directed his attention to the most challenging task of all. Unifying the different parts on a software level.
Rashly cutting mech parts from other wrecks and sticking them to another frame never worked unless they came from the same product line. In order to mate these parts together, Ves had to unify them on a hardware and software level.
Ves had already taken care of the former by completing the New Sentinel’s design. He could trust Chief Haine to make sure the mech technicians didn’t screw up on that front.
The only work he couldn’t outsource was working on the software. This was something that only Ves possessed the qualifications to tamper with. "It’s a good thing I’ve shored up my programming skills recently."
Though his Computer Science Skill only reached a Apprentice-level standard, this was already good enough for the vast majority of independent mech designers to program their own mechs. Ves also learned how to hack into the existing programming of the mech, though he never dug in too deep in that field because it clashed with his design philosophy.
"This is going to hurt."
Ves could take a couple approaches with regard to the software of his new mech. The most optimal approach entailed creating a new software from the ground up. This sucked up a huge amount of time, so he directly skipped to the next option.
The next approach would be to download a standard operating system from the galactic net and work his way into integrating all of the parts into the software system. This was also a time-consuming option, but Ves was confident enough to compress the work within three days if he skipped a lot of steps. The result wouldn’t be very pretty, but the mech should roughly be functional without any major compatibility problems.
"Then there’s the last option.
The quickest and dirtiest approach entailed retaining the original software of the Pointed Sentinel. This left intact the many peculiarities and optimizations from OWI. Naturally, Ves still needed to incorporate the parameters of the new parts and make sure they would mate with each other.
The last two approaches were in fact very similar. One started off from a fresh install, while the other continued on from an existing configuration.
"It’s going to take a lot of time to get the software into a fighting shape if I want to work from a fresh install. On the other hand, retaining the existing software will likely prompt a lot of compatibility problems when I install a lot of strange parts that the operating system has never been programmed to work with. Squashing all of those issues might take even more time."
In the end, Ves decided to wipe out the existing software and install a generic software system for spearman mechs from the galactic net. He chose this option because he could at least foresee how much time he needed to finish the work. With the other option, Ves couldn’t predict how many compatibility issues would crop up and how much effort it took into solving them all.
"I’ve already taken enough gambles as it is right now. I can’t keep risking my slim chances of success on sudden failures."
Ves went to work behind the console. Though programming a new software system for the New Sentinel entailed a lot of work, Ves faced a smoother journey than normal because he started off from a good base. The software he downloaded from the galactic net already incorporated all of the basic and vital functions of a spearman mech. Ves merely had to adapt it to the New Sentinel.
Three days quickly went by.
He made a lot of progress in that time. Though the software could never match up to the programming of a mature mech model, Ves believed his work didn’t look too shabby.
"According to the simulations, the mech is able to perform all of the basic maneuvers without delay. The frame should only hitch up during the most complex movements."
The importance of the operating system was that a mech designer or a professional programmer could preconfigure many standard mech movements.
To put it simply, it was like adding muscle memory to a mech. A mech pilot would be able to make use of the muscle memory as shortcuts. This lowered the mental burden on the mech pilot and enabled them to make the most efficient movements from a single thought.
Ves unfortunately didn’t have enough time to expand upon the programming. The mech he programmed right now possessed the muscle memory of an average civilian with maybe a week’s worth of spearmanship training.
With enough time, Ves could increase the strength of the software to match the performance of a trained spearman with more than a decade of dedicated training!
"This is the strength of a good mech programmer!"
Sadly, Ves didn’t appear to be fated to excel in this area. Certainly, if he put his mind in this field, he could become fairly proficient in this area. However, it was unlikely that Ves progressed beyond that level.
"Designing a mech is like creating a new life. Programming is essential to ensure the mech can be functional, but too much may not be a good thing."
Mech designers who excelled in programming could accomplish amazing feats. Ves had worked by Alloc’s side for a time and he had seen what a Journeyman-level mech designer who specialized in programming could do. In short, they could turn a worthless piece of rock into a shining piece of jade!
The work that Ves had done over the last few days was far from reaching that level, but at least it should do the job.
"Let’s see if Chief Haine has upheld her end of the work."
Ves had been wholly absorbed in programming for his new mech. One of his major faults was that when he put his whole mind onto a task, he pretty much tuned out everything else.
He stepped away from the console and entered the assembly area of the workshop. Ves immediately saw the shape of a complete mech. Fixed in place within the workshop’s assembly system, a gaggle of mech technicians climbed all around the frame of the mech to perform the finishing touches by hand.
"Well." He said with some surprise. "The mech is almost finished!"
"It took a few sleepless nights, but we almost got it done." Chief Haine said as she approached from the side. "We had to take in a lot of stimulants in order to work day and night. Hell, my men will probably sleep for two straight days after finishing up the mech."
Skipping sleep was easy. Countless substances enabled humans to push through their desire for sleep. The only problem were practically hard-wired into requiring sleep. Ves could imagine that all of the mech technicians paid a heavy price to work for three straight days.
"Did you push them into this brutal schedule?"
"Nope." The chief technician shook her head with a smile. "We all know that Captain Orfan’s life is at stake. What’s the worth of our good rest if we aren’t willing to put it all to increase the odds of her survival?"
"You’re right. We’re ultimately trying to make the best mech possible so that Captain Orfan will win her honor duel. None of us should complain about our workload."
Now that the physical construction of the New Sentinel was about to be finished, Ves could finally load in the new software and see for sure whether the mech worked as expected. They didn’t have much time left before the duel commenced!
A lot could change in three days. Transforming a collection of low-grade parts into a single mech required both effort and thought. Ves supplied the latter while the mech technicians supplied the former. Neither of them held back in their attempts to transform the limited Pointed Sentinel into a strong and valiant New Sentinel.
Working day and night, the sleep-deprived mech technicians sacrificed much to maximize their productivity. Under the constant babysitting of Chief Haine, the techs found the will to keep pushing onwards and complete a week’s worth of work in less than half the time.
At the latter half of the three-day period, the mech technicians started to slip up. Even if they could push themselves to stay awake with the help of stimulants, their concentration inevitably suffered. Plenty of work had to be redone due to small mistakes. This was also why the tech crew hadn’t managed to finalize the assembly of the New Sentinel up to now. They still needed to catch up to the last tasks that needed to be done.
Everyone was dead-tired right now except for Ves, whose physique easily sustained a few extra sleepless nights. All of them yearned to drop into comfortable beds. Hell, they didn’t even need a bed.
"Seeing is believing." Chief Haine said as she admired the frame of the New Sentinel that she had practically shaped by proxy. "I didn’t think your frankenstein mech would work, to be honest. There’s so much complexity involved in mating those different parts together that I didn’t believe a few hour’s worth of design planning can solve all of the compatibility issues."
Ves looked at his New Sentinel with pride. To outside eyes, the contours of the mech did not differ too much from the Pointed Sentinel. Though the arms and legs appeared to be different, Ves had deliberately selected stronger limbs that nonetheless match the proportions of the original ones. This prevented a lot of troublesome compatibility issues such as disrupting the balance due to grafting a muscled arm onto a thin female’s frame.
Outwardly, the New Sentinel hadn’t changed too much. Inwardly, the mech had practically gone through a rebirth. Ves replaced virtually every core component with stronger ones salvaged from various mechs. Besides the cockpit and the internal support structure, hardly anything was left from the Pointed Sentinel.
"With a new engine, power reactor, sensors, a set of energy cells and more, the upper ceiling on the New Sentinel’s performance is roughly twice as high as its predecessor." Ves predicted. "That should be more than enough to cope with Captain Orfan’s demands."
"I’m still a bit iffy about the transplanted artificial musculature. That’s an enormously risky operation, you know. It’s not every day we do something like that."
"Even if there are minor errors in the implementation, the New Sentinel can cope with it. The raw power that the mech will gain from this transplant is more than worth the risk."
Ves highly prioritized the act of unifying the artificial musculature. All of those limbs came from different mechs. The biggest compatibility issue that arose from merging them with the torso of the Pointed Sentinel was that the muscles simply wouldn’t match. Trying to fudge them around until they mated with each other took too much time.
So Ves decided to do something drastic. He ripped out all of the old muscles and transplanted a set of new one. This set came intact from a single complete mech wreck. Ves would have no worries about incompatibilities as a consequence, but trying to make them compatible with the New Sentinel was an extremely difficult challenge.
This momentous task consumed an enormous amount of time and effort from the mech technicians.
"I hope the mech won’t lock up its muscles when we first boot it up." Chief Haine prayed. "We’ll suffer a fatal blow if it turns out that all of our work is in vain."
"Your work won’t be in vain. I can promise you that." Ves replied confidently.
He had a good feeling about the New Sentinel. Despite its unfinished state, the mech radiated a subtle aura of spirituality. The X-Factor had taken root in its frame. It not only infused a copy of the heavenly horse, but also carried the earnest aspirations of the mech technicians that worked on the frame.
The latter influence was miniscule, so they didn’t pollute the spiritual quality of the mech. Ves even figured that it added some complexity to the X-Factor. The untamed ferocity of the heavenly horse was the dominant component of the X-Factor and should help unify the different parts into a single whole.
"All that is left is to load in the software." Ves spoke.
He stepped on a lifter platform that brought him over to the opened cockpit. After slipping inside, he loaded in the software and started making some final tweaks that he had been saving for last. This was necessary because the physical state of the New Sentinel didn’t completely match the theoretical design schematics.
"A few screw ups and misinterpretations can pile up and lead to significant change."
Therefore, Ves had to spend a precious hour configuring the software to match the actual condition of the mech.
"Finished!"
It took a little longer than he thought, everyone tentatively finished up their work on the mech. Every part was in place and the whole frame was put together nicely.
The entire crew looked at their mech with emotion. All of their sweat, blood and tears had been poured into this frame. Its complexity went far beyond a civilian mech.
Now was the time to put the mech to the test. Captain Orfan walked over in full piloting gear. During the last three days, she hadn’t been idling. Ves had loaded in the virtual design of the New Sentinel to the simulator pod so she could become accustomed to its properties.
"Are you ready to mount your steed?" Ves asked the captain.
"I’m ready to roll!"
Boundless confidence radiated from the mech captain. She had never flinched away from the upcoming duel to the death. To a mech pilot like her, representing the honor of the Flagrant Vandals was a pivotal achievement in her career. The possibility of death had never swayed her courage!
"Be careful, captain. The physical copy won’t move as smoothly as the virtual version. When you test it out, don’t go full throttle just yet. Start off with the basic movements and slowly work your way up there. I might need to make more adjustments along the way."
"Got it. I’m not stupid, you know."
After the captain boarded the mech, everyone stepped far away as the mech finally booted up. Its humanoid eyes lit up as its power reactor started supplying power to the entire mech.
Ves sat behind a control panel and vigilantly stared at the telemetry transmitted by the New Sentinel. Though he already spotted a couple of minor hiccups, they didn’t affect the performance of the mech too much. He already started performing some tweaks and uploaded the changes into the operating system of the New Sentinel.
The mech immediately became less discordant. So long as Ves didn’t plan on making any drastic changes to the programming, he could continue to adjust the performance of the machine as it stayed operational.
"You can start moving, captain! Please move the limbs one by one!"
The New Sentinel slowly lifted up an arm. Nothing hitched up. It then started to rotate the limb around before performing increasingly more complex maneuvers. It repeated the same routine with the other limbs.
Throughout the testing process, Ves ceaselessly smoothed out the wrinkles to insure the programming didn’t become a hindrance in the operation of the mech. As the New Sentinel moved over to a testing ground and started to put its frame to its paces, the mech continued to hold up.
"It’s a success!"
"I can’t believe we got a frankenstein mech to work!"
"How is it possible that this mech runs so well!?"
By the time Captain Orfan had to stop in order to rest up for the upcoming duel in the evening, everyone looked gratified that their efforts hadn’t been in vain. At the start, many of them held doubts. They thought that Ves foolhardedly picked the most complex approach to improving the Pointed Sentinel.
Now that they witnessed the increased performance of the New Sentinel first-hand, they knew that the sacrifice was worth it. The unrestrained power the New Sentinel exhibited significantly exceeded their expectations!
"Hah!" Orfan laughed as she hopped out of the cockpit. "I wasn’t sure I’d be able to pilot such a good mech in battle, but you sure delivered on your promise, Mr. Larkinson! That Avid Serpent won’t stand a chance with my new mech!"
The performance of the New Sentinel couldn’t match her service mech, but it came close enough to accommodate her fighting style. This was a mech with very good bones and muscles. Even if it was clumsy in some areas, it did not lack in reaction speed and agility!
Compared to a piece of trash like the Pointed Sentinel, the frankenstein mech was a machine fit for the arena!
"Go take a break and prepare yourself for the upcoming event." He told her. "I’ll hang back and perform some minor optimizations."
Ves didn’t require anyone’s help, so he dismissed the tired mech technicians as well. They deserved a well-earned rest.
Left alone in the workshop, Ves looked at the fruit of his labor and sighed to himself. This project only took three days, but the difficulty involved with getting it to work rivaled the challenges he faced when he designed the Blackbeak and the Crystal Lord.
"In some way, the New Sentinel is my third original mech design."
He missed the experience of designing a mech. Spending so much time with the Vandals taught him a lot, but one thing he regretted was that the Vandals didn’t allow him to showcase his design ability.
When this honor duel first came about, Ves immediately skipped the easier options because they amounted to nothing more than modifying an existing mech. Such changes didn’t go far enough in his eyes.
"This is what I live for. A mech designer can’t do without designing mechs."
This experience reminded him that he should never lose sight of his core purpose.
Ves met many mech designers along his way who fell off the correct path. Many mech designers who failed to jumpstart their careers shifted into other jobs such as repairing or appraising mechs.
Other mech designers who hadn’t been able to stand up on their own in the market joined larger influences and became part of large design teams. Though this still allowed them to contribute to new designs, they would never gain as much compared to the lead designers.
Only by making all of the major design choices by themselves would mech designers be able to refine their ability to design a mech!
"Every other path except for designing your own mech leads to a dead end."
This was what he believed in. Though talented designers could still climb up the ranks as part of a design team, they inevitably developed gaps that might be hard to make up in the future.
"I have to find a way to keep designing mechs." He concluded. "I’ll stagnate if I stop for a long period of time."
This was easier said than done. The mech designers of the Mech Corps worked in rigid design teams where Seniors decided everything. Ves was far from reaching that height.
"Hm, unless there’s a drastic change, I’ll likely remain in charge of administration before going back to being a number cruncher."
The positions he took up with the Vandals rounded out his experience, so he hadn’t wasted his time. The experiences he went through would serve him well for the rest of his career once he became involved with more collaborative projects.
Ves shook his head and dragged his mind out of the clouds. "I shouldn’t pat myself on the back too soon. I still need to touch up the New Sentinel before it’s ready to fight for real."
Many people caught up to Harkensen III in the past few days. All of the hype surrounding the honor duel between Captain Orfan and Avid Serpent attracted lots of mech fanatics.
The underground arena made a killing by selling tickets at inflated prices. The demand for a seat was so huge that the arena decided to add floating stands to the arena in order to stuff as much people in their venue as possible. They intended to make the best use of the open space above the arena!
Part of the reason why tickets became hot was that underground arenas prohibited any broadcasts and recordings. Even though the authorities didn’t care about shutting them down, the underground still needed to remain out of sight from the public. The underground arena utilized loads of jamming and interference technology to uphold this custom.
This basically meant that the honor duel was an event that someone might only experience once in their lives! Ves could imagine how many people wanted to catch up to the duel.
"When something hot becomes rare, its value spikes."
Ticket prices shot into space, crowding out the regular folk who could only spare a thousand marks at most. Last Ves had heard, the cheapest tickets sold for 20,000 marks!
Though it seemed that the entire Harkensen System went crazy, in actual fact only a small proportion of visitors and locals were caught up in the hype. Many tourists never heard about the Flagrant Vandals and didn’t particularly care about the honor the Vesia Kingdom.
Still, many Vesians and Brighters attached a lot of importance to the outcome of this duel. Citizens of the Republic and the Kingdom practically felt duty-bound to attend, though the extreme ticket prices scared many of them away.
The underground arena already made a killing by selling inflated ticket prices, but their appetite hungered for more. They opened up betting stations in many places in the Harkensen System.
In this, they failed to grab the lion’s share of the market. This was because the more established betting companies moved first. With their existing infrastructure, they held a definite advantage over the underground arena that had to keep most of its operations in the shadows.
No matter how Ves looked at it, the Reinaldans brazenly profited from the honor duel. "It’s like they can’t let off any attempts at earning money."
All of the betting elevated a sober duel between two mech pilots from different states into a match with billions of marks at stake. Ves was worried that some might seek to pressure one of the duelists to throw the match. He wasn’t naive to think such cheating never happened, particularly in the underground circles where enforcement was lax.
"Well, it probably won’t work this time."
The Flagrant Vandals backed Captain Orfan, so anyone wishing to coerce her into throwing the match would have to face the fury of an entire mech regiment.
As for Avid Serpent, she wouldn’t initiate an honor duel if she didn’t value her principles. To some people, honor was everything. To others, honor was something that they couldn’t touch or sell. How could they value something that didn’t really exist?
"Well, even if Avid Serpent is only for show, the worst she can do is tarnish the Vesia Kingdom’s honor. Any sabotage from her side won’t affect the honor of the Vandals."
While Ves didn’t concern himself too much about foul play, he still made some precautions of his own. Ever since the New Sentinel came into being, he never let it out of his sight. Anyone who wanted to tamper with the mech had to overcome his vigilance first.
Fortunately, as the time of the duel arrived, nothing went wrong. By the time Captain Orfan returned and entered the cockpit for the upcoming show, Ves felt reassured that nothing would go wrong from now on. He followed an arena attendant out of the workshop and sat down at a seat reserved for him at the very front.
He looked around and saw only strangers. It was too bad that Chief Haine and the mech technicians declined to attend. Sleep haunted them for days. They deserved their rest.
Right now, the final pre-show ritual came to an end. Due to the honor duel, the regular duelling schedule had been ditched. Nothing was allowed to upstage the honor duel.
"Ladies and gentlemen, Vesians and Brighters, Reinaldans and Roppongans, wherever you hail from, welcome to the main event!"
Anticipatory music pumped through the entire arena, affecting the moods of two-million attendees. Ves looked up as a massive floating stand of seats hovered over his head. Above those floating stands was another set of floating stands, and so on. If their antigrav modules ever suffered a malfunction, hundreds of thousands of people would crash into the people sitting below.
"Damn, is this even safe?"
It wasn’t as if the underground arena was required to adhere to any safety rules.
He forced himself out of his worries and turned his attention back to the stage.
"There is no greater rivalry in this corner the battle for supremacy between the Bright Republic and the Vesia Kingdom! Two different states with two very different ideals have clashed for several hundred years without a winner in sight! Has anyone heard of a conflict that lasted so long?! Only the rivalry between the Terrans and the Rubarthans comes close!"
Many audience members laughed and jeered at the Vesians and the Brighters. Their constant warring had become something of a joke in the Komodo Star Sector.
The Vesians were portrayed as mule-headed dunces for their repetitive wars of aggression that never seemed to win them anything at the end.
The Bright Republic on the other hand gained a reputation for being punching bags for the Vesians.
They were like a dysfunctional couple where an abusive husband kept hitting his wife.
Ves glowered a little as the Reinaldans amused themselves into thinking they were better. "Without the Frozen Leaf Alliance, would you still be able to make fun of the Vesians?"
After a few minutes of blathering, the announcer finally moved on to the duelists.
"Without further ado, let us welcome the mech pilots who will stake their lives over this duel! Two may enter, but only one will leave!"
Two separate gates opened up, allowing two separate mechs to enter the field.
Ves held his breath as he beheld the Rogue Breaker. While Ves had transformed the Pointed Sentinel into something new, he never believed his competitor would stay still.
"Look at Avid Serpent! What are those add-ons attached to the frame of her mech!?"
Some people recognized the strange external components that surrounded the joints and other parts of the mech.
"Those are force boosters!"
Force boosters basically enhanced the movements of the mech at critical moments. They weren’t seen very often because of their complexity and high energy demands. Still, in a short duel, these force boosters could easily amplify the power exerted by the Rogue Booster by a significant amount!
"And that’s only the external changes."
Ves couldn’t see anything different about the Rogue Breaker from within. Someone as good as Creta would never neglect the internal structure of the mech. Only when the fighting started would Ves be able to see what his rival had changed.
"Certainly, Captain Orfan won’t have it easy."
There was one aspect in which the New Sentinel surpassed the Rogue Breaker. Though Avid Serpent had attracted a lot of attention, her mech didn’t appear to be too special despite the external additions.
Though the New Sentinel looked a little duller, the mech somehow possessed a faint charm that compelled most of the audience members into admiring its form. Its cheap armor inherited from the old Pointed Sentinel did little to cover up its allure.
"Does this spearman mech look a little different from last time?"
"Why do I feel like I’m looking at a whole other mech from three days ago?"
"I thought the Pointed Sentinel was a trash model! How come I’m itching to buy one right now!"
Though Ves wasn’t able to access the System, he estimated the strength of the New Sentinel’s X-Factor to be in the low C-grade or high D-grade. Though this paled in comparison to the B-grade of the Crystal Lord, this was still sufficient enough to stoke people’s desires.
It was too bad that no one equated the special nature of the New Sentinel to Ves. As always when it came to mechs, the mech pilots attracted all of the attention while the contributions of the mech designer faded into the background. Ves smiled ruefully as the announcers never even credited Mr. Creta and him for elevating the mechs to new heights.
"Before we start this duel, do any of you two ladies have second thoughts? This is your final chance to withdraw! After the signal is given, the gates will remain locked and the energy screens will remain up until blood has been drawn! Cockpit ejections are blocked and leaving your mechs won’t do you any good! This will be a true fight to the death with no exceptions!"
The consequences of failure was serious. Even if one side wished to be merciful, the arena organizers wouldn’t brook any diversions from the script. As the guarantor of the honor duel, they had taken up the responsibility of enforcing the terms of the duel to the letter. Their reputation would be ruined if they failed to uphold the terms.
"I have never feared death! All of those who slandered me are wrong!" Avid Serpent yelled from her mech. As always, her identity remained a secret and the voice scrambler did a very good job in obscuring how she truly sounded. "As the challenger of this duel, I will not disgrace myself by going back on my vow! Come what may, I will bear the consequences of my actions!"
Her valiant statement won over a significant part of the public. Her story had an air of mystery and tragedy around her. Despite being labeled as a deserter, Avid Serpent had done a good job in presenting herself as a tragic figure who had left the Mech Legion for reasons other than cowardice.
Every person’s imagination harbored a different story of Avid Serpent’s fall. Some imagined her to be a noble lady whose entire House fell overnight. Hunted down by the forces of a rival House, the lady had no other choice but to flee the Kingdom and throw a cloak over her identity to escape pursuit.
Others figured her to be a talented commoner who had slowly risen up the ranks of the Mech Legion. One day, a noble ponce took a fancy upon her and wished to bed her. Avid Serpent violently resisted his advances and a major accident happened which claimed the playboy’s life. Enraged, his House sent assassins and bounty hunters after the woman, who had no choice but to find refuge in a neighboring state.
Many such stories circulated from people’s mouths and on the galactic net. Even Ves became intrigued by her origins. Who was she, really? Even Ves couldn’t tell.
"Hah! You Vesians are all the same!" Captain Orfan broadcasted from the New Sentinel. "You’re all bark and no bite! You better ready yourself for a beatdown, because by the time I’m done with you, you wish you were dead!"
Ves almost wanted to palm his face. The way she spoke made it seem as if the Flagrant Vandals was made up of nothing but boors. Even though that statement was somewhat accurate, Orfan could at least put their best foot forward.
Many thousands of Brighter visitors stood up and cheered for Captain Orfan and the Vandals.
"Go beat down that venomous snake!"
"I love you, Rosa! Please marry me!"
"Show these Reinaldans that us Brighters aren’t pansies!"
Once both sides had their say, the duel couldn’t be postponed anymore. "What courage! Neither duelists have flinched! Let us witness their ferocity and see whose convictions will stand at the end! BEGIN!"
An explosion erupted in the air above the dueling ground which served as the signal for the start of the duel. Both mechs instantly exploded into action. One wielded a spear, the other held an axe. The opening moves of the mechs revealed their true strength for the very first time!
The Harkensen System in the Reinald Republic welcomed many visitors every year. From tourists looking for excitement to outfits dropping by to conduct business, the lively star system was one of the most popular destinations in the region.
Many outsiders who weren’t fans of mechs or the shady transactions, they regarded the Harkensen System with contempt. "That den of thieves and greedy merchants is a hollow place. There’s no honest work to be found there! If the sun went supernova one day, nothing of value in the Komodo Star Sector is lost!"
Obviously, the Harkensen System seemed like a place where only thugs and thrill seekers gathered. There was hardly a sense of class to be found, and what luxuries Harkensen I offered appealed more to the nouveau riche than the true power brokers.
This was the Harkensen System on the surface. To the vast majority of the Komodo Star Sector, this was all there was to it. Such a shallow destination required little consideration.
However, all of this was a facade.
To be more precise, the Harkensen System operated on several different levels. What everyone saw could only be considered as the shallow layers. What was observable from the surface meant nothing to the secrets hidden below.
To those who operated on the highest level, the Harkensen System was not as pleasant and tourist-friendly as everyone had thought.
"Did you hear? The honor duel between a captain from the Flagrant Vandals against some Vesian deserter has just started!"
"If I hadn’t blown my entire budget at the casino earlier, I would have been able to afford a ticket!"
"Those blood-sucking Reinaldans! Who is crazy enough to pay 20,000 credits for a single seat?!"
Right now, a significant part of the Harkensen System became enthralled with the duel that happened in the arena underneath Black Belle City.
In other words, the duel diverted a lot of people’s attention, leaving others free to move in the dark.
On the other side of Harkensen III, a group of fit men and women walked through the streets of a medium-sized city. Their path led them from a commercial district to a decayed industrial district. This area of the city used to be a prime location for smaller mech manufacturers, but all of them folded one by one in the last couple of decades.
Many old factories looked shuttered and emaciated. The decay and blight attracted many lowlives who hung out in these streets due the lack of monitoring. The sensor network in this area hadn’t been updated and had long been tampered with long ago. Each gang that took up residence in the factories installed interference devices that blocked most small devices from making recordings or patch into local communication network.
This basically turned this blighted district into a lawless place.
Some thugs noticed the newcomers and approached them while holding their hands over their guns. They were about to bark the group of strangers away, but halted when one of them held up a token.
"We’re expected."
The lead thug huffed at that. "Hmph. The boss is at the end of the street."
Not a single gang member looked for trouble with the outsiders as they walked by. Nobody made any rash movements. Any group in possession of a token was allowed to enter their territory. That was the rule.
Ten minutes later, the group reached a fallen factory that looked no different from the others. Nonetheless, the newcomers shoved aside the rusted gate and entered the main structure.
The darkness inside made it difficult to navigate the factory floor. However, none of them activated any lights. Instead, they each took measured steps in the dark, relying on nothing but memorized instructions to get through the invisible maze. Not once did they bump into anything.
Once they reached the entrance to another hall, they went through a door on the left, which finally led them into a bare metal room with not a single piece of furniture inside.
The only sight that greeted them was a dozen men in heavy combat armor standing guard from the opposite side of the room. Two men in business attire greeted the newcomers.
"Welcome, welcome. I am glad to see you’ve made it here in time, Major Verle."
Impressively, the man in the center of the group in plainclothes turned out to be the commanding officer of the Verle Task Force! This man who led over ten-thousand Vandals had declined to attend the duel with the honor of his mech regiment at stake!
"The situation has changed." Major Verle grimaced at the person on the opposite side. "Too much attention is being cast on the Flagrant Vandals. Though the attention-grabbing duel has disrupted many of our plans, it has given us a good opportunity to sneak to this meeting."
"Were you followed?"
"Do you doubt our professionalism?"
The room fell into a brief silence.
"Let’s move on." The man on the other side said. "Our next step required us to bundle all of our strengths. After all, the Starlight Megalodon rests for no one. If we don’t hurry up, others will reach the derelict first."
Everyone present in the room pumped up once they heard that name. The Starlight Megalodon was not a casual phrase to be uttered whenever someone felt like it! Even now, the name remained a legend in the frontier.
"The Starlight Megalodon..." Major Verle uttered. "I really can’t believe we’re on the trail to that legendary battleship. A partially-intact derelict of the Common Fleet Alliance. Even if she’s a few hundred years old, the treasures we can recover is enough to overturn the entire star sector!"
"It all depends on whether we can get our hands on the keys." The other man said and turned to the person standing next to Major Verle. "Isn’t that right, Lord Javier?"
The Vesian noble had surprisingly accompanied Major Verle without any restraints or restrictions. "Relax, I know where to find the Things you are looking for. I know for sure that one of them is on this planet."
"Good, good. As long as we can gather all the keys, we can reconstruct the final route of the Starlight Megalodon!"
There was a reason why everyone looked fervent at the thought of tracking down the Starlight Megalodon. That was because she was a battleship packed with wondrous materials and technologies into the size of a small city! Over a dozen kilometers long and armed with massive planet-cracking weapons, the CFA predominantly utilized this ship class to wage decisive battles against tough alien civilizations.
Not long after the Komodo Star Sector came into being, the Starlight Megalodon was the flagship of a small CFA task force meant to press the sandmen back. Unfortunately, the task force encountered a freak accident during FTL travel, knocking most of the ships out of FTL. By the time the CFA ships converged with each other, they found to their surprise that the battleship that served as the nucleus of their force was gone!
Back then, the CFA tried hard to track down the Starlight Megalodon, but their search was in vain. They eventually concluded that the massive and expensive battleship was lost with all hands.
Nobody outside of the CFA really cared, and anyone that did took their word for it. Everyone soon threw the mystery of the Megalodon out of their minds until certain forces discovered the presence of descendents of the crew in the frontier!
Only a very small circle of people knew about the descendants, and immediately grasped them without alerting anyone else, including the CFA!
The secret movers learned many things from interrogating the descendants. However, tracing back their route to the Starlight Megalodon wasn’t as straightforward.
This was an operation years in the making. By now, the group collectively gathered almost all of the keys. After acquiring the ones exposed by Lord Javier, they could finally make an attempt at looting the valuable battleship!
How could they not be excited?! As an organization that shouldered the defense of humanity’s outer borders, their technology exceeded the lofty standard of the Terrans and the Rubarthans.
Almost nobody in the Harkensen System knew what was at stake. The Starlight Megalodon wasn’t even a footnote in history to most people.
Right now, Ves hung on to his seat at the front row of the underground arena. Captain Orfan’s New Sentinel charged at Avid Serpent’s modified Rogue Breaker without any qualms!
"Come on, captain! I put on my money on you, so you better win!"
"Die Vesian!"
Once the two mechs came close, the New Sentinel thrust out its spear with considerable momentum.
Clang!
A loud ringing noise reverberated in the arena as Avid Serpent deflected the initial stab with a flick of her mech’s axe.
The two mechs separated. Neither pilot was in a hurry to press their advantages.
Inside her cockpit, Captain Orfan felt as if her entire mech urged her forward. Though she really wished to up the ante and unleash a flurry of blows at the Rogue Breaker, she couldn’t afford to make any mistakes.
This wasn’t like a regular deployment. In a real battle, she still possessed the leeway to retreat from battle and live another day. Right now, both of their mechs lost the ability to eject their cockpits. There was no way out after commencing the duel!
Either she lived, or she died! With her entire life at stake, Orfan couldn’t treat this duel as a casual romp.
"Damnit, Mr. Larkinson wasn’t kidding when he said my opponent’s mech will be powerful."
What little the Rogue Breaker revealed already placed it on par with premium mechs. When it came to movement and attacks, the axeman mech certainly emphasized offense over defense!
"I’ll have to take it slow and steady." The captain concluded and shifted her mech into a defensive posture.
True to her prediction, Avid Serpent took the initiative and lashed out. It ran close and chopped with its axe. The moment the New Sentinel lifted up its spear to block the attack, but one of the force boosters attached to the weapon arm of the axeman mech suddenly glowed! The limb gained a lot more power as usual and accelerated forth at a blazing pace!
Clang!
However, Captain Orfan was an experienced mech pilot. She had never let down her guard after spotting the weird boosters attached to the mech. She managed to parry the axe chop in time!
"Don’t think these little toys can give you the edge! Taste my spear!"
Captain Orfan realized the force boosters allowed Avid Serpent to unleash a devastating attack. The New Sentinel still suffered from the aftershock of the weapons collision.
Perhaps the New Sentinel wouldn’t be able to last for the entire duel after blocking a handful of full-powered attacks!
This compelled the captain to go on the offensive. With the long reach of her spear, Captain Orfan quickly regained the initiative. She unleashed a flurry of stabs, leaving no openings for Avid Serpent to exploit.
For a minute, everyone thought that Avid Serpent would never be able to escape from those shackles. However, the axeman mech fought calmly while making sure that the spear never touched its armor.
"They’re both keeping up with each other’s movements!"
"Look at how different the two mechs move!"
Ves saw that Captain Orfan piloted the New Sentinel in an extremely aggressive manner, which was completely different from the game plan they set up!
"She’s wasting too much energy!"
This duel wouldn’t be decided within a short amount of time. Rationing the energy reserves of a mech was a basic priority for every mech pilot.
Worst of all, Avid Serpent maintained a sober mind throughout the assault. It always chose to jump out of reach, but when that wasn’t possible the Rogue Breaker fended off the spear stabs with the minimum amount of exertion.
"The Vesians are playing the long game."
As long as the New Sentinel exhausted itself, Avid Serpent only needed to make a single push to achieve a win!
Ves thought that Captain Orfan lost her mind after melding with her mech. Ves had infused the New Sentinel with the unbridled fury of the heavenly horse.
"Did I go too far?"
Ves constructed the image of the heavenly horse with an eye towards offense. However, too much offense was not a good thing.
Avid Serpent displayed a lot more self-control right now. The axeman mech she piloted cleverly showed off its nimbleness by dancing and dodging out of the way of unrelenting spear flurry aimed in its direction. Its axe rarely deflected the spear stabs.
"Stay still you rat!" Orfan yelled as the New Sentinel’s feet thundered forward.
"I’ve no reason to do that, you mangy dog!"
The Rogue Breaker refrained from showing off its cards. Its force boosters remained dormant, as Avid Serpent hadn’t found it necessary to draw upon their strength while on the defensive.
At some point, Captain Orfan ceased her constant aggression. Even she began to feel some strain after keeping the offensive going. The quirks and imperfections of the New Sentinel prevented her from piloting the mech as an extension of her limbs. Compared to her service mech, this frankenstein mech moved like a creaky robot.
The two mechs circled around each other before they went on the attack again. This time, the two mechs refrained from making any elaborate movements.
"They’re probing each other." A stranger said next to Ves. "They both acknowledged each other as worthy opponents. Since they can’t take down their opponents quickly, they’re taking a step back by trying to learn the other’s strengths and weaknesses."
The cautious probing and slow-paced movements caused the audience to become annoyed. Many of the audience members booed at Avid Serpent and Captain Orfan for being timid cowards. Where did Captain Orfan’s passion go? Why didn’t Avid Serpent display her full strength?
Only the more astute mech pilots understood that the battle had only just begun. Both of them were in it for the long haul.
"Has anyone found out the face behind Avid Serpent’s mask? I always thought her identity has issues."
"Hell, better men have tried. It’s like she’s a ghost in the Harkensen System. Before she showed up here, she hadn’t made a splash at all. Not a single Vesian knows who she is! For all I know, Avid Serpent might not even come from the Vesia Kingdom."
"Why would anyone lie about her backing?"
"I don’t know. Maybe she wanted to put herself in the spotlight and took advantage of the war between the two states."
Ves listened to the rumors around him but did not even come close to figuring out the true identity of Avid Serpent.
Not that it mattered too much in this case.
Seeing Avid Serpent move her mech even nimbler than the New Sentinel, Ves felt a little jealous at Mr. Creta’s accomplishments. The first time Ves saw the Rogue Breaker in battle, the mech exhibited a good amount of agility.
Under the care of an apprentice of Master Klaisewist, the Rogue Breaker experienced a transformation of its own that wasn’t any worse to what Ves had done to the New Sentinel.
Ves glanced around the nearby seats and spotted Mr. Creta calmly observing the fighting happening beyond the energy screen.
The Vesian mech designer abruptly turned towards Ves, and their gazes collided with each other. After a few seconds of staring at each other, Creta politely smiled at Ves and tipped his finger at him as if in salute before turning his attention back to the duel.
"What a tough adversary." Ves muttered. The man came from an earlier generation and possessed a definite advantage in age and experience. "It’s like facing someone who’s almost a Journeyman."
From the smooth performance of the Rogue Breaker, Ves could already tell that the mech experienced a large-scale strengthening. The mech was much more robust than before and its defensive strength had received a minor improvement as well. Overall, every performance characteristic had been strengthened without exception. None of its aspects became weaker.
This balanced strengthening contrasted sharply with what Ves had done to the New Sentinel. He had butchered the old mech and cobbled together an entirely new frankenstein mech. This boosted several of its performance characteristics to a whole new level, but the sloppy and hasty work had also impacted its integrity and other performance characteristics.
This led to two contrasting sights. One mech fought smoothly while the other fought with power.
"Enough of this dance. Take my Dervish of the Axe God!"
The axeman mech suddenly ceased to probe the spearman mech and started to commit to the battle. Some of its force boosters activated which abruptly put the mech into a spin! With its axe stretched out, the mech became a force of nature which could hack anything apart which strayed into its vicinity!
Despite spinning around like a figure skater, Avid Serpent’s mech somehow approached the New Sentinel with an alarming amount of speed. The Rogue Breaker’s Dervish of the Axe God was unavoidable!
Inside her cockpit, Captain Orfan began to sweat at the sight. "You don’t do things by half-measures, do you?"
The New Sentinel couldn’t escape this calamity. It was too near to its opponent! By the time it turned around and ran, the spinning axe would have already hacked against its frame!
It could only meet the forceful spin head-on!
Captain Orfan did not dare to put all of her trust into the New Sentinel’s spear. Against the momentum driving the axe into a spin, if the New Sentinel dared to parry it with the shaft, it was liable to snap!
This was also why she skipped the option of carrying a shield. Axemen mechs were known as shield breakers, and the Rogue Breaker had definitely been designed to tear them apart.
Ordinarily, Orfan knew she had to rely on her mech mobility to negate the attacks of an axeman mech. However powerful they were, they still needed to connect to be effective!
If not for Mr. Crete’s force boosters and other enhancements, Captain Orfan could have dodged throughout the entire match.
After waiting for the spinning axeman mech to come close, Orfan didn’t lose mind. Though the sight looked dreadful to the audience, the mech captain ignoring the spinning axe blade and jabbed the New Sentinel’s spear downwards.
"My mech’s reach is greater than yours, and no matter how fancy you spin your mech, it can’t do anything with the footing to keep it up!"
The tip of the spear failed to strike the nimble legs that kept the Rogue Breaker into a spin. However, the threat successfully diverted the unstoppable momentum of the dervish. After the New Sentinel struck again, it managed to trip one of the moving limbs which destabilized the axeman mech.
Yet Avid Serpent hadn’t spun her mech in vain. Just before Captain Orfan tripped up her mech, she commanded the Rogue Breaker to let go of its axe!
The hefty weapon spun into the air before striking the New Sentinel square into its chest!
BANG!
Many shards of armor plating erupted from the chest of the spearman mech. The flying axe had carved through almost every layer of armor plating! If Captain Orfan hadn’t adjusted her mech at the last moment, the axe might have cut off the arm of her mech!
Right now, she couldn’t afford her mech to lose an entire limb! Therefore, she took a gamble that the New Sentinel could take the axe hit without damaging the internals.
Her gamble paid off!
The free hand of the New Sentinel went up to grip the axe embedded into the chest, but Avid Serpent activated a mental command on her mech that recalled the axe back to its hand!
"Look! The axe is connected to the weapon arm of Avid Serpent’s mech! It can reel the weapon back in after it has thrown it out!"
This wasn’t an unusual sight with higher-end axeman mechs, but Ves was pretty certain the original Rogue Breaker didn’t incorporate such a feature. For Mr. Creta to add this feature to a mech in three days was very impressive because such systems easily broke!
"Avid Serpent isn’t retracting the axe completely! What is she doing?"
The Rogue Breaker kept the axe hanging onto its arm. Instead, it started to swing its weapon arm with the weapon still attached to the alloy cable.
The subsequent attack arrived at the New Sentinel a lot faster than Orfan anticipated. Her mech hastily put up its guard, allowing it to deflect the cable-bound axe with great difficulty.
Orfan tried to unleash a counterattack, but Avid Serpent merely sent out the axe yet again!
Right now, the spearman mech’s reach advantage had been reversed. The New Sentinel could no longer bully the Rogue Breaker by taking advantage of its reach. The proficient way in which Avid Serpent threw and retrieved its axe had baffled over half the crowd.
"What can a skinny cable do? I’ll hack it apart!" Captain Orfan yelled.
The New Sentinel dashed forward and dodged the spinning axe sent into its direction. Immediately after, it swung its arm in an attempt to cut the cable with its spear.
Ding!
Unfortunately, the collision showed that the cable remained steadfast throughout any attempts at breaking it apart. The fearfulness of Avid Serpent’s mech increased. What was more depressing to Captain Orfan was that she couldn’t get any close!
"Hahaha!" She laughed after her mech fended off the latest flying axe. "I’m usually the one who bullies others with my reach. If you think an old dog like me can’t think of another trick, then don’t blame me for losing your life!"
When Avid Serpent threw out another axe, the New Sentinel jabbed its spear yet again. This time, it didn’t bother with trying to cut the resilient alloy cable. Instead, it pushed the shaft of its spear against the strength and forced it to coil around it. It looked as if someone winded up a piece of loose cable!
"Caught you!"
With a mighty heave, the New Sentinel dragged the Rogue Breaker closer and unleashed a kick at the axeman mech that battered the mech’s internals a bit. However, somehow the cable gained a life of its own. The axe quickly shook off the entanglement with the spear and returned to the waiting palm of the Rogue Breaker as the kick it received had pushed it back.
"You’re not the only one here who can pull off a special move."
She declined to call out the name of the move, but that didn’t detract from the New Sentinel’s imposing manner. The spearman mech gripped its spear with both hands and stepped forth like the weight of the galaxy rested on its shoulder. Once it came into fighting range, the mech started spinning its spear!
Different from the Rogue Breaker’s Dervish of the Axe God, Captain Orfan didn’t intend to spin around her entire mech. Instead, the footing of the New Sentinel seemed like it was connected to a mountain! Knocking it off balance wouldn’t be easy!
"Come! Taste bewilderment!"
As the New Sentinel marched closer, it abruptly turned its spin into a slash that scratched one of the arms of the Rogue Breaker. Avid Serpent hadn’t anticipated the attack!
Just after completing the slash, the New Sentinel resumed with spinning the spear. Seconds later, it repeated the slash, this time succeeding in digging through the cockpit of the Rogue Breaker. This affected some of its sensors, causing Avid Serpent no small amount of difficulties.
"What’s this wheel of spears?!"
"That’s a party trick. It’s nothing complicated. Spearman mech pilots like to practice it because it improves our fine control over our mechs."
"If you want to copy Captain Orfan’s moves at home, I suggest you don’t do it in a populated area. Once you make a mistake, the spear will go flying and is liable to hit an innocent bystander!"
Right now, Captain Orfan had caught her opponent off-guard by using this parlor trick to obscure her attacks!
As the match entered a heated phase, the strengths of the Rogue Breaker became more evident. Ves constantly had to adjust his estimation of Gabriel Creta’s competence.
Although the apprentice of Master Klaisewist had not yet advanced to Journeyman, his technical competence alone revealed that he was extremely close to the threshold. This was by far the toughest match that Ves had ever faced!
Ves realized he made a mistake in underestimating his counterpart. "I can’t dismiss Apprentice Mech Designer out of hand."
He used to believe his System-upgraded Skills gave him an edge over other Apprentices. Now, he realized he didn’t factor in everything when comparing himself to other mech designers of the same level.
"There’s a difference between knowing how to do something and applying them correctly."
Though Mr. Creta’s work exhibited some specialties that Ves couldn’t replicate, most of the fundamental modifications on the Rogue Breaker wasn’t beyond his understanding. Basically, what Creta did, Ves could do as well.
"Yet even I wonder if I can accomplish the same in three days."
The two mech designers adopted different strategies to strengthening their mechs. Ves discarded the old and created something new. Mr. Creta on the other hand retained the quintessence of the Rogue Breaker but upgraded almost every aspect to a higher level.
The difficulty of the latter was lower, but it would be hard to achieve a major boost without a lot of work and clever planning. Mr. Creta somehow managed to compress a week’s work of modification work in three days, which was the same as Ves had done.
This basically meant his adversary’s design ability wasn’t any inferior to his!
"Mr. Crete doesn’t know as much as I do, but his management ability and his application of what limited knowledge he accumulated is better than mine."
Ves felt as if the fog that obscured the path to Journeyman receded a bit. Accumulating an enormous amount of theoretical knowledge did not necessarily make him a better mech designer. That only turned him into a huge bookworm with a lot more tools at hand.
A true mech designer only needed a couple of tools to create an amazing result. That represented true ability. "A mech is a product of science and art."
People could easily quantify the former. Science existed to define reality. Its language was expressed in math and rules.
As for art, this was something much more abstruse. It came from the wellspring of creativity and achieved results that was more than the sum of its parts.
With the design and construction of the New Sentinel, Ves had conceitedly patted himself on the back for turning low-grade goods into a higher grade mech. Yet his opponent not only matched his stride, but even exceeded it through different means!
Throughout the duel between Captain Orfan and Avid Serpent, the latter always managed to regain the initiative.
The parlor trick that Captain Orfan used to confuse Avid Serpent’s judgement was quickly seen through by the latter. Spinning around the spear like a ferris wheel subconsciously attracted her attention and messed up her rhythm. Once Avid Serpent learned to disregard the spin but focus instead on the footing of Captain Orfan’s mech, she managed parry her opponent’s attacks again and again.
This was because if the New Sentinel wished to launch an attack, it inevitably had to step forward!
"Looks like the jig is up." Captain Orfan said and stopped spinning her spear. Though it didn’t consume as much energy as the Dervish of the Axe God, it wasn’t very efficient either. "Then let’s see if you can handle the storm!"
Captain Orfan did not give up on her offensive. Giving Avid Serpent an opportunity to attack even a single time might prove fatal to her. The enhanced Rogue Breaker had almost broken right through the New Sentinel’s chest armor with a single blow! This was the thickest part of the spearman mech’s armor!
If Avid Serpent managed to land another hit, the New Sentinel would certainly suffer crippling damage. This wasn’t something Captain Orfan wanted to see, so she maintained her offensive despite expending large amounts of energy.
The New Sentinel moved forward and pushed the Rogue Breaker backwards with repeated spear stabs. This time, the spear didn’t surge forward in a repetitive motion, but contained a random rhythm that made it hard for Avid Serpent to judge when the attack would land.
Clang!
The Rogue Breaker barely deflected another stab, but the spear had surged forward like an unstoppable tide that had only slightly been bent. The speartip managed to scrape the Rogue Breaker’s arm and sheer through several layers of armor.
The hit created a weak point in the Rogue Breaker’s arm! If the New Sentinel managed to land another hit at the same spot, the axeman mech was liable to lose a limb!
Both mechs weren’t built like knights. Besides their chest and some strategic points on their frame, their overall armor coverage was lackluster. Both mechs relied on speed and technique to mitigate damage. While this prevented the two mechs from inflicting reliable damage to each other, once they managed to score a hit, the damage would always be severe.
Having gained an advantage, Captain Orfan smelled blood. She yelled out a guttural warcry and intensified her offensive. The Rogue Breaker continually receded as it tried to dodge or deflect the surge of spears.
"You can’t hold out forever, Avid Serpent!"
It was not that the Rogue Breaker wouldn’t be able to solve this attack, but Avid Serpent hoped to keep her cards close to her chest. Throughout the match so far, she predominantly played the long game. Now, it seemed she needed to expose one of her cards.
Avid Serpent carefully watched the incoming spear stabs and prepared her timing. When the spear shot forth yet again, the Rogue Breaker not only succeeded in deflecting it, the axeman mech also hooked the spear shaft with its weapon and drew it away.
For a moment, the New Sentinel left an opening.
This allowed the Rogue Breaker stepped into knife-fighting range and grab the New Sentinel’s shoulder! Just as it attempted to exert some force, the New Sentinel immediately retaliated by letting one limb off the spear before grabbing the opposite in a similar grip.
Both mechs started to push against each other!
With both the spear and axe stuck in a temporary deadlock, both mechs started to push and shove each other with their humanoid mech limbs. The amount of force an arm could exert in this manner was limited. Too much pressure risked damaging the limbs, but neither side could tend to this matter.
That was until the Rogue Breaker suddenly kicked out with a force booster-enhanced leg!
Captain Orfan widened her eyes as she only had a split second of time to fend off this sudden attack. Even though the Rogue Breaker momentarily weakened its footing with this attack, its leg whipped forward with destructive force!
Almost every countermeasure she could think of took too long to defend against the kick!
Then her eyes became savage. "If I can’t defend, then I might as well attack!"
The New Sentinel quickly jumped forward and off the ground while simultaneously letting go of its spear! Though the Rogue Breaker kicked landed against one of its leg, dealing serious damage, the fact that the New Sentinel had jumped meant the damage was less serious than expected.
This was because the New Sentinel basically pounced on the Rogue Breaker!
Due to its awkward kicking stance, the axeman mech couldn’t withstand the force, and started falling backwards!
Bang!
The mech landed with its back against the sandy soil. Though the New Sentinel had let go of its spear, that left both of its arms free to take advantage of the situation. The New Sentinel knelt on the waist the Rogue Breaker and started wrestling and punching against the helpless axeman mech.
When the Rogue Breaker attempted to slam its axe into the New Sentinel, the latter mech quickly held on to the arm of the axeman mech and restrained it from completing its attack!
With an enormous amount of weight pressed against the frame of the Rogue Breaker, Avid Serpent thoroughly fell into the leeway at the moment. The New Sentinel attacked and attacked with its other arm and only stopped when the Rogue Breaker grabbed it with its other arm.
The two mechs resembled wrestlers of sorts as both mechs tried to push each other around with their arms taking hold of each other.
All of these moves put a lot of stress on their internals! They were dealing just as much damage to their own mechs as each other!
However, Avid Serpent was thoroughly on the losing end right now. The waist of the Rogue Breaker began to become deformed as Captain Orfan’s mech kept pressing it from above.
She finally couldn’t take it any longer!
"GET OFF!"
Over half of the Rogue Breaker’s force boosters activated at full strength. An enormous surge of power suffused the axeman mech, allowing it to overpower the spearman mech and push it off its frame!
Sand sprayed all over as the axeman mech quickly climbed up to its feet!
As for the spearman mech, Captain Orfan hadn’t fought against the powerful surge of strength, but instead borrowed its force to roll her mech in the direction of its fallen spear. It quickly picked up its fallen weapon before rising up to its feet in a ready stance.
The Rogue Breaker hadn’t gone for the attack. Instead, the mech retrieved another axe from a hidden compartment in its rear. The hand axe looked smaller than the original one, but its lethality was without question.
Ves remembered that Avid Serpent’s mech used to hide a laser pistol in the same compartment. Now it seemed that Mr. Crete had fashioned a small axe that fit the same area.
With a second weapon in hand, Avid Serpent’s mech had shifted into duel wielding a pair of axes. Before Captain Orfan could process the change, the Rogue Breaker dashed forward. Its axes rose high before plummeting over the head of the spearman mech.
The New Sentinel barely held up its spear shaft to block the heavy attacks, but with force boosters strengthening the duel attacks, the defending mech almost buckled!
"Again!" Avid Serpent screamed and her mech unleashed another attack!
This time, she went all-out, saving none of her energy reserves. The Rogue Breaker turned into a chaotic storm as both of its axe-wielding limbs attacked in an independent fashion. Each axe chop came at a different angle and timing, causing Captain Orfan a lot of grief.
The New Sentinel’s spear shaft started chipping from the force of the axe blows. Even though Captain Orfan tried to dodge as best as she could, her mech simply couldn’t move fast enough to evade the blocks. Only by blocking would her mech be able to hang on. If not for those force boosters, the Rogue Breaker would never be able to chip away at Captain Orfan’s spear shaft!
Clang! Clang! Clang!
The New Sentinel continually stepped back as it found itself unable to breathe through the current crisis. The duel-wielding axeman mech practically attempted to suffocate its opponent through unleashing constant attacks.
Like a weight pressed against her body, Captain Orfan felt as if she couldn’t endure for long. She cursed at herself for giving her opponent the opportunity to unleash her own attacks. The fearsome momentum of an axeman mech on the offensive was no joke, especially when it wielded two axes at the same time!
This time, their roles were reversed! With the New Sentinel on the defensive, it could hardly find the opportunity to strike back at its opponent. Meanwhile, the Rogue Breaker’s offensive seemed unstoppable, but in actual fact it drained a lot of energy!
What this did signify? It basically told Ves that Avid Serpent figured out everything she needed to know!
The face of Ves turned ugly when the Rogue Breaker pressed the New Sentinel with its flurry of attacks. The duel-wielding axeman mech exhibited a distinct superiority over its adversary, and never stepped out of range, giving the New Sentinel very little room to maneuver!
Clang! Clang! Clang!
Each swing of the axe landed with the force of a hammer. The Rogue Breaker seemed to dance on the arena ground, causing the public to become mesmerised by its ferocious movements. Even Ves found the view to be compelling in a way. There was a pattern to Avid Serpent’s chaos, but it was too abstruse for Ves to figure out.
The reason why Captain Orfan found it difficult to defend against the assault was because of the random nature of Avid Serpent’s attack routine. Sometimes, the force boosters lent more power to the blow, while other times they remained inactive. The irregular activation of the force boosters left the New Sentinel unbalanced as its pilot was unable to adjust its defense.
Captain Orfan gritted her teeth as she endured the assault. She had been afraid of this outcome! Giving the Rogue Breaker a single breather had been enough to turn the tide!
"My mech isn’t any weaker than hers!"
The Vandal mech officer was pleased with the New Sentinel’s performance up to now. The machine may have been somewhat weird, but it was mostly able to keep up with her movements.
However, it still missed a pace compared to her service mech! That difference was subtle in some aspects, but huge in other aspects. These limitations constantly frustrated the captain and prevented her from performing her desired moves.
The duel between the two mechs had entered a superheated moment. The entire audience stopped speaking as they concentrated on the current phase. Nobody wanted to miss the moment where something changed. This might be the last seconds before the New Sentinel succumbed!
Ves bit his lip. He knew the New Sentinel the best. Captain Orfan had done her utmost and squeezed out every bit of performance it could unleash.
The spearman mech accumulated more battle damage as time went on. The New Sentinel currently bore two major wounds. The first one was the chest wound where Avid Serpent’s axe had dug into its chest armor. The second one was the leg which suffered major damage from the Rogue Breaker’s kick.
The other mech wasn’t in a good condition either. One of its arms suffered a cut, while a couple of other attacks spread the mech with wounds. However, the most significantly damaged portion of the Rogue Breaker was its waist area.
When the New Sentinel knocked down the Rogue Breaker and climbed on top of the prone mech, Captain Orfan’s mech had pressed down with its entire weight. The Rogue Breaker hadn’t been able to bear this weight, thus its waist became deformed!
Somehow, this hadn’t impacted the performance of its engine, but the same couldn’t be said for its leg joints. The Rogue Breaker had to move its legs forcefully in order to keep up its offensive.
"The honor of the Flagrant Vandals is at stake! I can’t falter like this!"
She had proudly stood up and answered Avid Serpent’s challenge three days ago. This was because she felt boundless confidence in her own ability to overcome Avid Serpent. The Vesian hadn’t shown off any exceptional ability back then.
It turned out that Avid Serpent fooled them all!
Even though the Vesian piloted a much-improved mech, that wasn’t of much use if her skills couldn’t keep up. The problem was that Avid Serpent’s performance exceeded everyone’s expectations.
This meant that Avid Serpent had definitely held back at least twenty to thirty percent of her strength when she dueled Broken Claw!
This additional boost in skill was the difference between an average advanced pilot and a peak advanced pilot. It separated the rank-and-file from the officer-level mech pilots in the military.
Captain Orfan bet with at least eighty percent certainty that Avid Serpent used to be a mech captain as well! Her opponent’s courage and judgement stood out from regular mech pilots like a crane among chickens. It reminded her of the time she clashed against the recently-advanced Venerable Foster!
The suffocating pressure emanated by Avid Serpent threatened to engulf Captain Orfan. "Really sneaky of you, Avid Serpent! You’ve hidden yourself well!"
"It’s not my fault you imbecile Vandals fell for my ruse." Avid Serpent taunted back as her mech kept unleashing more and more attacks without any signs of depleting its energy reserves. "How else would I be able to goad you dumb brutes into stepping onto the arena field?"
"Do you even care about your own honor? Hiding your identity like a rat and relying on subterfuge to get ahead of us, do you feel proud of yourself?"
"My pride is nothing you should concern yourself about! I hope the Vandals have prepared your coffin, because your broken corpse is about to rest in it! Sleep well and know that your defeat will be the stepping stone to my redemption!"
The New Sentinel’s spear became more ragged as it had to block more axe attacks. Although the material held up against the strikes for now, it wouldn’t be able to hold out for much longer, especially when her opponent didn’t have any scruples about conserving the energy of her mech.
"I can only choose to suffer!"
Captain Orfan let go of her desire to defend. Instead, she stridently controlled the New Sentinel to flip its spear in an offensive stance. The mech ignored the incoming axe attacks and instead thrust out with its spear in a desperate jab!
The twin axe strikes landed upon the unguarded New Sentinel without any hindrance. One axe bit deep into the side of the New Sentinel, while the other one heavily damaged one of the spearman mech’s shoulders.
Its performance had definitely suffered a significant impact this time as its internals received significant damage! However, because the axes had dug into her mech, the Rogue Breaker had momentarily exposed itself to Captain Orfan’s counterattack.
The spear stab almost went straight through the abdomen of the Rogue Breaker. However, the abundant layers of armor ultimately prevented the spear from penetrating into the internals.
The New Sentinel’s attack lacked sufficient force! Its sudden attack came out of nowhere, and while this had caught Avid Serpent off-guard, the New Sentinel hadn’t been able to put much weight behind the thrust.
Still, even if the spear stab hadn’t managed to pierce the abdomen, the kinetic energy behind the blow wasn’t easy to shrug off either! The shock incurred by the internal components underneath the abdomen was sufficient to hitch up the Rogue Breaker for a single instant.
This was enough for the heavily-damaged New Sentinel to disengage. Bearing new scars on its shoulder and its sides, it practically lost most of its functionality of the arm attached to the damaged shoulder. For all intents and purposes, the New Sentinel could only choose to fight on with a single arm.
"Kill the Vandal! She’s a sitting duck now! Finish her off!"
"The Bright Republic always comes back from behind! Go Captain Orfan! You can still do it!"
"Damn, who told me that betting on a mech captain is a sure win?! My marks, my precious marks!"
The crowd erupted in an explosion of emotion at the end of this sequence of attacks. The Rogue Breaker proved to be more valiant than the New Sentinel! Its unending flurry of axe attacks had finally achieved the desired result and crippled the New Sentinel into a one-armed mech!
Though Ves momentarily felt despair, his mood still contained some hope as Captain Orfan had successfully disengaged without giving her opponent the opportunity to finish off her mech. As long as the New Sentinel still kept standing, she still retained the opportunity to win. All Ves could do was hope she had what it took to turn the situation around.
The next minute went by without any suspense. The New Sentinel continually had to give up ground as the Rogue Breaker advanced again and again. Its twin axes became huge threats to the New Sentinel because it couldn’t block the attack with only a single working arm.
Both its offensive and defensive ability had been halved!
Despite her overwhelming advantage, Avid Serpent sought to finish off her opponent as quickly as possible. She held nothing back and activated her force boosters again and again with much greater frequency.
The longer the match went on, the greater the chance of an accident!
Perhaps her opponent wasn’t clear about the Rogue Breaker’s situation, but her axeman mech expended over two-thirds of its energy reserves. The imposing level of performance granted by the force boosters demanded a heavy price that would soon come to roost if Avid Serpent wasn’t able to trustle up her opponent.
"This will be easy." She smirked as she saw how flurried the spearman mech had become. "What can you do with a single arm?"
Again and again the axes landed glancing blows against the faltering New Sentinel. Captain Orfan tried to evade the attacks at all costs, but the damage incurred by her mech worked against her. Her mech was wounded and bleeding and her opponent did not have a single merciful bone in her body!
Under this enormous amount of pressure, Captain Orfan tried to stall her opponent in any way she could think of. The main reason she fell behind was because her mech’s upper body suffered a substantial amount of damage.
Losing the functionality of an entire arm ended all of her hopes of winning through superior spearplay!
The captain wracked her brain for a way to turn the situation around. She refused to accept her defeat, not when more than two million people watched her disgraceful performance!
"Think! What can I still do?!"
She suddenly thought back of the Rogue Breaker’s abrupt kick. If the New Sentinel’s upper body was no good, what about the lower body?
Though one of the legs suffered some damage, it wasn’t to the point of crippling it entirely. Captain Orfan’s face adopted a resolved expression. With her back against the wall, she decided to lash out one more time with the most desperate move she could think of!
The New Sentinel dropped to the ground at her command! The two axes that whizzed in its direction only met empty air as Avid Serpent did not anticipate such a move! Still, her reaction speed was great, as the Rogue Breaker immediately sought to step onto the fallen mech and crush it with the weight of its entire frame.
"Not today, you snake!"
While the Rogue Breaker directed one of its feet forward, the legs of the New Sentinel snapped forward in a scissor that clamped down onto the stretched leg of its opponent.
"Caught you!"
The upgraded musculature of the New Sentinel showed off their power. It pulled the Rogue Breaker into a fall, straight into the spear held ready and waiting!
However, the Rogue Breaker chopped down with its twin axes as it fell, both of them aimed straight at the torso of the mech on the ground!
A huge collision occurred that boomed throughout the entire arena! The Rogue Breaker had fallen on top of the New Sentinel with both of their mechs unleashing their final attacks!
Some audience members screamed. Others winced. Most of them leaned closer in order to see which mech had survived the final clash.
As the dust cleared away, the audience gasped as they beheld the damage. The New Sentinel’s spear had ran straight through the middle of the Rogue Breaker! Meanwhile, the axeman mech had embedded both of its axes deep through the wounded torso of the other mech.
Both mechs landed their strikes around the area where the cockpit was situated at!
"Is it... a draw?!"
"That can’t be! Maybe someone missed!"
A mutual kill would be a devastating outcome to the duel. Though it excited some of the rumor mongers, most people who put money behind one of the mech pilots hoped dearly that one of them made it through.
After a few seconds of suspense, one of the mech exhibited movement. Then the other mech moved as well.
"Both of them survived!"
Yet... what happened now? Both mechs didn’t seem to be in a shape to continue the fight. The Rogue Breaker was practically impaled, while the spearman mech was squashed underneath the other mech.
The duel had reached its end stage. Everyone in the audience held their breath after the dramatic turn of events. They all thought that Avid Serpent possessed the advantage. Not only did she cripple her opponent’s mech, but the offensive she put out fully denied her opponent the opportunity to make a comeback.
Yet Captain Orfan found a way to fight back after all. She did so by performing one of the greatest taboos in mech combat, which was to drop her own mech to the ground!
There was almost no reason for a mech to lay prone on the ground. Not only would the machine lose most of its mobility, but it also put stresses on its frame which the designer had never anticipated. Furthermore, a mech that had collapsed on the ground was a sitting duck for any enemy mech. They could easily wreck a prone mech by stepping on it once!
Yet before the New Sentinel completely fell down, it had somehow succeeded in tripping the Rogue Breaker. Not only that, but the mech had also positioned its spear with its butt against the ground in a prime position to impale the falling axeman mech.
"What an amazing desperation move!"
"How did the Vandal mech manage to pull that leg down?"
"Finish off the Vesian!"
When the two mechs exhibited movement, the crowd started rooting for their favored mech pilot. With the Rogue Breaker impaled by a spear that miraculously held on up to now and the New Sentinel being squashed by the former mech with axes embedded into its chest, which mech still possessed the energy to finish the match?
In one of the front seats, Ves gripped his fists and hoped the damage to the New Sentinel wasn’t as bad as it appeared. In times like these, he felt the pain suffered by many mech designers.
It was no secret that many humans in the galaxy wanted to become mech pilots. People like Ves only became mech designers after finding out that their aptitude would never allow them to interface with a mech. Though he had ultimately turned around and embraced his current career, a small part of him still craved to fight in a mech rather than supplying it to someone else.
This was a feeling shared by many mech designers. Back at Rittersberg, his professors sometimes touched upon this subject.
"As mech designers, we are destined to be the people cheering our warriors on. Our primary role in society is to support the mech pilots. Do not delude yourself to be one of them. Even if your causes are the same, their fight is not our fight. The winds and rains that they have to go through in order to survive another battle is theirs to endure. If one mech pilot dies, there is always another customer for you to engage."
Ves recalled those words as he silently rooted for Captain Orfan. Some mech designers believed they needed to be dispassionate to their clients. Others believed that mech designers should build a close connection to the mech pilots that used their products. The different schools of thought often fought against each other, and up to today neither side had achieved superiority.
He supposed he ordinarily fell into the school of thought that believed a mech designer should keep their distance with their clients and avoid becoming entangled with their affairs. If someone bought a Blackbeak one day and used it to massacre an isolated village, Ves did not feel guilty at all. What did the actions of a lunatic have to do with him?
His cognition changed when he accompanied Walter’s Whalers in their jaunt to the Glowing Planet. Ves found it hard not to care about their lives when he serviced their mechs. Still, even when most of the Whalers died in the hellish campaign, Ves hardly shed a tear for their loss. They were only acquaintances at most to him. He couldn’t even recall the names of the fallen.
It was only when he rode with the Flagrant Vandals and assumed responsibility as a head designer that Ves had finally gone over to the other side. Ves cared a lot about the Vandals, and his heart bled whenever they suffered casualties in battle. This was especially because his fingerprints were all over their mechs. Though he hadn’t serviced them personally, the men who worked on the machines largely followed his instructions from above.
Right now, Ves felt the same burden of responsibility crushing on his shoulders.
The strength of a mech depended on both the mech and the mech pilot. Though the skill of the mech pilot was beyond his purview, the state of the mech could not be separated from his hand. The Pointed Sentinel was an old creation of Ophidian-Wheelax Industries, but the New Sentinel was thoroughly a creation that transcended its origins.
"This mech duel isn’t a one versus one. It’s a two versus two."
Captain Orfan versus Avid Serpent.
Ves Larkinson versus Gabriel Creta.
Ves felt fully invested in this duel. Though he could never match the dedication of the mech pilots who put their lives at stake, Ves felt as if his own competence was at stake.
"The New Sentinel is a mech that stems from my work!"
Right now, with both mechs piled up against each other, the capabilities of the mech pilots ceased to be important. What truly counted at this moment was which mech designer fashioned a better machine!
Which mech would still be able to fight after suffering such heavy blows? Would the New Sentinel be able to push off the Rogue Breaker? Did the latter mech still have the capability to function after an entire spear was thrust through its chest?
The answers to both questions relied on how well the mech designers built the mechs!
"Come on! You can still fight!"
Though the New Sentinel suffered a lot more blows than the Rogue Breaker, the damage should have been rather shallow. Ves carefully looked at the axes embedded into the chest of the spearman mech and judged that the weapons hadn’t penetrated too deeply.
Too bad the angle of view was rather bad for him. He turned to the sides and looked at the projections with a magnified view of the mechs. "There’s a fifty percent chance that the power reactor or the cockpit has suffered a breach."
If the former had happened, then the New Sentinel was finished. Luckily, it didn’t appear his frankenstein mech had reached that point. The axes stopped short of dealing direct damage to the power reactor!
"Since the mech is still moving, then the damage to the cockpit isn’t fatal to Captain Orfan!"
Good! This meant that even if the New Sentinel suffered severe damage, it still possessed enough energy to fight!
Though Ves had not paid too much attention to improving his mech’s internals, he nonetheless carried over many improvements in this area. He figured if the armor of the New Sentinel wasn’t that good, he should at least strengthen the internals so that any breaches would not drag the entire mech down.
Considering that Ves faced a melee mech, he focused primarily on enhancing the New Sentinel’s redundancy. This basically meant that if the mech suffered a crippling blow, it would still be able to retain some of its functions through other means.
This was also why he felt confident that Captain Orfan could still win the match. "With all the redundancies I’ve introduced, the power reactor should still be able to function at a diminished capacity.
The only variable that concerned Ves was whether Avid Serpent possessed the same opportunity! Though the Rogue Breaker looked as if it had seen better days, Ves feared that the spear had not inflicted enough damage. It depended a lot on what components the spear had actually damaged. Did the weapon pierce something important, or did it strike something of less value such as heatsinks?
A strange minute passed as both mechs fumbled against each other. Neither mech was able to exert a lot of power. Both had suffered serious damage that affected their motor capacities. The New Sentinel wasn’t able to push off the frame of the opponent’s mech, while the Rogue Breaker couldn’t even lift up its axes.
"Punch!"
The two mechs eventually resorted to wrestling with each other. In this, both sides possessed distinctive advantages. The Rogue Breaker still possessed two working arms, while the New Sentinel only had to make do with one. The upside was that the latter mech’s arm retained a lot more strength!
"Keep punching, captain!"
With no weapon in hand, the New Sentinel had no choice but to bare its fists against its adversary. The mech kept punching against the axeman mech’s torso. The continuous punches aggravated the condition of the mech as the energy transferred by the punches messed up its internals. Though the damage done by each punch was slight, the longer it went on, the greater the chance of a critical fault!
The Rogue Breaker attempted to counterattack, but its limbs had turned especially feeble! Ves looked closely and determined that while its power reactor still functioned properly, its transfer of motive power had been cut by at least eighty to ninety percent!
This meant that the axeman mech could barely summon the power to lift its own arms!
The entire crowd displayed a mix of responses to this turn of events. Many found it disappointing that such a heated match ended in such an exceptionally low note. Others still held out hope that Avid Serpent could stage a comeback.
Alas, the spear impaled through the Rogue Breaker’s frame happened to cut through a critical junction to its engine! While Crete had been prudent enough to implement redundancies, the spare junction happened to be situated in the same line!
One junction at the front and another one at the rear. Ordinary battle damage would never penetrate from one end of the mech to the other end of the mech.
In truth, Gabriel Crete focused upon elevating the performance of the Rogue Breaker. He spent insufficient attention on increasing its redundancies!
Both mech designers had chosen different paths, and Ves appeared to have chosen wisely!
After a few minutes of punching and fiddling, the New Sentinel finally managed to pry open a gap in the torso armor of the other mech. Once it opened up this vulnerability, the spearman mech gleefully reached out with its fingers towards the axeman mech’s cockpit!
It was too bad that both mechs seemed to have lost their speaker functionality. Otherwise, they might have been able to hear Avid Serpent’s last words.
"Kill her!"
"Vesia will never forget this!"
"Stop! You don’t have to kill her!"
The New Sentinel’s finger finally breached the cover of the cockpit. With as much power as Captain Orfan could direct, the New Sentinel firmly pressed within the cockpit like finger pressing down an insect hiding within a hole!
When the finger drew back, a smattering of blood marked its surface.
The announcer suddenly came to life again. "Our sensors show no life signs within Avid Serpent’s mech. The outcome is clear! The winner of this honor duel is Captain Rosa Orfan of the 6th Flagrant Vandals!"
The entire crowd went wild with glee or despair. A lot of people had bet their money on Avid Serpent, but even more bet on Captain Orfan! After all, one mech pilot was in the dark while the other was a strong captain from a military mech regiment!
Still, a lot of people rooted for Avid Serpent, including almost every Vesian in the crowd. Their faces appeared sullen as Avid Serpent’s loss not only implicated her honor. It would have been acceptable if she suffered from her own consequences. The problem was that she dragged down the dignity of the Vesia Kingdom upon her fall!
After displaying so much strength near the end of the match, how could she lose so ignobly at the very end? Every Vesian felt angry and ashamed. As much as they wanted to roar against the unfairness of it all, the fact of the matter was that they lost!
That night, over two million witnesses to the duel went crazy. The story of how Captain Orfan’s mech tripped the other mech before punching it to death became an instant legend in the Harksensen System!
The honor duel had been the most exciting arena battle on Harkensen III in recent memory! So many people hit themselves on their heads for declining to attend. If they only coughed up 20,000 marks, they would have seen the dramatic course of the events in person instead of listening about it in hearsay!
Those that attended the duel erupted in jubilation or despair. There was no doubt about it. Despite the unconventional ending of the duel, the match had definitely been worth attending!
Though the Vesians visiting the system all became depressed, most people thought that Avid Serpent fought very ably. She displayed a lot of skill and fought with ceaseless courage. If the engine of her mech hadn’t been impacted so much, then she no doubt would have kept hitting back.
"Avid Serpent hasn’t lost. Her mech failed on her. How could it break so easily after being impaled by a single spear?"
The Vesians sought out a scapegoat to vent their frustrations. There was no better target at the moment than Gabriel Creta. What Master’s apprentice? What successful businessman? Your work fell short!
A lot of shade was being thrown at him, a lot of it without cause. Ves sympathized with his competitor. That could have been him. At the end of the match, Ves got to opportunity to meet Creta again. Both of them gathered in the underground halls leading to the workshops.
"Mr. Creta. I’m sorry for your loss."
The older man shook his head. He didn’t appear to take the criticisms directed against him to heart. "She went into the ring expecting to win or die. Her death is not unjust. You’ve done an amazing work at transforming the Pointed Sentinel mech."
"It’s a shame about Avid Serpent." Ves remarked. "I never got to learn her identity. Do you know who she is?"
"She never confided her identity to me. I think she hoped to take off her mask and announce her name to the public when she won the honor duel. Now that she has lost.. It’s better to let sleeping dogs lie."
This could be considered a final mercy to the woman that bore the name of Avid Serpent. Though losing the duel hadn’t affected her honor all that much, there was no doubt she dragged the name of the Vesia Kingdom through the mud. If the Vesians found out her real name, they would doubtlessly curse her name for a couple of months.
The two mech designers talked shop for a few minutes. Both of them briefly described what they had done. As expected, Creta hadn’t gone as far as Ves! When the other mech designer heard that Ves went as far as turning the Pointed Sentinel into a frankenstein mech, he expressed his admiration.
"That was exceptionally risky of you, but it evidently paid off. Even I never expected that your mech could keep up with the Rogue Breaker after it had passed through my hand. All the time, I was modifying the machine with an eye towards a comprehensive crush in performance against your mech. It seems I was very much mistaken at that."
After chatting some more, they finally said goodbye to each other. Ves enjoyed the talk. He faintly perceived that Mr. Creta was from the same mold as him. Compared to their allegiance, they cared more about designing mechs. Both of them harvested a tiny bit from their conversations.
"I really can’t underestimate older Apprentices. Not all of them are stagnating at a lower boundary than me." He sighed as he watched the other mech designer walking towards the exit.
Ves hadn’t been able to learn too many lessons from Creta’s shallow exposition. However, he was still able to affirm that the other mech designer was able to utilize his knowledge more exquisitely than what Ves could accomplish by himself.
"This is what experience brings."
Someone who had been in the game for decades developed their own polished methods. In a situation where a mech designer wasn’t able to increase the breadth and depth of their knowledge, they instead attempted to develop ways to utilize their existing knowledge better.
"He’s making the best of what he has!"
Ves had mostly faced younger mech designers in design duels in his career. Rarely had he been able to compare notes with someone who could be considered a veteran in the business like Gabriel Creta. The direct comparison of their work this time illuminated Ves that he had a long way to go with regards to designing better mechs.
"The only problem is that progress of this kind only comes from time and effort. I can’t accelerate this learning process through any other means."
Even if he acquired a million Skills and a hundred Attribute poitns from the System, he would still muck it up somehow. More tools at his disposal did not mean he could design a better mech. It was how he used it that really mattered.
Ves contemplated about this issue the entire way back to the temporary Vandal compound. As he crashed into his bed, he still hadn’t figured out a way to improve his utilization besides designing lots of mechs.
"Maybe that’s why designing multiple original mechs is one of the criteria to become a Journeyman Mech Designer. Without practical experience, how can a mech designer be any good at utilizing what they learned? A useless bookworm who can’t design a mech on their own is unqualified to become a Journeyman."
It also explained why some mech designers stalled in the Apprentice phase despite designing scores of mechs. One of the factors that held them back was doubtless their poor grasp on utilization. If they robotically churned out design after design without putting all of their effort and passion into their work, they would likely consider it to be a chore.
No matter how much anyone had harvested from this duel, Ves had definitely won a lot. The path to advancement became a lot more clearer in his mind. That alone was worth all of the effort of designing a frankenstein mech.
The next day, everything appeared to go back to normal. Half of the Vandals enjoyed shore leave while the other half were hard at work at fixing up their assets.
The only thing that changed was that everyone felt like a winner. Captain Orfan’s performance had put the Flagrant Vandals in a very good light! Despite being billed as a raiding regiment, Orfan showed the Reinaldans and the visitors that they still possessed teeth!
"Hahahaha! I can’t forget what happened last night! Avid Serpent had us on the ropes, but we whallopped her good!"
"Hey! Have some respect for the girl!"
"Why should I? She’s a Vesian, and a treacherous one at that! As far as I’m concerned, she got what was coming for her!"
The Vandals spoke non-stop about the duel. This wasn’t a surprise as many of them attended the duel. Of course, they could never pay the entire 20,000 marks for a seat. Instead, the Vandals received a whole bunch of free tickets from the underground arena. Just like Ves, they received free tickets because they were all related the Vandals.
After breakfast, Ves joined his old group with lots of welcome and appreciation. Though Captain Orfan earned the most kudos out of the Vandals, the contribution of Ves had not been forgotten. It was thanks to his efforts that her mech held out despite suffering a lot of damage!
"I heard from a mech technician who worked on the captain’s mech that you turned it into a frankenstein mech! Is that true?" Ensign Tiss asked.
As an engineer, Tiss was clearer than most people on how difficult it was to cobble up a frankenstein mech together.
"It takes a lot of smarts to prevent it from falling apart."
"What a boastful mech designer!" A mech pilot exclaimed.
"Alright, knock it off, Vandals." Lieutenant Nolsen Feray said. "I’m sorry you missed the last couple of days, Ves, but there are plenty of sights left to see. We only have a short time left on Harkensen III before we head over to the beaches of Harkensen I. Let’s make the best of our time."
Their group had already drafted an entire schedule for their stay on Harkensen III. They already visited several iconic sights on Harkensen III such as famous mech museums and historical monuments. They even visited the black markets in the evening.
As the group boarded a large-sized aircar that took off into the air, Ves asked what they experienced the last few days when he was absent.
"How are the black markets?"
"Very shady." Tiss said as she blinked at him with her big eyes. "It’s a lot less friendlier than the grey market. They forced us to wear a sensor-blocking veil and mask that Nolsen scanned on his own to determine whether they had been bugged."
"Did he find something?"
"Surprisingly, no. The black markets are fairly scrupulous in this. They wouldn’t be able to attract any customers if they’re nosing the true identities of their visitors."
This told him that the black market wasn’t without rules.
"Why do you look so grim then?"
"The black market isn’t really a place for outsiders like us to mix in. It’s a lot ruder than he grey market. Everyone is acting quiet and mysterious. Still, the things they have on sale can make you dazzle."
Ves could imagine the kind of products that circulated in the black market. Most of the goods had likely come from the hands of pirates. Still, that didn’t detract from his interest.
According to the schedule, Ves still had an opportunity to visit a different black market. At that time, he would naturally be able to sample what the pirates and scummy treasure hunters routinely harvested.
The next couple of days, Ves made up for lost time by visiting many different sights on Harkensen III. The lively cities on the planet didn’t pale too much in comparison to Black Belle City. The only thing that disappointed him was that he missed out on visiting the capital city’s black market. The other markets underneath the medium-sized cities all catered to a special clientele.
The one Ves had visited was a market for slaves. All kinds of humanoid and non-humanoid aliens could be obtained from this market. The sight disgusted some of the visiting Vandals. Even Ves found the practice to be repulsive.
Not only did they have to endure lifeless aliens stuffed into cramped climate-controlled boxes, the market also seemed especially desolate at this time.
"What’s wrong with this place? Has something happened?" He asked.
"The Reinaldans are kind of spooked." Nolsen explained. "You might not have heard about it, but a little of trouble has stirred up lately. Last night, two unsealed mechs started fighting at some place called Kwanza City. In another city, an unknown group invaded a restaurant and slaughtered all of the customers!"
"That’s brutal!"
"I heard it was some kind of gang hit because many of the guests were part of some local gang." Tiss said. "I’m not too sure about the details, but the Honored Ones are blaming the violence on the local gangs."
"What do the gangs have to say?"
"They’re blaming the foreigners for all their troubles."
In other words, everyone was pointing fingers at each other instead of trying to cooperate to stem the tide of violence. Ves furrowed his brows. Why did such incidents crop up during the time the Vandals stopped over at this star system? Were the Vandals related to these incidents? Too bad he couldn’t read any clues from the news reports.
"I’m already looking forward to shuttling over to Harkensen I." Ves said lightly, trying to disguise his interest in the incidents. "If this planet keeps blowing up all the time, I would rather spend my time on the beach."
The Flagrant Vandals slowly emerged out of the rut they fell into after reaching the Reinald Republic. Like a wounded bear emerging out of a fight, they emerged stronger and more resilient.
Captain Orfan’s performance in the underground arena became a point of pride with the servicemen. Her demonstration of her individual fighting prowess propped up the other Vandal mech pilots. This not only lifted everyone’s pride, but also increased their bond of brotherhood with their fellow Vandals.
Though these effects fell short of turning the Flagrant Vandals from a regular mech regiment into an elite mech regiment, the shift in mentality nonetheless formed a point of evolution in their martial tradition.
Many armchair generals spoke about martial tradition. It not only rose through steady accumulation, but also through major battles and sudden turning points. Each event deepend the history of the mech regiment, causing it to become more distinct.
Ves had mostly been out of sorts lately. It was a good thing that Harkensen I offered the perfect opportunity for him to relax and contemplate his recent insights.
Different from Harkensen III, the first planet from the sun aimed to create an entertainment paradise that had nothing to do with mechs. Practically no one received a permit to operate a mech on the surface of the planet. The only mechs around bore the colors of the Honored Ones, and these machines only patrolled the most strategic centers.
In every other place, the Honored Ones adopted a more discrete countenance. They toned down their physical presence on the streets and made do with much less heavy gear. Overall security was still good, but it became much less overt on the planet.
Pleasure, entertainment and fun became the focal points of Harkensen I. From its famous stretches of beaches, to the endless casinos and nightclubs, the planet touted itself as a famed holiday destination in the Komodo Star Sector.
The planet attracted two kinds of tourists. The regular kind made up the bulk of the visitors. The other kind consisted of mech pilots that needed to wind down. Though the latter category didn’t spend as much as the whales, their presence on the planet attracted many people fascinated with mech pilots. As long as someone wasn’t too rude, they would be able to interact with mech pilots on a daily basis!
The lack of overt militarization on the planet made it a prime therapy planet to mech pilots that experienced traumatic events.
With its proximity to Harkensen III, it was no surprise that many outfits tended to stop by in the Harkensen System. Just like the Flagrant Vandals, they found it convenient to service their ships and mechs while allowing their crew to decompress at the same time.
"The Reinaldans really take their no-mechs policy seriously here in Harkensen I." Ves noted curiously as his group strolled through a boulevard looking over a stretch of golden beaches. Thousands of vacationers dotted the area, each of them trying to forget about the worries of their daily lives. "On Harkensen III, it’s impossible not to bump into a mech, but here you have to go to a military base to spot the mechs."
"Don’t think the streets are unprotected." Nolsen cautioned them all. "I’ve spotted countless Planetary Guard patrollers in plainclothes. There are hidden turrets and defense fixtures all around. Though they can’t withstand a determined attack, fending off a few random mechs is easy enough."
The security officer’s words revealed that Harkensen I was nearly as well-defended as the mech-crazy Harkensen III. The vacation planet simply camouflaged its fangs.
"That’s a lot more security than normal I think." Another Vandal said.
Ensign Tiss nodded at that. "It’s no surprise that the Reinaldans are strengthening their security presence. All of the gang warfare and outbursts of random violence has thrown Harkensen III into turmoil."
Everyone’s faces glowered for a moment. The so-called gang warfare that wracked the underbelly of Harkensen III disrupted an decades-old pact of keeping the fighting on the down-low. Even if a gang needed to hit their rivals, they should at least do it out of sight. Too much violence was bad for business.
"This is Harkensen I. There’s no industry here and no mechs that can rampage around." Ves reassured everyone. "The gangs at sway on this planet leech off the tourists. There’s no way they are willing to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs."
That lifted everyone up again. So far, none of the fighting had spilled over to Harkensen I and Harkensen II. Both of them were very different planets, and the Reinaldans had a better hold over security on those two planets.
"Look! There’s a race going on!"
The group walked towards a crowd of beach goers surrounding a group of young men and women preparing for a boat race. Technicians surrounded the boats and continuously tuned them up.
Ves ignored the boastful talks and exaggerated claims of the racers. Instead, he swept his gaze over the boats. "They’re kind of simple."
Maybe before, he would have dismissed the boats out of hand. The technologies involved were highly refined, but the principles of propelling a boat on water remained unchanged for thousands of years. Ves did not even need to study a manual to design a boat with nearly identical performance.
Yet he did not dismiss the water vessels out of hand. Perhaps before he would have thumbed his nose at simple constructions, but ever since the honor duel, he gained a new conception of utilization.
As his eyes raked over the technical construction of the boats, he found that he could spot a subtle difference between each vessel. Ves could vaguely determine which technician was simply going through the motions and which ones pursued greater perfection in their craft.
"Even if they are just boat technicians, there’s a difference between a passionate one and a passionless one."
None of the boat technicians impressed Ves in terms of their technical prowess. If they had the ability to become a mech technician, then they wouldn’t be out here tinkering with boats. Yet Ves had seen many mech technicians who were worse than some of the boat technicians at work right now.
"Ves! Let’s head over to the betting station!" Tiss called as Ves was lost in thought. "I’m putting my money on Handsome Martinez! Just look at his smile! He’s a total winner!"
Ves absentmindedly followed the group towards a betting station that was probably responsible for handing out the prize money to the winners of the race. He put a hundred marks on Handsome Martinez without much consideration.
"I’m telling you, Goosewing Red is definitely going to end up first! Just look at how hot she is!"
"No way, man! Mimi Stellion is the best babe around! I’ve put five-hundred marks on her name!"
After several days of contemplation, Ves could finally identify the crux behind utilization. Studying the boats and comparing the handicraft of the technicians against each other was no different than comparing different mechs. This was because the principles governing utilization applied to the entire engineering field, whether it was crafting toys or crafting mechs.
"The difference lies in passion!"
To be more accurate, the difference in quality came from the drive or motivation to improve. This was such a simple idea that most people instantly dismissed it as a platitude after hearing it. After all, wasn’t it already common sense that more motivated people produced better results?
"There’s a difference, though, especially when it concerns craftsmanship."
As the techs finished up their tuning and the boats raced off into the water, Ves watched the performance of the boats. Though the skills of the individual boat racer was the prime factor in whether they gained a lead, the quality of the boats played a major role as well.
Ves experienced a quiet breakthrough in thought. As most people around him cheered for their favorite racers, he alone focused on nothing but the boats.
"The will to improve! The desire to progress! That’s it! That’s the key!"
Every passionate craftsman desired to improve their craft. As long as they persisted in this motivation, they would eventually widen the distance between themselves and those with other motivations.
Having gotten in touch with many mech designers, Ves recognized the differences in mentalities between them. If Ves disregarded their ranking and ability, the underlying difference became very clear.
The most impressive mech designer Ves had recently met was undoubtedly Gabriel Creta. The man not only refined his craft to a very high level, but from their brief talk Ves had sensed that the man constantly strived for more!
"This is how a mech designer ought to behave!"
Though his learning ability held him back from breaking through to Journeyman, the man’s indomitable motivation kept driving him forward. Ves estimated Creta would certainly able to advance in the next five years. His mentality and breadth of experience was too abundant to remain stuck in the Apprentice stage.
In contrast to driven men like Mr. Creta, Ves also encountered scores of low-ranking mech designers who had given up. Some of them had been drafted in the Mech Corps and currently served under his command. Others eked out a unprestigious existence in the private market as mech appraisers or mech repairers.
"These sideline jobs aren’t enough to advance a mech designer. Only by designing mechs can someone of our profession truly improve."
The hierarchy of mech designers resembled a very wide and short pyramid. It only possessed a few layers, but the base was enormous compared to the tip. Too many mech designers lingered at the bottom level and never saw any hopes of advancing to a higher level.
Some mech designers only took months to advance from Novice to Apprentice. Others needed decades to reach the same height, while the vast majority never succeeded in taking the first step at all in their lives.
This highlighted the need for opportunity as well as motivation. Those with no ability or connections wouldn’t be able to survive in the mech market. Ves had always fallen into the trap of thinking that his System-granted gifts would be sufficient to ride the tide to success.
Now he realized that such a mentality wouldn’t gain him much in the larger scheme of things. Passively accumulating libraries-worth of knowledge was like depending on brute force to open a vault. He could smack the vault door with his fists all day and not even make a dent on the surface.
What Ves really had to do was to open the vault doors through the correct procedure, whether that was deciphering the right entry codes or fashioning the right keys.
Between brute force and finesse, mech designers always emphasized the latter over the former. The key to designing a mech that was far more than the sum of its parts was to employ the greatest amount of finesse.
"Utilization, motivation and opportunity all comprise the essential keys to advancement."
Ves understood a little better why the mech industry only started to take a mech designer seriously when they reached Journeymen. It wasn’t just a matter of knowledge. Ves wasn’t conceited enough to think he was the only Apprentice in the galaxy with an overabundant supply of knowledge stuffed in his head.
Why were many Journeymen able to advance despite possessing a much more shallow foundation in knowledge?
"It’s because they’ve tempered themselves to the point where they can already design great mechs with only basic knowledge!"
Ves did not share the same opportunities as genuine talents such as Oleg or Patricia, but he possessed an even greater chance in the form of the System. He always thought that as long as he milked the System, he would eventually be able to catch up and surpass his peers.
"Riding the river downstream will only lead me to the sea. There’s no challenge to overcome if I ride the current. In order to temper myself and polish my utilization, I’ve got to swim against the current! Only by going upstream with I be able to reach a higher elevation!"
Ves had found his way.
Perhaps many other mech designers already realized this insight from their superiors. Unfortunately, Ves did not have too much contact with other mech designers, let alone his nominal Master.
While Ves thought it was best to minimize contact with more perceptive mech designers in order to keep his secrets safe, he also found it a pity to miss out on useful little nuggets like this. Fumbling from Apprentice to Journeyman on his own was like treading a bumpy path. Every so often, he tripped or stumbled against an obstacle. With no one to lead him to the other side, Ves had to rely on his own efforts to make it through.
"It’s not that big of a deal, though. I’m progressing fast enough as it is. This insight happened to come at the right time."
Certainly, Ves wanted to become a Journeyman sooner rather than later. He faintly thought that if he kept to his old habit of gathering more and more knowledge, it wouldn’t do any good with regards to his advancement. The sheer breadth of knowledge contained within his mind might even become a giant distraction!
"I’ve acquired far more knowledge than an Apprentice should possess. Studying more is not going to be useful to my development. Instead, I’ve got to focus primarily on designing new mechs."
Practical experience polished his utilization of knowledge. Ideally, Ves would eventually reach the point where he was able to combine basic theories into amazing products!
"However, mindlessly designing more mechs won’t cut it. I’ve got to form a solid drive towards improving my mech design ability."
Ambition welled within his mind. Ves did not feel the need to formulate a concrete motivation. Merely wishing to reach the pinnacle of mech design was bold enough to work for a lifetime. Ves had always hung onto his dream after he first received the Mech Designer System.
The only difference between now and then was that Ves knew he had to work for it regardless of his advantages. Solely relying on the gifts exchanged from the System hadn’t strengthened his mech design mentality at all. He needed to fight for what he wanted.
"A passive ambition is merely a daydream. An active ambition is a goal that I am striving towards."
In the analogy of comparing between drifting downstream and swimming against the current, the latter resulted in a lot more harvest. Perhaps unconsciously Ves had already taken this difference to heart.
"Maybe this is why I’m eagerly attracted to challenges and adventure."
Staying in his private workshop for years on end in order to churn out mech design after mech design didn’t seem like an attractive prospect to Ves. Yet many mech designers adhered to such a brutal schedule, thinking that each additional mech would bring them closer and closer to advancement.
The mech designers working for design studios basically turned into slaves that robotically produced design after design. Their efficiency was low, because the odds of producing a lackluster design was very high. Only the rights of one in twenty or one in forty designs might be sold or licenses. And this was already a good conversion rate in the mech industry.
"A mech manufacturer can’t operate like that. A company like the LMC needs quality over quantity when it comes to designs."
Low-performing mech models often led to severe losses to the mech manufacturer. Producing ten straight loser designs not only ate away a company’s reserves, it also impacted its reputation in a negative way. If a mech manufacturer was perceived as having ’lost its way’, they would lose at least half of their loyal customer base overnight.
A mech manufacturer on a downward trend had a very large chance of going bankrupt!
Ves never believed that producing the most amount of designs in the least amount of time was a recipe for success. He had always produced his designs depending on his needs and after a process of accumulation. His personal experiences provided him with fertile soil to develop new designs.
"I’ve been swimming upstream all this time without realizing it." He uttered to himself. "If I really wanted to, I could have avoided a lot of danger. Yet that would have also made me miss out on a lot of opportunities."
He summed up the major events in his career so far. The Young Tigers Exhibition. The Leemar Open Competition. The Groening mission. The Glowing Planet campaign. The Detemen Operation. The escape to Reinald.
Sprinkled with a few other challenges such as the recent honor duel, all of these experiences made him grow as a mech designer. From a fresh-faced graduate to a seasoned hand in the mech industry, Ves could never have reached this height by acting as a shut-in who perpetually locked himself in his workshop.
At first, the System prompted him out to do something by issuing missions to him. Later on, it largely fell dormant. Perhaps the reason why it rarely issued him a mission was because he was already on the right track. Ves craved for excitement and challenges even if he didn’t consciously realize it. Now that he became aware of the reason behind his proclivity to adventure, nothing much had changed.
He was still the same Ves, only now he became more cognizant of his urges. No matter what, knowing why he felt different than many other mech designers was definitely a benefit. The importance of this realization couldn’t be overstated.
The difference between an ape and a human was that the former acted on instinct while the latter acted on conscious thought.
It always disturbed him a bit to crave excitement despite his profession as a mech designer. He thought that while the experiences definitely allowed him to learn something new, this path to growth was an unconventional one. He felt like he was a deviant in a crowd of normal mech designers. Was there something wrong in his head?
Now he realized he had nothing to worry about his supposed abnormality. It wasn’t the Larkinson blood and heritage that drove him to the edge of danger. His urge to head out in the galaxy and explore new sights came from his inner desire to swim upstream.
It didn’t particularly matter what kind of events he encountered. As long as they challenged him in some way, he inevitably walked away as a better mech designer than the day before.
Lots of thoughts passed through his mind. The boat race happening in front of him became a very distant event. Ves didn’t even care he lost his bet on Handsome Martinez.
As the Vandals leisurely enjoyed their stay on Harkensen I, his mind had already been cast towards the future. He felt he needed to define his future in order to drive his ambition from a passive state into an active state. Solid goalposts were easier to meet than distant aspirations clouded in fog.
"First, the Avatars of Myth needs to be more than a personal protection force."
Ves created the Avatars for multiple reasons. Not only did he wish to set an example to the market of what an outfit equipped entirely with his mechs could do, he also wanted to rely on them to proactively seek out adventure.
Whether he was fulfilling a mission for the Clifford Society or crossing into the frontier in search of treasure, owning an outfit completely loyal to him was an essential requirement. Ves would be a monumental fool to continue to rely on mercenary corps or private security forces to keep him safe!
His firsthand experiences with the Flagrant Vandals allowed him to become familiar to the inner workings of a large mech unit. Though a military mech regiment could not be equated to a private mech outfit, copying some of their best practices was probably a good deed.
"With enough numbers, a lot of opportunities will open up. If something can’t be done by a single mech company, then what about three?"
If Ves wanted to make full use of the Avatars of Myth, then he should definitely expand its ranks. "I don’t need to grow it to an exaggerated extent. The standard of a mech regiment works for the military, but will not necessary work for the private sector."
Large-scale mercenary corps existed with thousands of mechs on their combat rolls. Only rarely did they gather together in order to fulfill a momentous assignment.
Ves did not aim to start up a mercenary corps where his mechs would be hired out to other employees. Thus, he did not feel the need to field enough mechs to conquer an entire planet. Matching the numbers of the Verle Task Force wasn’t necessary either.
"Hm, five companies of mechs should be good enough. That’s strong enough to bully around most fleets in the frontier."
Naturally, Ves needed to balance out the numbers between landbound, aerial and spaceborn mechs. The only problem was that Ves had not yet produced a serious original design in the latter two categories.
"This should be my next priority. I have to round out my mech catalog as fast as possible."
A mature mech manufacturer developed and sold entire product lines of mechs. These were mechs that shared many commonalities with each other, such as technologies, parts and design standards. An outfit that utilized multiple mech models from the same product line faced a much smaller logistical burden than if they utilized a wide variety of mechs.
The Vandals suffered somewhat from this problem due to their wide variety of random mech models. Each of them centered around different sets of core materials and technologies that it had been a daily nightmare for Ves as a head designer to keep it all together.
"Right now, I can’t develop an aerial or a spaceborn mech, but I should at least pave the way if I decide to start in this direction."
Ves already became somewhat familiar with flight systems and the anatomy of spaceborn mechs from his time with the Vandals. Working constantly on the Inheritor and Hellcat mechs combined with the tutelage he received from Laida gave him a solid footing in this area.
"If I want to design a spaceborn mech, I can already produce a decent attempt."
That wasn’t enough for Ves. If Ves wanted to pad the Avatars of Myth with mechs meant to keep him safe, then he had to go the extra mile and thoroughly master the intricacies of spaceborn mechs.
Taking a page out of the new book, Ves did not aim to solve his inadequacies by binge-reading textbooks on flight systems and spaceborn mechs. He already possessed the required knowledge to design a spaceborn mech from his existing Skills.
Rather than read a manual on how to combine those disparate pieces of knowledge from different Skills, perhaps Ves might be able to achieve a greater harvest if he compiled a method of his own.
"It’s the difference between playing an existing song or composing a new song as a musician. Retreading existing work allows me to catch up faster and enables me to produce better output on the fly. But would I really be able to become a good musician? An imitator has never attempted to climb out of their molds are destined to be forgotten."
That said, composing his own songs may likely lead to a lot of bad or mediocre songs at the start. Perfection couldn’t be reached in a single bound. Yet if Ves was willing to grit his teeth and tough it out, he was much more likely to sustain his growth trajectory after all of the imitators reached a halt in their progress.
Ves thought back on the strange theory proposed by Morgan who he met during mech designer boot camp. The older mech designer might have been onto something when he proposed that rushing to Journeyman with an insufficient foundation may stop them from advancing to Star Designers.
It was unfortunate that Morgan took a detour while he was on the right track.
