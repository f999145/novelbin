      "The alcohol concentration of the cocktail was not high, it was more like juice than alcohol.\n",
      "After Jiang Chen walked away, the restrained Xia Shiyu finally felt relieved.\n",
      "“As long as I’m still alive, no one can hurt him,” Ayesha said softly.\n",
      "However, it is also true that it is time to relax after working so hard for so long.\n",
      "“I advise you to think carefully,” Wang Biao said with a grin. There was a glimmer of mischief in his narrowed eyes. “Do you know who our boss is?”\n",
      "“Our boss wants to invite you for a drink. Can you give him the opportunity?”\n",
      "“Is that true? But I haven’t heard of you before.”\n",
      "“Beauty, what’s your name?”\n",
      "Seeing that the person in front of him did not answer, Wang Biao who was ignored twice was completely irritated. It was the first him being so humiliated and insulted since gaining his reputation.\n",

      "Wang Qian’s outstretched hand seemed to be embedded in a transparent wall. He couldn’t swing down to react back as he face gradually became bloated.\n",
      "Following Wang Biao’s sight, Xiao Shiyu saw the man sitting on the sofa in the corner. The man, who had girls on his left and right, raised his glass to her in what he thought was a cool move. That unconcealed smile made Xia Shiyu feel nauseous.\n",
      "The voice of dissonance came from his back, Wang Biao frowned and turned his head.\n",
      "“You dare to be distracted while talking to me? Are you bored of living?”\n",

      "Looking at the little pawn in front of him, Jiang Chen sighed.\n",
      "Optical invisibility gradually dispersed, and Zhu Yu, who was standing in front of Jiang Chen’s body, held the man’s hand calmly. The power of genetic vaccines was not something a thug could test.\n",
      "“Who is he?”\n",
      "Xia Shiyu felt comical at this point. Why are there so many people who feel so good about themselves?\n",
      "The change took place in an instant so that everyone didn’t respond in time. The onlookers first saw the scene and then moved back to avoid being injured accidentally. The bartender still wiped the glass in a calm manner. While she was mixing the drink, she already recognized Jiang Chen, but she didn’t say anything. The heart of Xia Shiyu was about to jump out but it quickly settled back in its place.\n",
      "Wang Biao licked his lips and reached for Jiang Chen’s neck while the other hand pulled out a bottle.\n",
      "The dimmed lights made the man’s face undistinguishable. But from the outline, he seemed familiar, but he couldn’t remember where he had seen him before.\n",
      "That cold attitude made Wang Biao feel embarrassed as he slightly narrowed his eyes. In front of his boss, he patted his chest and promised that he could bring back any woman his boss is interested in.\n",
      "Xin was just like the United States in the 19th century. It was not just immigrants who longed for a good life, but also criminals who have crossed the ocean. If this hidden danger was not solved as soon as possible, it would surely ferment into serious public security problems in the future.\n",
      "The light here was dim. There were only a few that saw Zhu Yu appear out of thin air.\n",
      "Because she suddenly realized that being protected by the Ghost Agent, how could Jiang Chen be hurt by this little thug?\n",
      "“Have you heard of the Green Dragon Clan?” Wang Biao said in a tone that was certain she would know him. “People on the streets know that nobody ever dares to say no to me, Biao Zi. I advise you to be obedient. Don’t blame me for not warning you if something happens to you.”\n",
      "“It’s not necessary.”\n",
      "He made up his mind that he must press him in the toilet and teach him how to be humble.\n",
      "“Who are you?”\n",
      "“Beat her!”\n",
      "Facing the woman who appeared “out of thin air”, Wang Biao;s eyes widened quickly. [Did I just see a ghost or am I drunk?]\n",
      "It seemed imminent to do something.\n",
      "Zhu Yu was indifferent to the cries of the crowd, but she whispered to Jiang Chen in the communication channel, asking what to do.\n",
      "“Don’t be a pus*y, fight her.”\n",
      "Seeing the unrest on this side, crowds of onlookers gathered around and shrieked.\n",
      "Jiang Chen did not answer, but went around Zhu Yu and stood in front of Wang Biao.\n",
      "“Fu*k, you can’t even beat a woman, are you still a man?”\n",
      "“I don’t care if you are a green dragon or a white tiger, or whether you are a Biao Zi or a b*tch (homophone),” Jiang Chen said smilingly, and then finished the sentence with what made Wang Biao look like he fell into ice. “If you have heard of Future Group, then you should know who the real ‘boss’ is.”\n",
      "However, Wang Biao didn’t dare to start something. He had gradually realized that he has picked on the wrong person\n",
      "Releasing the girl wearing heavy makeup from his arm, Li Qiangsheng stood up and gestured to the thugs next to him and slowly strolled over.\n",
      "“Qiangsheng, Biao Zi seemed to have messed up,” the beautiful woman lying in his arms coyly complained.\n",
      "After recognizing Jiang Chen’s identity, Wang Biao’s face instantly turned as white as ash. The beer bottle in his hand also dropped to the ground.\n",

      "“Gentleman, you dare to touch my brother on my turf. Are you tired of living, tired of living, or tired of living?”\n",
      "Jiang Chen turned his head slightly and intriguingly said.\n",
      "People wearing Green Dragon black T-shirts came out of the crowd and a group of young people with buzz cuts approached Jiang Chen. From the posture of these people?and the items in their hands, they were obviously part of a gang, a professional organized crime.\n",
      "“You little devil, don’t make trouble. When I fu*k those two, I’ll fu*k you again.”\n",
      "The dim light was flickering, and Li Qiangsheng, the head of the Green Dragon Clan, who was not far away, saw one of his thugs was being held by a female bodyguard. He frowned.\n",
      "[Chick? What is a chick?]\n",
      "Who is the real boss?\n",
      "He couldn’t help but feel annoyed just at the thought.\n",
      "“Oh? Then why don’t you tell me how to fix this?”\n",
      "“Boss...” Wang Biao looked at Li Qiangsheng. He could barely finish a proper sentence.\n",
      "A few steps behind Jiang Chen, Li Qiangsheng twisted his neck and grinned.\n",
      "After licking his dry lips, Li Qiangsheng’s eyes glanced between the two stunning beauties beside Jiang Chen. Although one has an indifferent attitude, that gorgeous face was simply irresistible. The female bodyguard also didn’t look bad, but her face was still young and adolescent.\n",
      "They really don’t want to live anymore. Who on the street doesn’t know that this street was Green Dragon’s turf?\n",
      "As the saying goes, comparisons are odious. Look at the garbage in his hands.\n",
      "This question seemed to be simply nonsense.\n",
      "“Hehe, either you leave two fingers here, or lend your chick and your bodyguard to me for two days.”\n",
      "Xia Shiyu suddenly blushed, but her expression quickly turned into fury.\n",
      "“Don’t be afraid, leave this to me,” Li Qiangsheng said. Seeing that his thug was so “touched” that he was about to cry, he acted even more recklessly. Looking at the back of Jiang Chen, the fierceness of his speech intensified. “You dared to touch my people, today if you can get out of this bar perfectly fine, I will write my name Li Qiangshengbackwards!”\n",
      "A bodyguard stepped forward and stood next to Jiang Chen. He bowed his head respectfully, waiting for his instructions.\n",
      "The screaming and howling in the club filled the dance floor. It was completely one-sided. The onlookers were completely stunned as a one-sided beat down was not entertaining at all. The bouncers of the bar stood afar and didn’t dare to step forward.\n",
      "Jiang Chen turned around.\n",
      "“Yes!”\n",
      "“Qiang Sheng Li, the name doesn’t seem to be very great. What about She Qiang Shang?(C*m on the wall)?”\n",
      "Just as he was preparing to get the thugs to fight, a dozen muscular figures wearing sunglasses pushed their way into the crowd. Li Qiangsheng frowned slightly, but when he saw the symbol of Celestial Trade, his face turned green instantly.\n",
      "...\n",
      "Jiang Chen suddenly burst out laughed.\n",
      "He smiled and looked at the now pale Li Qiangsheng and said emotionlessly.\n",
      "At this moment, Li Qiangsheng finally saw his face.\n",
      "“You—”\n",
      "The bodyguard nodded and then turned around to look at Li Qiangsheng with a smirk on his face.\n",
      "Wang Biao was tossed away by Zhu Yu with one hand. Jiang Chen sat back down at the bar and looked at the bewildered bartender.\n",
      "At this time, Wang Biao who had been quivering for a long time, finally said the words stuck in his mouth\n",
      "Although the problem was solved, the mood was completely ruined. Especially when they know he was here, Jiang Chen could clearly feel that the DJs in the bar lowered the volume by two decibels.\n",
      "Cleaning up the thugs that ruined the mood didn’t take a long time. The bodyguards of Celestial Trade easily pinned all those people down to the ground. The police finally arrived at the scene. When Jiang Chen revealed his identity, the police officers did not ask who started the conflict and immediately handcuffed Li Qiangsheng and the others with bruised faces and got them into the police cars.\n",
      "“Throw all of them into the police station. If you miss one of them, don’t come back to see me.”\n",
      "It was at that moment when the last bit of life finally left him. This street was the turf of the Green Dragon Gang, but the entirety of Xin was Jiang Chen’s turf.\n",
      "When he heard Jiang Chen ridiculing him, Li Qiangsheng was instantly ignited.\n",
      "A dozen bodyguards walked toward the thugs. The obedient ones were handcuffed while the disobedient ones received a fist to the face. These street thugs were no opponents to these quasi-military soldiers, they were crying in despair.\n",
      "“Give me a Pina Colada, add more ice.”\n",
      "Despite how strong their background was, not even the president could save them.\n",
      "After ordering a few more cocktails, Jiang Chen left a few notes on the table and then left with Xia Shiyu.\n",
      "“Boss... run... fast!”\n",
      "In front of the converted Lamborghini, Jiang Chen opened the door and sat in the driver’s seat. He looked apologetically at Xia Shiyu, who sat next to him.\n",
      "“Mhmm…” Xia Shiyu nodded, the watery pupils was dyed with the color of memories.\n",
      "T/his chapter is updat/𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.c/o/m\n",
      "Bathed in that avid sight, Xia Shiyu awkwardly moved her body and pretended not to see it.\n",
      "A fresh cool breeze blew across his face, slightly wafting away the alcoholic smell.\n",
      "The car parked slowly next to an empty road.\n",
      "Perhaps because of the alcohol, she had a faint red blush on her face. The fragrance of her body’s scent was mixed with a hint of intoxicating red wine. Her soft hair rested against her cheek and was extremely attractive under the pristine moonlight.\n",
      "“Reminiscent?”\n",
      "“I’m sorry. I wanted to bring you here so you could relax, but it ended up making you unhappy.”\n",
      "The atmosphere inside the car made her very uncomfortable, but she didn’t dislike it.\n",
      "That same night, Jiang Chen saved her from thugs collecting debt from her. The only difference may be merely that he had nothing at that time and now there were many people working for him...including herself.\n",
      "Their breathing turned louder. Who was the aggressor? Inside the tinted windows, the lips of the two people gradually approached and finally pressed together.\n",
      "“Mhmm, do you remember that day?”\n",
      "Jiang Chen was intoxicated.\n",
      "“It’s okay.” Xia Shiyu shook her head. The cold face suddenly turned into a rare smile. “Thinking about this, I’m really reminiscent.”\n",
      "Her suppressed feelings uncontrollably erupted from the bottom of her heart.\n",
      "The moonlight was shining, the palm tree leaves swayed. It wasn’t just the tree’s shadows that swayed, but the hearts of the two people in the car.\n",
      "“Are you talking about three years ago?” Jiang Chen laughed.\n",
      "The narrow space was always the catalyst for intimacy. Feeling the temperature in his eyes, the red blush seemed have climbed up from her white neck to her earlobes. Their heartbeats gradually amplified, and it gradually became unclear who it belonged to.\n",
      "Or giggling.\n",
      "Chapter 733: Five Senses Blocked\n",
      "Perhaps it was because of the pristine moonlight, perhaps it was because of the atmosphere, but when he kissed Xia Shiyu’s lips, he didn’t feel any repulsion, but he felt the warmth from the thin lips and the gradual hunger and thirst…\n",
      "“Uncomfortable?”\n",
      "“It’s okay.” Staring at the intoxicated but apologetic pupils, Jiang Chen smiled. “It’s me who should apologize. I can’t give you the promise you want but I kissed you.”\n",
      "Translator: _Min_ Editor: Rundi\n",
      "However, Xia Shiyu, who never experienced before, took his lie for the truth and thought he really endured for her.\n",
      "However, although she rejected him, she didn’t push him away.\n",
      "[Don’t let me say it once more! Bastard!]\n",
      "“I... I heard that when men, you know, if they can’t relieve it, it would… be uncomfortable.”\n",
      "Subconsciously touched his lips, he could still feel a trace of temperature there.\n",
      "However, unfortunately, the two didn’t go to the last step.\n",
      "There was a flash of hesitation in her eyes; she bit her lower lip and whispered.\n",
      "Replaced by...\n",
      "“Then... I’ll help you to get it out. It won’t be uncomfortable then.”\n",
      "After driving Xia Shiyu home, Jiang Chen drove alone on the road in the suburbs of Coro City.\n",
      "“Perhaps ... a little bit.” When Jiang Chen said this, his face turned red for lying.\n",
      "Xia Shiyu gritted her teeth and punched Jiang Chen.\n",
      "He clearly felt Xia Shiyu’s feelings for him and he had long decided to be true to his feeling. However, too much happened during this period, so neither of them took a step forward, but instead, they maintained an intimate but indirect relationship.\n",
      "When Jiang Chen’s hands were around her waist, Xia Shiyu became rational again. With the slightest sense of rationality remaining, she told him that she didn’t want to go to the last step before marriage. When he learned this point, he didn’t force anything and stopped himself.\n",
      "“Is It... uncomfortable?”\n",
      "“I’m sorry...I can’t give it to you.”\n",
      "“Well... wait, what did you say?”\n",
      "Recalling the scene that had just happened, he couldn’t stop smiling.\n",
      "…\n",
      "A white dress swayed with the sea breeze. Her face didn’t look too lively, but a sweet smile could be seen. She stood there, standing in front of the curve, looking directly at Jiang Chen driving towards her.\n",
      "The southern end of the island was not far. Follow this straight road, and then turning and driving for another two blocks, the mansions on the southernmost side could be seen.\n",
      "Then she reached out to the water bottle that was placed on the side of the driver’s seat...\n",
      "If she was not a lunatic, then she must be suicidal!\n",

      "It was not just his sight, but also his hearing, touch, and even taste and smell were affected. The five senses were covered by the glaring white light.\n",
      "The modified Lamborghini created a beautiful mirage of light on the road. The tail wing was able to pass over the highway guardrail and stop on the road behind the curve.\n",
      "Recalling what happened in the car, Jiang Chen’s lips formed a curvature subconsciously again; it almost went all the way to his ears. He turned on the radio, switched off the air conditioner, and lowered the window. The night breeze blew on his face, dispersing the intimate emotion in the wind and it drifted afar with the melody.\n",
      "Jiang Chen frowned slightly and pressed on the horn.\n",
      "However, just then, Jiang Chen suddenly saw a person in the middle of the road.\n",
      "Ending this Unparalleled state, Jiang Chen unbuckled his seat belt and stepped out of the vehicle with a rifle from his storage dimension.\n",
      "At that moment, he was driving at a speed of 100 kilometers per hour!\n",
      "Jiang Chen was about to break when all of a sudden, he seemed to see a ray of piercing light aimed directly at him.\n",
      "With a low groan, Jiang Chen instantly activated Fury, and Unparalleled immediately.\n",
      "His five senses returned.\n",
      "To be precise, it was a girl.\n",
      "The roadside lights disappeared and reappeared to form a gorgeous ray. The palm trees on both sides gradually turned sparse and the scenery turned into the open sea.\n",
      "The horn sounded, but the girl remained still.\n",
      "There was no doubt that the woman standing in the middle of the road was?one of the people with superpowers. And just then, she used a mind oscillation to attack him while he was driving 100 kilometers per hour.\n",
      "It was too late to brake!\n",
      "The five senses that were covered did not return, but in the whiteness, his hands and feet moved. The tools in his hands were harnessed to the extreme, using his instincts to avoid and react. Even if he couldn’t see or hear, simply based on the memory of the road conditions, he lifted the hand brake and spun the steering wheel.\n",
      "The road on the coast was pitch dark, as if was never illuminated.\n",
      "Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are p/u/blished on no/vel(/bin(.)c/o/m\n",
      "The eyes were blinded with glaring lights, like an incandescent light, flashlight, or a lighthouse on the coast. The light magnified in his field of vision and gradually turned everything white.\n",
      "“Certainly worthy of the name Mr Jiang Chen. I thought you were dead for sure.”\n",
      "The two were 50 meters apart. Jiang Chen was not sure of the distance of her attack, so he was careful not to approach. He just held the rifle in his hand and locked the crosshair on her\n",
      "Is it a fish that escaped the net?\n",
      "“Stand up there and don’t move. Put your hands on your hand and kneel down! I swear I won’t pity you.”\n",
      "Like murmurs in a dream, the sea breeze continued to blow.\n",
      "A bullet penetrated her head and the girl silently fell on the icy highway.\n",
      "Blood flooded out of the young girl’s mouth and dripped down her lips. Before her death, her eyes kept staring at Jiang Chen. The lips seemed to be mourning something.\n",
      "The only thing he could do was end her misery.\n",
      "“Who are you? Did the Kurofune send you?” Jiang Chen furrowed.\n",
      "If anything odd happened, he would pull the trigger and kill her.\n",
      "However, contrary to Jiang Chen’s surprise, the girl shook her head and smiled.\n",
      "He put the rifle back into his storage dimension and slowly closed his eyes.\n",
      "“Parents? Wait! Stop!”\n",
      "Or, cursing something.\n",
      "From the face, the girl should be Asian. However, according to the list provided to him by Mitsui, there shouldn’t be anymore Kurofune members in Asia.\n",
      "“No, I just wanted to take revenge for my parents. This is really unfortunate; it seems that I have failed.”\n",
      "After hearing Jiang Chen’s warning, the girl not only didn’t show the slightest fear but actually started to laugh.\n",
      "The girl didn’t give Jiang Chen an opportunity to explain. She took out a dagger and stabbed it into her heart...\n",
      "He did not know why she hated him, and why she was even willing to die for it.\n",
      "Gunfire echoed in the night sky.\n",
      "He closed the book, put the book aside, and gently said.\n",
      "“The identity of the assassin was found. Her parents were Kurofune members and killed by Ghost Agents.”\n",
      "He did not try to guess the ending of the story, because O. Henry’s endings had always been unexpected.\n",
      "Today he was in no mood to go out, nor did he feel like wearing the Phantom to play games, so he simply came to read. While waiting for the news of the Ghost Agents, he quietly read this novel he had read half a year ago, but never picked back up.\n",
      "The sunshine outside the window was dazzling, and Coro Island was particularly hot today.\n",
      "“She had nothing to do with the Kurofune… but we do not rule out that Kurofune members later found her and simply trained and instilled in her… the concept of hatred.” Ayesha adjusted the wording to be as brief as possible.\n",
      "Chapter 734: Please Give the Phone a Name\n",
      "Translator: _Min_ Editor: Rundi\n",
      "“What about her?”\n",
      "A gust of wind blew by and Jiang Chen looked up. Ayesha, dressed in a maid uniform, appeared at the door and walked beside him in gentle steps.\n",
      "At the request of Jiang Chen, Ayesha did not tell him the name of the girl.\n",
      "“Is that so…” Jiang Chen was in deep thought\n",
      "“Cabbages and Kings”\n",
      "The air conditioner was turned up high. Jiang Chen was sitting in the study room, quietly reading a novel. He seldom read books. Thanks to Ayesha, this elegantly decorated study room was never covered by dust.\n",
      "Hatred fueled by hatred, this was what he had expected. However, he didn’t intend to change his mind. The Kurofune must be wiped out and any excuse was not sufficient to argue against their crime against society.\n",
      "“We can add an examination to the medical checkup during immigration inspection to monitor the presence of the genetic code,” Ayesha suggested.\n",
      "Ghost agents penetrated into every area of Xin and monitored every incoming and outgoing phone call, text, byte of data in Xin’s artificial intelligence. However, to ensure the security status of each incoming passenger, it was almost impossible to complete the work for a tourist country with a traffic of several hundred thousand or more.\n",
      "“I’m very sorry. It was my dereliction of duty that you were almost assassinated last night—”\n",
      "Fortunately, although these so-called superpowers were inconceivable, they are all within the realm of nature. For example, the superheroes that could destroy everything would only exist in Marvel.\n",
      "Since Ayesha didn’t respond, Jiang Chen paused for a moment but then continued.\n",
      "For this matter, Ayesha lectured Zhu Yu for a long time.\n",
      "Although Jiang Chen’s words gave Ayesha some comfort, the young girl still did not completely forgive her dereliction of duty. If there weren’t any of them, there would at least be a Ghost Agent that would accompany Jiang Chen. However, unfortunately, the atmosphere with Xia Shiyu was too great last night. Zhu Yu, who was standing next to him, protecting him, did not dare to look at the “live show” of the two, and quietly left.\n",
      "“There are too many people who carry hidden genetic codes, even more than those who do not carry them. The difference between superpowers and ordinary people is whether the genetic code is explicitly expressed or not.” Jiang Chen said.\n",
      "What’s more, they were on their last breaths.\n",
      "Compared to the mercenaries using weapons, attacks by unarmed people were sometimes more dangerous and even more difficult to prevent. For example, the girl last night used a mental oscillation at a crucial moment.\n",
      "“No need to apologize. Raise your head.” Jiang Chen smiled. “Nobody can predict what will happen. All we can do is prevent it before it happens.”\n",
      "Biting her lower lip, Ayesha lowered her beautiful face.\n",
      "“What happened last night was nothing. My car was modified. Even if I didn’t stop the car and drove into the sea, I would at most suffer some small injuries. So, don’t feel too guilty. In that world, I have seen people with even more terrifying superpowers.”\n",
      "If it were her instead, she would certainly not shy away from watching Jiang Chen and Xia Shiyu doing naughty things, perhaps she would have joined them… Ahem.\n",
      "No one thought it would be such a coincidence. If Zhu Yu was nearby, she would certainly not hesitate to execute the girl immediately. The person with superpowers was still a person, no matter what kind of superpower, as long as the person was dead, there would be no problems.\n",
      "“His superpower had been unlocked to the third level, and he could wipe a whole province from the map… but in the end, he still died under my Light Sword.”\n",
      "“More terrifying?”\n",
      "To avoid unnecessary trouble, Jiang Chen did not disclose the assassination to the public. The body of the girl was also taken to the apocalypse for burial. The traces of her existence were erased from the world forever.\n",
      "After listening to Jiang Chen’s words, Ayesha asked in concern.\n",
      "“Mhmm.” Aisha murmured.\n",
      "“Not necessarily. Although in every sense the situation there is very confusing and chaotic, but fortunately, there is a group of people who are still pretty good, and now slowly establishing order. So, don’t worry about me too much. If there is the opportunity, I’ll take you over there for a tour…though it is not a good place.”\n",
      "With some contrast to what he had imagined, he originally thought that with Xia Shiyu’s thin skin, after experiencing such an embarrassing thing, she would surely avoid him for several days. However, the reality was out of his expectations. Not only did Xia Shiyu not hide from him, she also sat across from him at lunchtime.\n",
      "Also, he had to thank those crystals detonated by the guy named Bo Yu. Otherwise, his storage dimension would not have changed to the real universe.\n",
      "However, when the two people were eating, they mostly talked about work.\n",
      "Jiang Chen nodded with a smile.\n",
      "After a day of rest at home, he arrived at the Future Group building the next day.\n",
      "Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are p/u/blished on no/vel(/bin(.)c/o/m\n",
      "“Over there… Is that world so terrifying?”\n",
      "Jiang Chen smiled and rubbed Ayesha’s head.\n",
      "…\n",
      "Perhaps it was Jiang Chen’s illusion, but the relationship between them got a lot closer.\n",
      "“Is Future Technology prepared?”\n",
      "He cut off a piece of steak and chewed to hide his embarrassment.\n",
      "“What are you referring to?” Xia Shiyu mixed the salad dressing with the vegetables and fruits, and then picked up a tomato with her fork before sending it into her cherry mouth. However, for some reason, Jiang Chen felt the moment when the red lips bit onto the tomato, it was extremely sensual. Maybe because the salad dressing was white.\n",
      "“Mr. President, please give the phone a name.”\n",
      "“What?”\n",
      "“The phone.”\n",
      "“Future Heavy Inudstries already delivered the sample. From product quality, it is absolutely worthy of the concept ‘next generation’. In addition, I have seen Ning Huajian’s plan, and the promotion and sales channels of Future Technology are ready to go. All the work is ready and only one last thing remains.”\n",
      "Xia Shiyu smiled and used a joking tone she rarely used.\n"
